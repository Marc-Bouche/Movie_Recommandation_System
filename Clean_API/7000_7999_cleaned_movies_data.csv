Now, do not misunderstand me, I am not saying that this is a great movie. No, rather, I would put it that this is an endlessly entertaining movie. For people who cut this movie to pieces for not being realistic are kinda missing the point. Of course Iron Eagle's plot was ridiculous. But I believe its target audience was kids, and I sure remember finding this cool when I was little. Now I just find it amusing as a guilty pleasure, kinda like Road House. This movie is part of the great pantheon of 80's, kids-taking-on-the-stodgy-adult-power-structure movies. You must remember D.A.R.Y.L, Real Genius, E.T., etc. If you ask me, just watching Doug and Knotcher ""Ride the Snake"" in the beginning is worth the cost of the DVD. That whole sequence was so STUPID! But, at the same time, it was hilarious, funny, totally 80's, all that good stuff. So bottom line, Iron Eagle is a great 80's guilty pleasure. The hairstyles, the dancing, the music, the dialogue, its all funny as hell. I have Iron Eagle on DVD and to me it was totally worth $9.99 at Best Buy. If you love laughing at dated, unrealistic action movies, this one is a must-see. Oh yeah, and I think its plot was only marginally stupider than 1986's other fighter pilot action pic, Top Gun.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGY3MWIzZGYtOTliMy00YzQzLTgwNjgtNjlkYTA2Y2Y5YTVkL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQzNDI3NzY@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid","1961.0","A","122.0","Biography, Drama, Western","7.2","53.0","Sam Peckinpah","James Coburn, Kris Kristofferson, Richard Jaeckel, Katy Jurado","21,117","Pat Garrett is hired as a lawman on behalf of a group of wealthy New Mexico cattle barons to bring down his old friend Billy the Kid.","117","Peckinpah's final, haunting eulogy to the West and Westerns","Simply put, Sam Peckinpah's ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" is one of the last great Westerns ever made. Like most of 'Bloody' Sam's films, ""Pat Garrett"" was molested and cut by the studio, MGM upon its release. The film would be panned by audiences and critics. It's a shame that Peckinpah never lived to see the longer cut of the film finally released to a wider audience on VHS. It would become a cult hit and is now known as one of the best Westerns and one of Peckinpah's best. The film depicts the final days of Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofferson) before he was killed by his friend Pat Garrett (James Coburn), the newly appointed sheriff of the territory. Other than the fine performances of Coburn and Kristofferson, the film also features excellent supporting roles from famous Western regulars and members of Peckinpah's stock of actors. The long list of players include Jason Robards, Bob Dylan (also the film's music composer), Slim Pickens, R.G. Armstrong, L.Q. Jones, Katy Jurado, Paul Fix, Chill Wills, Jack Elam, Harry Dean Stanton, Richard Jaeckel, and Dub Taylor. Most of the characters are killed off in the film, violently evoking both the death of the West and Westerns.Peckinpah's two regular themes are here: the death of the West, and men living past their time and deciding whether or not they should accept change. My favorite scene in the film takes place about halfway through the film. Pat Garrett, isolated and alone, is sitting by his fire near a river bank. He sees a man about his age and his family sailing on a raft down the river. The man is shooting bottles for target practice. Garrett takes a shot at a bottle. The man sees Garrett and shoots back. Garrett then takes cover behind the nearby tree. They both are aiming at each, but just lower their guns are stare at each other. The raft continues to flow down the river. The scene, which was the reason why Peckinpah, Coburn, and almost everyone wanted to take part in the film, has so much meaning to it. 1. It references an earlier scene with Garrett and Sheriff Baker (Slim Pickens). Baker was building a boat so he could drift out of territory because of how awful it has become. Tragicaly, Baker does not get a chance to see this dream. 2. The scene also references the shoot-out between Garrett and Black Harris (L.Q. Jones). Before his death, Harris yells to Garrett ""Us old boys shouldn't be doing this to each other."" The same thing happens between Garrrett and the man on the raft. Other than the performances, the film also features some good musical pieces by Dylan. John Coquillon's cinematography is also very beautiful and haunting at the same time. Peckinpah, as always, was able to get period detail down correctly. Rudy Wurlitzer also did a fine job at the screenplay, despite Peckinpah improving most of it himself. Coburn's performance was possibly his best ever. The idea of Garrett having a lot of inner conflict was good. Garrett knew that he had a job to do, but just could not handle the fact it was his friend that he had to kill. Maybe he was the one who put the gun in the outhouse for Billy to use. It was also great to see the myth and actual facts of the last days of this incident played out.Although this film may have a few faults (some of Dylan's music and a few of his scenes), ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" is really worth the time to view now that a DVD will be released on January 10th, 2006. The Two-Disc set will feature two versions of the film. The first one is a 115 min. version editied by Peckinpah biographers Nick Redman and Paul Seydor. The second disc will feature the 122 min. version assembled in 1988. According to both men, there was no final cut to ""Pat Garrett."" The version that Peckinpah screeded for the MGM heads was just a rough cut. Either way, the DVD will now a new generation of film lovers to be able to view how costly it is when an artist cannot complete his work. Peckinpah and editiors originally had six months to edit, but the idiots from the studio cut it down to two months. I guess the new 115 minute version of the film is closer to Peckinpah's vision because of notes and interviews with the filmmaker's colleagues. No matter which version you will watch, ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" is a sad but magnificent Western made by one of the last great storytellers of the Western genre.Billy: Old Pat...Sheriff Pat Garrett. Sold out to the Sana Fe ring. How does it feel? Pat: It feels like...that times have changed. Billy: Times maybe. Not me.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGQ5MDcyOGItOGUwOS00OWRjLTkxYjAtNTZlYWJmNjU0YTA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In the opening scene she is walking down the street in a mini-skirt short enough to get any actual Catholic schoolgirl expelled (and quite possibly excommunicated) when she is surrounded and raped by a gang of bikers. This is apparently only a dream or fantasy though because she has several other, even stranger ones afterwards. She goes in for a check-up at school and winds up seducing the doctor. But just as he's about to take her temperature the naughty way, a group of her fellow schoolgirls burst in and hold the poor guy down while she castrates him (talk about a reversal of fortune!) The next fantasy if anything is even stranger--Guida is crucified (topless, of course) by evil priests and nuns and briefly flagellated, until her her schoolgirl posse and another group of nuns (in lingerie for some reason) come in and rescue her. After these interesting scenes in the first fifteen minutes, however, the movie turns into a typical domestic Italian comedy-melodrama of the era. Guida returns home to her family, which consists of a horny brother, a constantly absent father, and a ridiculously young and attractive mother (Rosemary Dexter), who looks she must have given birth to her children at about ten. Naturally, the mother is freely cheating on the father, who is himself sleeping with his secretary. Her brother meanwhile is diddling the family's improbably sexy maid. Guida herself is quite a hit with the local boys, who TWICE sneak INTO her house to watch her undress. But she finally decides to give it up to an older, local sculptor she meets on the beach.I have seen four other movies by director Silvio Amado. The two before this were excellent, top-notch gialli (""Amuck"" and ""Smile Before Death"") while the two after this (""Quella Eta Malizia"" and ""Peccati di Juventud"", both also with Guida) were much more staid (albeit nudity-filled) melodramas. You can actually see about the middle of this movie the point where the director got a lot less interesting. Rumor has it Amado became obsessed in real-life with Guida (certainly understandable) and torpedoed his own career. Whether that's true or not, she was certainly not as good of actress as the ones he worked with earlier like Rosalba Neri, Barbara Bouchet, and Jenny Tamburi. Guida was not a bad actress, but she was kind of a limited one (her acting range could best be described as ""scantily clad to completely nude""). To be fair, Guida still had her best roles ahead of her in stuff like ""Avere Vent'anni"", while Amado's were definitely behind him. This movie is certainly not a total waste of time, especially for Guida fans (i.e. heterosexual males everywhere), but aside from the surreal, bizarre fantasy scenes at he beginning it's pretty unremarkable.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzMyZTZhMTktNTA2NS00NjQ5LTg1MGUtNzk1YTA2ODQzYTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAxMDQ0ODk@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It features a compelling story line with plenty of suspense heightened by excellent acting and lovely, sensitive cinematography. However, this picture isn't for the faint of heart, so homophobes and prudes will want to give it a wide berth.The plot revolves around a series of inexplicable decisions made by Franck, a handsome, 30ish vegetable seller who regularly visits a gay beach and cruising ground. The beach is inhabited by a largely unvarying selection of men who are completely indifferent to their ""neighbors"" except for one highly specific service that they can, and often do, render one another in the nearby woods. The men exploit and are exploited with a ruthlessness that I found stunning, familiar and sad. This is a ground-breaking film in at least two ways. First, it is the most explicitly and unapologetically erotic art-house movie since Oshima's ""In the Realm of the Senses,"" except that in this case all of the on-screen sex is gay. Second, it is really not a ""gay film"" in the sense that it is actually a story about human callousness and depravity. In other words, the gay characters and gay sex are almost incidental to the true message being conveyed in this movie: that human beings can be truly, and quite casually, inhuman toward each other. This is in contrast to many other ""gay themed"" titles where the ""gayness"" of the story line is the most important element in the film's identity. One could easily make a straight version of ""Stranger by the Lake"" and it would work equally well. Nonetheless, there is most definitely a certain ""je ne sais quoi"" in ""Stranger by the Lake"" that a heterosexual picture would be quite unequipped to deliver upon.If you like your movies strong, suspenseful, lyrical and sleazy you will want to make a point of seeing ""Stranger by the Lake.""","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5MjcxODYxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzA2NjYwMTE@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I mean, she literally became Amanda.  This wasn't the usual B-movie.  The story was written in a way so, if you toned down the sex and put A-list talent in the roles, it could be a successful major motion picture.  Shannon Tweed stars as Amanda, a woman whose husband just committed suicide.  He was extremely disappointed he didn't get the promotion he so valiantly strived for.  Instead it went to his biggest rival, played by Andrew Stevens.  Amanda decides to get even by posing as a tutor, coming to help the man's son do better in school.  She puts on her insatiable feminine charms, and slowly weaves a web of seduction over the entire family.  She makes sure the wife can't interfere by drugging her liberally; she sleeps with the son, and afterwards sleeps with the father (while the son is watching, mind you, and she KNEW he was watching). Of course this makes the son turn on his father.  The ending is quite good too, and the way it ended made you actually want to cheer for Amanda!

Jackson","54,971","Professional gambler Sydney teaches John the tricks of the trade. John does well until he falls for cocktail waitress Clementine.","179","a first-time filmmaker very well on his way...","Paul Thomas Anderson's first film, Sydney (titled 'Hard Eight' by the distributors), has a story, but its more concerned about the characters, and how these actors play them. Like its inspiration, Jean-Pierre Melville's Bob le Flambeur, understanding who these people are in this seedy, desperate environment, is the key. The script is intelligent, and contains a truth that isn't found in most ""off-beat"" crime films. In fact, the crimes in the film, while not without the importance to the story, is secondary to how these people are around one another, the courtesy, the un-said things, the mishaps, and the truths. In tune with Melville, the film is decidedly European- the story is quite leisurely, almost too much so, but in the characters Anderson has created and fleshed out he has people we can care about.Philip Baker Hall, in a towering performance of professionalism (he's one of those great character actors who practically wears the years of his life on his face, not to sound pretentious about it), is the title character of Sydney. He offers Jimmy (John C. Reilly, believable in a role seemingly more like himself than his Reed Rothchild in Anderson's Boogie Nights) a cigarette and a cup of coffee, and then finds out through the conversation his mother's passed on. He offers up an intricate, but rewarding, way of making money in a casino without laying down a card (the slots, and a different scheme). Flash ahead two years later (awesome transition, by the way) where Jimmy is with Clementine (Gwyneth Paltrow, a good performance). Things seem to be going alright all around, except that Jimmy has a violent (shown off-screen, of course) run-in, and needs Sydney's help. But there's another secret that has yet to be told.All the little details of the story are accentuated by a directorial style that is usually peerless, and the tracking shots that have become paramount in Anderson's films (i.e. opening of Boogie Nights, walking through TV studio in Magnolia) are as smooth and interesting as anything from Scorsese. The Vegas Muzak is a touch that adds, like with Melville, a cool kind of touch not at all un-like film-noir. It's actually a thin line that Anderson is walking; how to make the Melville story's elements (an aging gambler past his prime, watching over the young people in their own messes, seeing the old turn to new) as one's own. I think he's achieved that in the film with a sense of sincerity with the characters dialog with each other. Perhaps Sydney has a different agenda than just being friendly. But Anderson wisely allows Hall to make the right choices with just certain facial expressions, what isn't said that counts. And the scenes with Samuel L. Jackson bring out the kind of intensity, sometimes quiet sometimes not, that hallmark his best performances. Maybe not a masterpiece, but it certainly isn't the work of an amateur, assured in his own script as a director, and in the strengths of his four key players.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmExNDIzY2ItOTNjNS00NmE1LTk4MmQtNzI2MTUyYTE1ODE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Yi Yi is a thoroughly captivating film that I enjoyed immensely, and I completely enjoyed every moment of it. The director's technique of filming a lot through windows and at wide angles gives it an almost voyeuristic feel, but this doesn't alienate the viewer, instead it gives the feeling you're watching real lives unfold, a kind of privileged 'fly on the wall' style, and the 'slice-of-life' term often used to describe Yi Yi is appropriate. The film manages to balance humor, sensitivity, and emotion. It's beautifully shot, sensitively directed, and incredibly well acted by all involved. It sounds like a cliche to say it, but it is one of those movies that has everything: cute kids, family dysfunction, reminisces of decisions made in the past, regret, love, hope, and beauty. It's an uplifting piece of filmmaking but also tinged with sadness, very human, and utterly absorbing.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDNkMGUyYzUtNjM0ZC00NDM2LWE5ZjEtMjliNzIxMmMzZThhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzAxNjg3MjQ@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Jay North (dennis the Mennace fame) arrives in India on a mission. The mission is to meet his father , a retired hunter(played by Clint walker). After an argument the 14 year old son runs away from home. A teenager full of the spirit of adventure, wants to explore the land . He then meets an Indian Hindu bay, about his age. The Hindu boy is the son of a dying saddu(Indian priest). The Saddhu tells his boy to take MAYA ( Mother elephant) and Her sacred white , baby elephant to the scared temple in a far away valley. In India the white elephants are considered Holy and hence , Invaluable. The story weaves a plot where a friendship develops between two young boys.... a friendship that transcends race, religion and all cultural differences. On the other hand the Hunter father sets off to find his son. The saga takes us through an array of human emotions..... love, hate , greed , honesty and loyalty. Since the movie was shot in 1965, it used real animals and no camera effects. In a scene, the elephant picks up the bus and throws it at the villains to save its baby.The shot is remarkable. The tiger fight of Clint walker , at the end of the movie is breath taking considering there were no camera tricks nor animation. The music of the film is amazing. Maya also won the southern Californian family film award in 1966. This is a complete family movie. The values which we still hold true in todays world. A must see!!!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFlZWIxN2EtOTM5OC00YWI5LTg5N2YtYzY3ZmQ4MTBjOTM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him, there have been mainline films worse, language-wise, than this....but this is a pretty brutal assault on one's ears. Hey, I can take a lot of it, but this got ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone, I heard a half-dozen usage's of the Lord's name in vain plus an untold number of f-words. I wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990? I couldn't have been the only one.Not surprisingly, some of the feature actors included Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this film, Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image, at least playing the Godly ""Stonewall"" Jackson in ""Gods and Generals."" Lang's role here is just the opposite: perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the film.Depressing, gloomy, semi-pornographic, repulsive: these are just a few of the adjectives people used - even some Liberal critics - in describing this story, which is painted even worse in the novel. Of course, some of the better-known critics, all extreme Libs, praised the movie. However, they were the only ones. Most critics were disgusted, as well almost all of the paying public. It's unbelievable that anyone could praise filth and garbage like this.Trust me on this: there are no good, likable characters in this entire movie. This is a mean, sick film: one of the worst of the ""modern era.""

I'd been anxious to see it since its initial release in 1993.  It surprised me in its depth and technical skill.Three points make this film outstanding.  The first is the technical skill of the director and the luscious taste of the director of photography. The entire film is a feast for the eyes, taking full advantage of elaborate costumes and exotic locations.  The second strength is in the actual storytelling.  The plot is a fascinating tragedy, it feels almost Shakespearean.  The acting is nothing short of incredible.  Some of China's finest actors demonstrate their ability to carry a story that covers 52 years.  Normally, these two strengths alone would be reason enough to see a film, but ""Farewell my Concubine"" succeeds in satisfying one more category (the bain of any epic): historical accuracy.""Farewell my Concubine"" is exceptionally accurate in portraying the monumental changes that were sweeping China at the time.  The film doesn't just treat these events as background events, but drags them right into the plot and pins the characters into their surroundings.  This is interesting when you consider that the story takes place in the Peking Opera, not the most likely place for these events to have effect.  Instead, as we see the new China emerge, we watch these vestiges of old society fall, and the work of all involved make this transition an achievement to behold.  The power of this film was not missed by Chinese censors who banned, removed, and then banned the film again several times over -debating whether or not its artistic brilliance was worth subversive portrayals of suicide and homosexuality.  Unlike ""The Last Emperor,"" this film was made by Chinese film makers and is in tune with its subject.  I recommend this film highly!As one last note, the version I saw was a DVD containing the original 170 minute version of the film, in its wide-screen splendor.  From what I understand, the shorter versions released internationally deleted and shortened some opera scenes for fear that they would be lost on Western audiences.  Having no prior experience with any Peking Opera, I found the scenes fascinating and integral to appreciating the entire story.  Spend the extra time if you can.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmFhZmM3Y2MtNDA1Ny00NjkzLWJkM2EtYWU1ZjEwYmNjZDQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's something that we've thought about for quite a while, though - and noted filmmakers (including Gus Van Sant and Sydney Pollack) have tried and failed to re-make films to jazz up their appeal, and make them more accessible to a wider audience.  It's something that passed through my mind quite a few times as I watched ""The Children's Hour"" today. Quite clearly, this is a film that more people deserve to see and know about, and it would certainly be interesting to try and re-make it, but we would definitely lose something in the translation.The largest reason for this is because it is a film of a definite period - the issues raised in the film are widely discussed these days, whereas in the period the film was set, homosexuality was something to be feared and despised.  Similarly, we do not have the various elaborate codes of honour that are so prevalent in the film, and dictate the actions of almost all characters.  It's a pity, then, that this film will be alien to lots of people today.  The answer, however, is not in a re-make (the film is itself a re-make of a 1936 film by the same director called ""These Three"", and an adaptation of a play of the same name by Lillian Hellman), but a re-release of this fine example of moviemaking.Boasting a terrific cast including Audrey Hepburn, Shirley MacLaine and James Garner, ""The Children's Hour"" is the story of two teachers, Miss Dobie and Miss Wright, who found a school for young girls in an idyllic town in America.  Then, out of boredom, spite and plain maliciousness, a child tells a vicious lie that will bring about the downfall of the school, the teachers, and all caught up in the horrible set of affairs.  It is quite possible to see the creeping evil and hatred that stems from Mary, the child concerned (played wonderfully by Karen Balkin).  Eventually, it reaches out and destroys all it touches.The photography is great (it was nominated for an Oscar) - there are many scenes which are so wonderfully composed that each frame paints a thousand words: the climax of the movie is a great example.  The relationship between MacLaine and Hepburn is delicately and sensitively portrayed, especially for a cast who didn't know what they were doing (according to MacLaine in an interview for ""The Celluloid Closet"").  James Garner is also good in his role as the doctor about to marry Hepburn, although the movie is clearly not aimed at giving him the best lines.  There are also many, many superb supporting roles - and the film's strength comes from a great ensemble performance.It doesn't really matter what the child accuses the teachers of (indeed we only find out a good hour into the film, although it has been strongly implied), because the film isn't really about homosexuality.  As MacLaine points out in ""The Celluloid Closet"" (a cracking documentary about the history of homosexuality in the movies), it is about ""a child's accusation"". It is also about the power held by a town to bring about the downfall of two perfectly nice, perfectly ordinary young people.  The are lines in the film that one should never forget and it should also make us think about the way our words shape the situations in which we live: (""unnatural"" is a great example).All in all, a lovely film from director William Wyler (""Ben-Hur"", ""Roman Holiday"", ""Funny Girl""), and one that deserves to be seen by a wider audience - re-release, please!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDRjYzQ4OTgtZjlmMC00ZmU2LThjYWMtNjYyM2M2NDk5NDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc0MzMzNjA@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

A career-defining performance by Tobey Maguire. Who knew that a movie about a game of chess could be so suspenseful and riveting. You won't be able to take your eyes off of it.Director Ed Zwick is the man who gave us ""Glory,"" ""The Last Samurai,"" ""Defiance,"" basically movies that have epic battlefield sequences, so it's interesting that his battlefield has been scaled down to the size of a chessboard but it's just as colossal, this is a story back in the era when the whole world was watching which of the two ideologies, United States or the Soviets would ultimately win, tension was running high but instead of bullets or nuclear weapons which both regions did have, it all came down to between Bobby Fischer (Tobey Maguire) and Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber) and even if the movie may or may not want to preach about which is the ultimate victor, it did capture the animosity in the air, so sharp it can cut through glass, the hatred against communism at the time.Written by Steven Knight, who gave us ""Eastern Promises,"" and ""Locke,"" I think Knight gives in to Hollywood's long-held fascination with brilliance and madness, it's a lot like ""A Beautiful Mind,"" where a person is so brilliant that his mind just snaps. Now, I didn't grow up knowing a lot about Bobby Fischer, my dad taught me how to play chess when I was a kid, but I was terrible at it, which is why I turned to soccer. My point is, I don't know how out of touch Fischer really was, and this movie itself is not a straight adaptation, but I think PAWN SACRIFICE accomplishes what it set out to do from the start, this correlation between genius and paranoia or insanity.Mad props to actors Tobey Maguire and Liev Schreiber who, under the direction of Ed Zwick, successfully manage to dramatize the game of chess. Because chess matches are usually silent, so everything heavily relies on the actors' facial expressions, it's all in the eyes and the body language in order to understand the game's intensity. The movie has to also entertain those who may not play chess and so it does, and it's a testament to the amazing performances by Maguire and Schreiber.The movie also brings up a good point that I think would leave the audiences conflicted. Because we would feel like Bobby Fischer would need medical treatment, but a part of us also don't want to hinder or get in the way of brilliance, out of selfish reasons of course, because we would want that brilliance to work in our favor. We badly want to see the master play but at what cost.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0MDYxNTE0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgyNjU3NTE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

That does not matter to me. It succeeds as an professionally presented film for adults.I am in no position to bellyache about how little it resembles Walter Farley's children's book. I have read some of the book. The book does not interest me.Neither does its set-up for whatever sequels interest me. They were, by most accounts, mediocre.This film, ""The Black Stallion"", holds a great deal more for me than most other pictures.The film is one of the most powerfully beautiful sets of moving images I have ever seen on screen conjoined with sumptuous music and gently mesmerizing performances. Its editing awards, cinematography awards, and the awards for its music all were well deserved.From the wreckage of the ""Drake"" through the lengthy bonding of boy and horse on the island, through to their rescue, not a word is spoken. It is one of the longest, most intensely cast verbal negative spaces in film. Civilization is dispensed with, language is removed, layers of meaning are stripped; there is no intellectual comfort on which to fall back. Into that emptiness fall the sound of waves and wind and rain as though natural extensions of Carmine Coppola's exquisite score. The film's soundtrack is wonderfully uncomplicated and moving. The island sequences are visited by small groups of instruments in turn -- a harp here, primitive percussion there, minimal woodwinds; no brass intrudes for a long time -- in musical experiments of loneliness yielding to companionship that echo the tentative meetings of the boy and the horse.Such negative spaces abound in ""The Black Stallion"", carved from the soundtrack (the roar and crush of sound in the midst of the final race sequence blur out into a blissful, quiet emptiness touched lightly by flute and brass), washed clean of visuals (for the bulk of one critical scene, horse and boy, the centers of attention, disappear, literally, and focus is on the tiniest details of ticking watch hands and empty sheets of translucent night rain), and opened at great lengths in the dialogue: Alec's mother responds to her son's plea with a tortured delay and Teri Garr, in remarkable performance, draws out her strangely active non-speech for many long seconds before her two-word reply closes this particular negative space with the thunderclap of a rushing locomotive and the thrust of a guitar as the soundtrack slams back in.The final burst of joy from the island sequence's soundtrack is so magnificent, so full and compelling, it is odd to listen, carefully, to its hesitant introduction as the horse finally permits the boy to mount: small flicks at the harp joined by a reed or two before the tympani knock insistently to tell us something miraculous has happened.And we need that wake up call: We have to come up for air. Our vantage point for Alec's first ride begins *under water*. We see only six legs and, then, much boiling and thrashing in a scene that is as intimate and anticipatory as only the best love scenes ever filmed. And this *is* a love scene, in every sense. The charging aerial streamings and broad panning shots that follow the boy and the horse and the forces of nature, the sand and ocean through which they tear, convey as deep a physicality as in any love scene.This film, with its powerful sensory immersion, offers much about love and tenderness and touch and connectedness to an audience inclined to forget that most motive force in life comes through the union of dissimilar entities and the experience of sex is, at its fullest, not just about bodies conjoined: it's also about longing and belonging and trust and completion though union with one's chosen and preferred. ""The Black Stallion"", G rating and all, is one of the most powerfully sexy films ever made. It offers every amended glory possible in any sexual relationship that proceeds past involvement of 'the plumbing'.In both illustration and disclosure of why this film means so much to me, I might as well mention I was 38 the last time I watched this movie, my first viewing of it in many years. The young lady with me had never heard of it. When, at its end, she turned to hot, liquid sunshine in my arms, weeping in amazement, not fully understanding why she'd been so moved, we began a romance that has refused easy definition ever since -- but I cannot imagine a stronger bond. The magic of this film perfectly mirrored the best possible feelings within us. A kid's movie? Sure, if you say so.This is a wonderful film. It will not push or drag you. But watch -- and listen -- closely and let it take you where it can and it will amaze you.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzgzOTgwOTEzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI2MTcyNA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It was a bit of a last minute pick, and it has been my favourite film so far, and probably one of my favourite films in general. To be simple, I will just say that this film is about life and the emotions and experiences that we all go through within it. Christopher Plummer plays a 75 year old man who after the death of his wife is finally able to explore his homosexuality, and we see him come to life through this experience. It is not only about him, but mainly about his son played by Ewan McGregor, whose relationships with both his mother and father shape him as a person. These relationships and his own romantic relationships make up the core of his character, and it is through love, loss and discovery that the three main characters display an authentic view of humanity. It is an original film, and requires a certain audience, but I recommend that everyone should see this true gem.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDE2OTA2NDctNGEzMy00Y2E1LTlmMTctOTMxYWQzYWI5OTIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQyMTMwOTk0._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Jordan and some standout work by Octavia Spencer. The sound design is particularly noteworthy. The cinema verite camera-work (No, ""M. Brand,"" the visual style here was a choice; well made student films, even cheap ones, generally look better than this) left me underwhelmed for most of the film (and honestly, the mistimed focus pulls were pretty distracting) but paid off big time in the Fruitvale sequence. There the cinematography, editing, sound design, and score combined to create the most gripping ten minutes of film I've seen in a year. I'd recommend Fruitvale on the strength of this sequence alone. Ryan Coogler admittedly takes some dramatic license with the story. Some of it (the Katie character) works, some (the bit with the dog) comes off heavy-handed. None of it gave me any reason to question the film's ""fidelity"" to the facts. The unfettered access to Oscar's family, legal documents from the criminal and civil case (including all the video taken on the scene), and the tacit approval of BART (They were allowed to film on the actual BART platform and in their cars!) gives me no reason to believe this film takes any more narrative license with the facts of the Fruitvale incident than many documentaries would.The film is not perfect. Some of the performances are subpar, some of the improvised dialogue bumps, and the day-in-the-life conceit, while not ignoring Oscar's spotty past, does paint him in an unrealistically rosy light. But by and large this is a moving, gripping, at times infuriating film that will stick with you after the credits roll. Congratulations to Coogler and his team.**As for the troll who called this film ""socially irresponsible,"" your opinion and the reasoning behind it are so abhorrent I struggle to imagine any person, no matter how ignorant or loathsome they might be, taking you seriously.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0OTU1MDkxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5OTA3OQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I watched them when they came out and was mildly amused at that time, but these Herbie flicks did not age well. I can understand why they did a remake recently.I know it's a fantasy, but it just looks now so stupid it's almost beyond description. In a nutshell, we have a 40-horsepower VW bug that wins auto races because it's ""alive,"" complete with a personality and - get this - a soul! Meanwhile, the driver of the race car (Dean Jones as the annoying ""Jim Douglas"") thinks he's responsible for the race victories. Well, at least that made sense. The film turns out to be a propaganda piece for Buddhism!! I kid you not!In fairness, Disney and other studios who have done animation have always made inanimate objects human-like and many times we laugh at that, myself included. So, I'm not really making fun of the premise but it just looks and sounds so dated 40 years later, especially the San Francisco hippie scenes.""Herbie,"" by the way, was a likable ""guy."" It was good to see Benson Fong (Charlie Chan films) again, and Joe E. Ross (Bilko, Car 54, Where Are You?) and even goofy Buddy Hackett as ""Tennessee Steinmetz.""

Anne, her late mom's friend, visits and brings changes to all.","41","Jean Seberg weaves her magical charm on the viewer like none other.","Jean Seberg is an absolute joy. I just wanna give her a big fat hug and kiss... well that's just two things anyway. What makes Otto Preminger's film so wonderful is that Seberg is the right age to play the part of a spoiled rich girl coming of age. Also the film is given an authenticity and heart because it was written by FranÃÂ§oise Sagan when she was the same age as Cecile (Seberg). That's right, this amazing and brilliant work was penned by a 17-year old. The plot is fairly standard. A young girl living with her playboy father becomes jealous of his new love and when marriage is proposed she does her best to break it up. Gee nothing remarkable there. What is remarkable is the characters and their relationships. They have an extra amount of depth and the situation between Cecile and her father, Raymond (David Niven) borders on the incestuous. This gives it an added dimension and depth when Anne (Deborah Kerr) threatens to ""steal"" her father away. Another place where it avoids clichÃÂ©s is dealing with Anne. Kerr plays her magnificently and with a warm passion. She is not the wicked step mother here, but a sympathetic and self sacrificing woman who wants to bring love and stability into Cecile and Raymond's morally ambiguous and flighty lifestyle. This film while a modest success in America was a huge hit in Europe and inspired Jean-Luc Godard to work with Seberg. Bonjour Tristesse also foreshadowed the films dealing with the idle rich that quickly popped up in its wake including two masterpieces, Antonioni's L'avventura and Fellini's La Dolce Vita. Preminger directs Bonjour Tristesse with a sure hand and I love how the flashbacks are in color and the present day scenes are in a somber black and white to fit with the mood. Oh and yes the story is told in flashback for the most part and the technique along with Seberg's narration gives a heightened sense of loss that Cecile and Raymond feel towards the events that transpired concerning Anne. Remarkable film and Seberg is so delightful and hot running around in her bathing suit practically the whole time.

The movie captures that quite well, there's a rawness to it that makes it feel like you're watching these events as they are unfolding whether they are in the present or the flashbacks. A movie that goes back and forth between the present and the past is nothing new, and someone reminiscing on their first love isn't either, but this film does a good job of it in the way it's structured. The flashbacks actually feel like memories, as bittersweet as they can be, and contrast well with Stephane now as he's still hurt by them and yet cherish them.The whole cast is great but there are standouts. Guillaume De TonquÃÂ©dec is the only actor in the cast I knew by sight but I've seen him more in comedic roles - at least that's the memory I have of him - but he nails it. His internal emotional turmoil reads perfectly as he comes back into town and meets Lucas. In the present scenes, it's mostly him and Victor Belmondo - famous last name and familiar features but the first time I've heard or seen him in anything - they are good but not as poignant as the flashbacks. Julien De Saint-Jean and JÃÂ©rÃÂ©my Gillet are just amazing in this film, their scenes give life and weight to the scenes in the present.

""Joe"" has unfairly become an industry joke, shorthand for the depths to which Tom Hanks sank before redeeming himself with Academy Awards.  This fate is horribly undeserved. ""Joe"" is an imaginative and gloriously life-affirming movie, a hysterically funny fantasy nearly on a par with the best of Terry Gilliam with a ""carpe diem"" moral that comes across with a lot more honesty and a lot less preachiness than some other movies I could mention.  Every Tom Hanks performance is virtually flawless and this one ranks near the top.  Meg Ryan's performances are warm and hilarious.  Usually it's men who play more than one role in a movie and then it's more often for ego's sake than art's. Ryan pulls off her multiple characters with remarkable grace.  More amazingly, it makes perfect sense for her to play three characters.

Frankenheimer's monster movie is partly responsible for me getting into the business (along with Jaws, Alien, Raiders, Blade Runner, not that I'm really inviting such comparisons). I actually had occasion to have a smoke and chat briefly with Robert Foxworth about the making of the picture when I was grip on a made-for-TV suspense pic in Atlanta. He was approachable, friendly and enjoyed talking about that show. He said that they had lost a stunt driver, and narrowly escaped losing a cast member or two when their first construction truck/picture car (the 4wd monster truck our ensemble try to escape in) took a dive off a cliff. They had to scramble to find another one and finish the picture. RF also said that Frankenheimer was an accomplished chef and had occasionally treated the DP and Cast to gourmet meals.Prophecy is now on DVD, presented the way it was originally shot. I think I bought my copy for less than $15. All of the criticisms of this film are true, and it does not belong in the first Frankenheimer potential box set with ""The Train,"" ""Manchurian Candidate,"" and ""Seven Days in May."" But with this marginal script and genre, bound together with a tired, preachy and inaccurate environmental message, Frankenheimer managed to put together a monster picture that has surprisingly stout legs. Remember, Paramount released this monster muppet against ""Alien,"" arguably the best film of its kind ever made. The monster grizzly is enraged, frightening and unpredictable. It is key to the film's suspense. If the Emmerich/Devlin team gave 'Zilla the same qualities, suddenly that film is worth watching for more than the effects. Prophecy had virtually no effects by today's standards. They had to make up for this with shooting and editing; a.k.a. conventional, hand-crafted filmmaking. I may indeed be prejudiced, but I still like this movie with all of its problems.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUyMmViNzMtOWRmOS00MWM0LTkxNDctODYyMzM5OWQ1YzdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He won his only Oscar for it of course, but he hadn't yet completely found ol' Rooster's voice.In this sequel co starring Katharine Hepburn, the Duke has every aspect of Rooster down pat. The scenes he and Hepburn share, trading their philosophies and anecdotes while they come to know and admire (and platonically fall in love with) each other is the engine of this film. Forget the plot, it's passable enough but very much secondary, this story gets along strictly on the strength of the two lead characters and it's worth seeing again and again just to watch these two Hollywood legends banter and spar in their one and only movie together.This was the first John Wayne film I ever saw in a movie theatre (I was 9 years old in 1975) and it made me a lifelong fan.

From the Dalle / Gainsbourg improvised dialogue (made hilarious by Dalle's very personal way of saying things - let's hope that won't get lost in translation) to the creative ways in which NoÃÂ© uses the screen space. I couldn't stress this enough: *This Must Be Watched In A Movie Theater* ! Although I do enjoy smaller screens, I'm afraid a small screen won't cut it with this one. As usual with NoÃÂ©, the experimental elements are present and the big screen is a must in order to enjoy them fully.Many references are made throughout the film to Carl Dreyer's classic ""Vredens Dag"" from 1943, also using footage from it. It does serve a purpose but cannot really be discussed without spoiling.I believe many interpretations of the film are possible. From mysogynistic to feminist. I'm definitely going with the latter. The end scene is intense in symbolism, deafening sound, flickering visuals and a creative use of the screen. If you suffer from epilepsy: STAY AWAY. As usual, NoÃÂ© tries our patience and is into trying to shock us - but that's getting a bit old. Nothing gory though, so the faint of heart can watch. The camera flies from room to room as the crescendo builds up progressively until smothering hysteria. The film only lasts 50mn but it wouldn't necessarily have made more sense to make it any longer.This is also definitely a film about film-making and how things go, on and off set. It's a film about actresses - how some can impose their strength or choose to go with what is asked of them.This film will divide. Some will see it as arty, vaccuous and pointless. Others will find depth and meaning in it, but not necessarily the same meaning. I believe this is the best NoÃÂ© film in a long time. Overall better than ""Climax"" or ""Love"". If you can get past NoÃÂ©'s antics, it is not only enjoyable, it is mostly an undeniable breath of fresh air in contemporary cinema.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjcyYWEyOGItYzMwYi00YjA2LTk5MGUtZGM3Y2UzMGQ5ZmQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY3NTY5OTcx._V1_UY209_CR5,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

However I would like to state that I am EXTREMELY surprised that no one has commented about the actual rape scene itself. I can remember watching this as a kid on Lifetime, and years later still remembering that scene to a chilling degree. In most cases for rape scenes, (at least the ones aired on television) they only get from the waist up in the shot. In this particular scene, the camera is aimed straight ahead at the rapist in a sitting position on the floor with the young girl laying out in front of him. Although there is no nudity involved, the scene is VERY graphic in nature. I don't know how in the world they got that girl to play out the scene so well, but I could actually feel her pain, as depicted in her face and screaming from being ripped apart.

So here's my 2 cents. In my opinion this was not trying to be Indiana Jones. I think the intension was to make a campy, cheesy spoof, and as that it succeeds fantastically. Keep in mind this was the early - mid 80's. Cheezeball B-movies were all the rage and popular. Look was came out in around that period. King Solomon's Mines, a year later a sequel, Lost City of Gold. But we had many other great cheese movies like Ice Pirates, Dungeonmaster, Dragonslayer, Spaceballs, just to name a few. Conan the Barbarian spawn a whole subgenre of barbarian movies as did Road Warrior for post-apocalyptic movies. I'm sure there where other movies of these subjects before, but these were the ones that really kicked it off for those subgenres. I think that many of those who are complaining that King Solomon's Mines is so bad are those who are too young to remember and appreciate these movies that came out in around that period or those who decided it's not ""cool"" to like cheesy movies.Of course you can't compare the effects to that of Raiders of the lost Ark. Raiders had a near unlimited budget for the day, how do you compete with something like that? And do you honestly think that they blatantly ripped off scenes without getting permission first? I wouldn't be surprised if Lucas is making a small royalty of these movies, or at least did back when it came out. Yes, they rode the Raiders wave. Why is it that we criticize someone for riding a winning wave? If I had the chance, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I would argue that any of these movies have more heart than most of what comes out of Hollywood these days. These were made back when, for the most part, budgets were tight and people made movies for the love of making movies.Having a weakness for violent gore movies and foreign, B-Movies and foreign probably comprise 60% of my DVD collection and 70-80% of my VHS collection. Almost 600 movies combined. But I have a rare gift to be able to sit down and watch a movie without comparison to another and judge it on it's own. That's why my collection contains everything from Little Mermaid and Aladdin to Cannibal Holocaust(Uncut) and Salo: 120 Days of Sodom(Uncut), from The English Patient to, yes, King Solomon's Mines. (I do, however, have Lost City of Gold on VHS) So sit back, try to watch movies without any preconception of what you are about to watch. Critics, friends, rumors are just that. You are your own person, make up your own mind. If you can't do this, you are probably looking at the wrong movie. All you will see is a bad Raiders rip-off and you should stick to what you know or ""reality"" *Ya Right* TV.And that's my 2 cents.ME","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjk3ZGYyZmUtYTQ3ZC00NDBjLWI5NTctNDY0OTFkMDYzNjlmL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

A really pleasant surprise because I wasn't expecting anything special. I don't know if it's meant to be a cautionary or an empowering story. The movie is about a woman who's fun and carefree all her life, the life of the party at every wedding, and is suddenly confronted with the reality of time slipping away and she doesn't have as much of it as she thinks she does. While it might resonate with women in their 30s, the emotional roller coaster of Nellie's journey, blending fun and introspection, makes it enjoyable for anyone. The movie strikes a perfect balance between drama and comedy, offering moments of laughter amid the poignant exploration of loneliness, fear, and past decisions.It's quite the tragic story, it's all fun and games at the start and then it gets sad. It was hard to imagine a happy good ending for this movie, always felt like it was gonna be sad in the second half. The ending isn't as impactful as I think it should be but it's a pretty great movie. It's meant to be empowering and remove stigma around freezing eggs, but I left the theater reflecting more about the notion of time's running out. It's sad for a huge chunk of it but I walked out with a smile because it never gets sappy. It's pretty original, well acted and the characters are great. I also love the soundtrack.The 'freezing eggs' prep talk was great. I also love the tag line ""use by 35"" like an expiration date. I'm also glad she didn't go through with the toothbrush thing. I loved the reoccurring symbolism done with Avocados. Also I really loved the doctor. I also really felt the second hand pain and embarrassment when Nellie went spying.If you think this is gonna be bad, it's better than you expect. As my introduction to Leah McKendrick's work, both writing and directing, I'm exiting to see more of her filmography. I usually don't favor actors directing and acting their own films, this one was an exception. It's a small indie movie, it's not conventional but it's one I wish was mainstream so it got more recognition. If you were on the fence about watching I recommend going, wouldn't call it one of the best movies you'll see but it's a refreshingly different and fun experience.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDJiOGE3ZjYtZTY1Mi00ODM4LWEzYWMtY2IwYjRmMDNiZDVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4NTM5NDY@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

A win-win for them both, however staining every single other crew member in the process, forcing them to be in the same cycle he is.He has lost faith with nearly every friend he had in the industry, delivers lines like he is a wooden board and hasn't got even ounce of pride in his work whatsoever. He truly is the worst of them and needs to find another career path.Problem is, every Director he has ever worked with (bar M. Night Shyamalan who gave him another shot in 'Glass') due to his conduct and ego making him be difficult to work with, made them enemies and apart from his current low budget buddies that are in it to milk his name for all it's worth until he becomes one of the world's worst fall from grace stories in hollywood, there is nothing to redeem him now in the eye's of anyone who can have faith in him to lead a blockbuster ever again. It's obvious he can't be bothered anymore to truly put anything into his work except the bare minimum and just want's his cool million to continue his cushy lifestyle with 0% effort, until the next day of 'work', repeating the cycle over and over. 7 Films in 2021 is all you need to know...This isn't Cinema.This is a sad, pathetic and tired old hustle.0/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjE1NTA2ZDEtYjYxOC00MDM3LWJkMDktMDU4OGZiZWVhMDg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMwMDA5ODU3._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's not my favorite but I admit it is very, very good....and it has some of the most touching, wonderful moments of any of her films. In fact, there were several times in the first part of this film that produced tears in my eyes. Of course, I am an old sentimentalist. Nonetheless, this is wonderful stuff.The only reason I don't rank this among my favorite Temple films is the mean old lady, ""Fraulein Rottenmeier,"" played by Mary Nash, has too big a role in the second half of the movie making for a number of unpleasant scenes. I had gotten so involved with the story that I couldn't stand to see this mean woman so nasty to ""Heidi"" (Temple). Also, there was only one song-and-dance number and that's not enough for Shirley Temple movie.The other characters were fine.

I was disappointed by the constant barrage of vulgarity, sex-related jokes, and overall trashiness.There are no role models. There are no values upheld. It is like Lord of the Flies in the sense that the kids run amok doing whatever they please. No one stops to demand respect or teach civility.Ultimately, myself and my 12 guests were too offended to finish the movie after fifteen minutes. Not at all appropriate for families.It won an award for best ensemble at Sundance. I did think the grandmother and the mother were great characters. The main character was mediocre. The sister was vulgar.The friends are worse in their vulgarity and immaturity. They call this a coming of age film. But where I live, this is not what it is like for youth.

Still, it's hard to see the good guy, the little guy, beaten up by the big guys. Here's one story where Goliath beats David. Anyway, this was an interesting supposedly- true-life story of how Preston Tucker got a raw deal form the Big Three car-makers of the day, and by the government after he built a much better automobile in 1948. The film details how the big boys made sure Tucker's company never sold any of those cars.As mentioned, it's maddening to watch at times, to hear lies and false charges brought against a man who had the right ideas about car safety and engineering and was way ahead of his time.The 1940s atmosphere in this film is very good and the old music is fun to hear, too. The cinematography is great, too, with some tinted vintage-type color at times. It looks wonderful on DVD.The car is super to look at and admire. Jeff Bridges does a solid job of portraying Tucker, an upbeat, positive-thinking inventor. It also was refreshing to see a nice, supportive family, too.

The only way to stay awake while watching Zoom is to count how many scenes, characters and story ideas are stolen from other movies. From X-Men and Sky High to Spy Kids and Fantastic 4, on and on, this movie steals from everyone. And none of it works! The most interesting anomaly is that finally there's a movie with Chevy Chase where the material is worse than he is. (Sorry Chevy, but six or seven movies not withstanding, your career consists of mostly dogs.) But the problem with Zoom is not the actors, it's the script. At least Howard the Duck and Ishtar, garbage that they were, were fairly original.

It's another movie that full of references to other movies and to the movie-making process. I recognised only little hints of Just Jaekin, being unfamiliar with the other influences. I did spot the marker tape on the carpet that serve two purposes, practical and metaphorical. Er.. three, there are two metaphors going on, I think, one plot-related and one post- modern commentary.Talking of plot, it is so slight that it could be explained in three sentences. I won't, obviously, but honestly it wouldn't matter if I did. What matters is the manner of the telling.The story inhabits a strange dream-like space where everyone in the town is a fetishistic female entomologist! (If anyone can explain the significance of the entomology, please do, I'm all ears!) But within the unreal external world, the two heroines inhabit an emotional world that is utterly believable.In sumptuous but slightly muted autumn colours, the film looks gorgeous. I found it sensual, very erotic (despite there being no more than a few seconds of anything you could call ""sex"" and no nudity at all), emotionally engaging, warm, sad, funny and REAL.Although the story deals exclusively with dominance and submission (no trace of S&M despite what it says in all the publicity, including in interviews with the director) it is a universal story about conflicting desires, fantasies, trust and compromise.

Jeffery Dahmer is a mopey, four-eyed moptop, shuffling through adolescence, dealing with a fractious household in the bland and brown seventies.Of course we all know how this plays out, and that ominous shadow creates a vicious tension throughout this excellently unsettling film. Collecting and dissolving road kill in his makeshift shed lab, is certainly cause for concern, but it is Dahmer's awkward interactions with his peers, family, and authority figures, that bring the shivers. We know there is an explosion coming, but we just don't know how or when.Based on a graphic novel by a high school chum, ""My Friend Dahmer"" focuses on the usual tribulations of teenagers searching to belong. Either bullied (nasty) or ignored (worse), Dahmer gains a strange semblance of attention by spazzing out in school. If fake epileptic convulsions means popularity, then so be it.Former Disney star Ross Lynch brings a perfect blend of desperation and dread to the complicated lead. He has issues, but what outcast teen doesn't? Among his many quirks, Dahmer's seemingly innocuous interest in a neighbourhood jogger (a running theme throughout) is one hell of a creepy sequence, even though nothing comes of it. We see a series of small events that may point to the evolution of a monster, or to a weirdo biology major.

Their family of 9 is much larger than a classic Iranian family.

This is my first ever review, so I'll see how it goes... I just saw this a few hours ago here at the Rio Film Festival and I have to say, it was one of the most charming films I've seen this year. Those who know Oscar Wilde's work should know that it is mostly based on dialog, and this is no different.. but most of it is so hilarious that even people who can't stand talk-based movies should have a good time. The real star of the show here is, in my opinion, Tom Wilkinson. Helen Hunt and Scarlett Johansson are both very good (as is most of the cast), but Wilkinson is so endearingly silly that you can't help but care for him more than the others. So what keeps it from being a stunner? The same thing that makes it good: it's the type of film you forget very easily. Nothing is ever too serious about the film and even though that is a pivotal thing in making it such a good time, it also makes it very easy for the film to slip out of your mind once it's over. Also, another thing I noticed (and thought was kind of weird, actually) was how uneven the cinematography was. You'd have one shot that was really beautiful and lush followed by one that seemed a little rushed, and not particularly worked on (those who have seen Barry Lyndon should notice that some shots, in my opinion, are incredibly similar, though sunnier - hopefully a reference, not a rip-off). But, by all means, go see it. It is a wonderful film to see with someone special, and should provide some very quotable one-liners once it comes out.A romantic comedy that is as sleek as it is clever?

I became a big fan of his work after watching this movie. Have seen a good portion of his films since.  The opening prologue is shot in a gorgeous sepia color.  The murder/torture of Schweick represents the censorship and repression of the artist.  Anchor Bay did a excellent job in the restoration of the film for DVD. The chain whipping scene in it is a repeat of the one in Don't Torture a Duckling(1972).  The chain whipping in The Beyond is much more gory. There are a couple of reasons why the chain whipping scene in Don't Torture a Duckling is more powerful and potent then in The Beyond.  The scenes take place in natural settings.  Goes for violent realism.  The death of Maciara is depressing to watch.L'Aldila(1981) was part of a trilogy called the 7 gates trilogy.  This started with The Gates of Hell(1980), continued with this film, and was to end with The Beyond 2.  Unfortunately, this trilogy would never be completed.  This is a shame because I would have loved to see that film to know if it was good as the first two movies of the trilogy.  The original intentions of The Beyond are different from the final results. This was because of budget and time restrictions.  I wonder how much better the pic might have been with a modest budget and a little more time. The make up effects is one of the film's best features.  Despite the low budget, Giannetto De Rossi's effects are spectacular.  The effects are done with flair and pizazz.  Giannetto De Rossi did his best when working with Fulci.  The effects for the death of Joe the Plumber are very good.  The best effects in the film is the scene involving the young girl near the end. The cinematography is spliced with atmosphere and style.  Sergio Salvalti contributes to the film's gothic flavour.  The cinematography contains a dreamish flow that makes the film beautiful.  The score is one of my favourites for a horror film.  The score fits perfectly with the scenes in the film.  As good as anything done for Argento by Goblin.The Beyond(1981) is an 'Absolute Film' where image and sound are the most important part of a film.  On the making of this, Fulci once said, (""My idea was to make an absolute film, with all the horrors of the world.  Its a plotless film, there's no logic to it, just a succession of images""). This is something that people who hate the film don't and will never understand. Many people do not like this because of its nonlinear structure.  He also said, ""In Italy we make films based on pure themes, without a plot and The Beyond like Inferno refuses conventions...people who blame the The Beyond for its lack of story don't understand that it's a film of images, which must be received without any reflection"".  Receiving a movie like this without any reflection is a hard thing for many film goers to do. The works of Antonin Artoud and H.P Lovecraft play a major influence on The Beyond(1981).  Fulci was inspired by this controversial French artist. The ideas of Artoud are present in most of Fulci's work.  Schweick the painter bears a little resemblence to Antonin Artoud.  Artoud was the founder of ""The Theater of Cruelty"" which talked to ""Restore to the theater a passionate and convulsive conception of life, and it is in this sense of violent rigor and extreme condensation of scenic elements that the cruelty on which it is based on must be understood"".  This idea can be applied to The Cinema and this film. The comment ""Violence is Italian Art"" by Fulci is relative to the movie and the history of Italian art.  Its one of the few films where atmosphere and gore mix well together.  Has good moments of spirital horror.  The atmosphere is eerie and terrifying.  The gory set pieces are satisfying. The surreal atmosphere and bloody imagery is what makes the film a classic. The Beyond would influence many later American and Italian horror flicks. One, The Evil Dead(1983).  Two, Hellraiser(1987).  Three, Hellbound:Hellraiser 2(1988).  Four, The Church(1990). Finally, Dellamorte Dellamore(1996). The Beyond(1981) will never be a mainstream favourite because its not for everyone.  The themes are well written by Dardano Sacchetti.  Catriona MacColl and David Warbeck are very good in the roles of the heroine and hero.  Veronica Lazar from Inferno(1980) is sinister as Martha.  The director did a great job with the little resources that he had to work with. The ending will haunt your dreams for days to come.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBlODgyNzktYTY3ZC00MzQyLWJhYzQtZTIwZTMwYjliOGZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Look up the definition of softcore porn, and everything inside of the justifications they use is all about the pornography, not about art. They had it right in the beginning in the of the film where the art of erotica is stills of natural beauty. The moment you motion for sexual intercourse, with or without penetration, auditorily or seen, is some form of porn. To have nudity isn't the issue, if done properly. To have sexual humping, motions, moaning, etceteras makes it softcore porn by definition. Nothing they say in this film does anything for the artform of nudity, such as in statues or artwork. It's a promotion for the normalization of softcore porn in the mainstream media, which is abhorrent. Especially since you see the condition of the actresses and actors mental conditions afterwards doing this type of filmography.

It is also rather irritating that Jack is dressed in blue.....the original costume director put David in blue and Jack was the ONLY one with red to set them apart from the other newsies who were rather bland.

In the Blood is clearly BOTH of theseÃ¢ÂÂ especially the latter. The amazing thing is that although the violence made me cringe, it was also a movie that kept me glued to the screen...and my adrenalin pumping!The film stars Gina Carano and if you've never heard of Miss Carano, I wouldn't be surprised. She's only done a few films, though she is famousÃÂas an MMA and Muay Thai fighter!! And, as you'd expect from a woman with such training, her skills are INSANELY good. Heck, she seems tougher and more capable than all the male action stars of the genreÃ¢ÂÂand she makes it all look so real! By comparison, films by Van Damme and Steven Seagal look like kids' films!!! I also love Carano because although she is pretty, she's NOT the Hollywood type. She has real curves and looks like she's NOT the product of plastic surgery and bulimia!!The film is set on some fictional Spanish-speaking Caribbean nation or, perhaps, they intend it to be the Dominican Republic (there are three Spanish-speaking countries in the CaribbeanÃ¢ÂÂand it's not Cuba and they said it wasn't Puerto Rico in the movie*)Ã¢ÂÂthey never say. Regardless, the place is corruptÃÂvery, very, very corrupt. It's so corrupt that when an American tourist is kidnapped (or possibly killed), those responsible for it pay EVERYONE to pretend it never happenedÃ¢ÂÂeven the cops! So, this leaves Ana (Carano) all alone in a hostile country where practically no one seems able or willing to help. The neat thing about the film is that it is wonderful at misdirection. It's a very smart film as again and again I was surprised by who was behind all this and why. And, how it all ends is simply impossible to anticipate**.Overall, this is a super-high action film with an amazing heroineÃ¢ÂÂone that doesn't stand around waiting to be saved by a manÃ¢ÂÂand I love that. Carano plays the real thingÃ¢ÂÂand action hero in every sense of the wordÃ¢ÂÂ and a darn scary one!!So do I recommend the film? Well, I don't know. Its violence level is off the charts and it's certainly NOT a film for the kids, your mother or Father Flannigan! Plus, even if you THINK you like action films, you might just find this one too intense, bloody and violent. Often, Ana killsÃ¢ÂÂmuch like Sonny Chiba did in his Street Fighter films. But aside from the violence, it's an exceptional film all around. Heck, even NOW after the movie's been over for some time, my heart is STILL poundingÃÂ it's that intense and that well made.*They said the film is NOT set in Puerto Rico and talked about how they can escape to the nearby island of Puerto Rico. But, in reality, the film was actually made in Puerto Rico. I don't know what this will do for tourism!**If you SERIOUSLY anticipated all the twists, turns and surprises in this film, drop me a line.

Seven people and a drifter named Braker are trapped inside a old church/ new motel while the super cool COLLECTER (Billy Zane, in a role that was meant for him) and his group of nipple pierced, glow in the dark green eyes, cloven hooved, goatee sporting, slimy demons trick and mangle the cast in order to get a ""relic"" key that hold the power of darkness from taking over the world.Ernest Dickerson does well in the directing seat. The horror,comedy, and drama all combined nicely and never went over with the drama or comedy. None of it felt forced. As for the characters, I really warmed up to them (even the asshole Roach), all of the actors brought a little something special to their rather thin roles. I'll always remember the sad prostitute Cordelia, the no bulls*** Irene, or the funny ""need a drink"" hobo Uncle Willie. THE COLLECTOR is the main highlight of this movie. Excellent delivery by Zane. The man is too cool for TITANIC. I loved the way he persuaded some of the residents into selling there soul, it was more then just having the demons come in. The idea of the blood in the key and being able to make barriers of not letting in the demons was pretty slick too. William Sadler and Jada Pinkett brought a lot of drama and humanity to the movie, they served their characters well. The gore is also kick ass and works well (all about that arm getting ripped off, and hand punching through a face) and the demons looked pretty sickMy only complaint is the whole shooting the demons in the eyes to kill them was kinda blah, but Billy Zane has fun with even that (""I SHOULD KNOW, WHO MAKES UP ALL THESE RULES""). This is one cool movie, stands on its own two feet and pays respect to a lot of past horror movies, any true HORROR fan will appreciate THIS.

Then in a clever scene, there is a Col. Blimp- style swimming scene.We are introduced to Vera Brittain, living in provincial comfort in Buxton Derbyshire, and struggling against social convention. She and her young male friends, all on the threshold of adulthood, are looking to the future. It is the summer of 1914 and the era is caught well and authentically.Love is in the air and as our story develops we get some nice Michael Corleone-style 'Sicilian' courting. In a small part, Joanne Scanlan plays the chaperon Aunt Belle. She delivers to the part the same depth that she did when playing Mrs Catherine Dickens in last year's 'The Invisible Woman'. Played initially for laughs, the chaperon takes a much deeper and more human role as Summer moves into Autumn. There is a station scene, much more dramatic than that in the recent 'The Imitation Game', because the trains are going in a different direction.Vera Brittain herself wrote of critics who doubted the authenticity of her account. Who are we, to measure the authenticity and depth of feeling of young lovers? This was their love, not ours! The reality of WWI, of course, can be easily measured and recounted.The film gets progressively darker as the war intrudes into the story. The darkest scenes of all are set in France. These scenes are grim and gritty, muddy and bloody. There are many poignant scenes of love and war. Vera Brittain's male companions are played well by a strong cast. The central character of Roland Leighton is well played by Kit Harington, Here however, his romantic side is much more subdued, than that in his role in last year's 'Pompeii', where he featured in what was arguably the most romantic kiss scene of all time. Appropriately, Colin Morgan who has previously played the role of Merlin, here adds some magic, in what is perhaps the most poignant scene in this film. Perhaps the most sinister-looking figure in the film, is the innocent-faced-looking telegram-boy, played by Xavier Atkins. A small but scary part.Pre-war Imperial Britain changed to the post-war era of Vera Brittain. The pre-war campaign for votes for women failed. The war forced women to do jobs previously done by men, to take up new roles and new responsibilities. Thus the post-war clamour for women's equality could no longer be ignored, and instead change started. The life and literature of Vera Brittain was an inspiration for the next generation, not the least being her daughter, the politician Shirley Williams. Vera Brittain's 'Testament' is now a recognized part of British culture and history. It is a long time since I read her book, but it seems to me that this film authentically captures the story in the book.WWI was a seminal event. It changed the lives of a generation. it was a dominant theme in thinking in the inter-war period. To understand positions taken before and during WWII, we need to understand the context in which these positions were adopted.In four short years British history was changed forever. So too for the world. This true story authentically captures the period and the resultant changes. 9/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAyOTI3OTgwMTdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDAwNzM2NDUx._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The Emperor plucks off his fake beard, the Empress walks around puffing on cigarettes and showing the middle finger. She bangs on the table and doesn't act imperial at all. That is not at all the nature of the true Empress ""Sisi"". She was rather shy, reserved and spoke very softly. If she wasn't happy with something, she just walked away or didn't go at all. The film is supposed to show the aging Empress who, at the age of 40, is no longer an ideal of beauty. At that time, however, it was still very popular and quite handsome. It was the time of the riding stays in England and Ireland where, as is well known, she had received great admiration from the local community - especially from Bay Middleton, one of the best riders.She was also physically and mentally fit. The director of that film Marie Kreutzer says: ""My aim was to tell a story within the facts that could have been like this."" A resounding no! As she shows the Empress she definitely wasn't and she couldn't have been like that either. The Empress didn't smoke! It all comes from mix-ups and rumours. None of her close contemporaries reported that she has smoked. On the contrary! Her niece Marie Wallersee-Larisch writes in her memoirs: ""And all four were sunk in huge leather armchairs. We were even allowed to smoke, with the exception of the Empress, of course"" (Empress Elisabeth and I). That was in 1884 in the Amstel Hotel in Zaandvort/Amsterdam.Also the equipment in the film is not suitable as well as the costumes. Recently, many want to depict and interpret Empress Elisabeth in a ""modern"" way, but that is a falsification of history. It's a shame about the amount of money this film cost - something better could have been done with it, which would be urgently needed today in order to meet the claim of the true Empress among the ""guild souls"". Almost 125 years after her death, it would be time to make sure of that with a good historically correct film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTBhZDIzYzMtYTg0Ni00NjJlLTk0NDItMTIxOTI1YTMyNzZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE1MzI2NzIz._V1_UY209_CR5,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The supporting cast all holds their own, from a radiant (and surprisingly voluptuous) Rosemary Clooney, to the astoundingly agile Vera Ellen, to Dean Jagger's Patton-like General Waverly...they all hit their marks very well. The plot-line is unbelievable.  Who cares?  This is a feel-good Christmas Movie, for cryin' out loud!  The production numbers are sheer fun, the plot doesn't get in the way of all the beauty and great music, the actors are obviously having a good time, and we're all allowed to window-peep on the shenanigans.  This is the PERFECT movie to put on after Macy's Parade, while all those who don't like football are helping prep for the big Turkey Day meal.  You sneak a bit of dressing or cranberry sauce, and watch a production number.  The plot is so user-friendly, missing five minutes here and there doesn't hurt. Treat yourself.

D.A.R.Y.L has very nice cinematography, colourful sets and costumes without being too fancy and good special effects, while the soundtrack is cool. I liked the script too, it was funny and heart-warming and the story was engaging and poignant as well as briskly paced. The direction I had no problem with either, while the acting is fine especially with Barrett Oliver who is simply wonderful in the lead.

As the story unfolds, the tension mounts as does the fear and dread. The horror is amplified by the constant reminder that everything presented here could actually happen or has happened.

Summing up The Diary of a Wimpy Kid, The Long haul = Predictable dialogue, predictable action, predictable repetitive jokes from the past, a lousy no-chemistry cast, and profoundly boring. The fact that everyone in the cast comes off as ""acting"" is just another nail in the coffin.About 98% of the reviews on Long Haul point out how bad the movie is. Variety and Hollywood Reporter gave it some kudos. Which shows that a big studio, like Fox, can still ""Pay Off"" reviewers in an attempt at not making the film a ""total bust"", which it is. You had an iconic cast in the first 3 movies that were excellent. The original cast had charm, chemistry, great interaction, and made 3 very entertaining movies based upon Jeff Kinney's Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. This movie, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, the Long Haul, just doesn't connect at all. The Long Haul film is sort of like a stand alone idea created in an attempt to ""con"" the public into thinking this is a continuation of the original three movies. It is nothing of the kind. The movie is so bad on all accounts that 20th Century Fox had to go out and try and get the original cast members to say something nice about the movie. But that just came off as a ""cheap hustle"". The story and performances are not funny. This movie reeks of predictable action and dialogue, as well as a cast that are, simply put - just bad, without cohesiveness or chemistry. Our 4 kids, my wife and I really enjoyed the first 3 Wimpy Kid movies and we watch them over again, to this day. I don't think anyone could ever take the place of Zachary Gordon as Greg Heffley, even though a very weak attempt was tried. Gordon ""was"" Heffley and performed masterfully as the main character and kept true to the personality of Kinney's book series character. In the Wimpy Kid, Long Haul, the part of Rowley, which was so prominent in the first 3 movies and in Kinney's book series, has been completely downplayed to almost non-existence, with little screen time. Let's not even talk about the actor who they chose to play Rowley - what an amateur and not believable in any way.The actor who plays Rodrick came out of ""left field"" and is a farce in that he doesn't fit the character of Roderick both in physiology and performance. He doesn't match the characterization as written by Jeff Kinney. Devon Bostick (the original Rodrick) could surely have played the part since Hollywood uses 25-35 year-old's to play Jr. High and High School kids anyway. In addition, attempting to replace Rachel Harris and Steve Zahn with Barrymore and Tom-Everet makes it all an underwhelming, futile attempt at movie making.This is a movie that should never have been made. The original movies were fun and entertaining. Wimpy Kid, Long Haul is an empty attempt to make money as an ""after-thought"" and rip off the public because Fox was too stupid to make 6 back-to-back Wimpy movies, which they could have done, when they had the opportunity. Apparently, 20th Century Fox is not a pro-active or foresightful studio as, for example, Warner Brothers or Universal would have been. Ie: Warner Bros shot Harry Potter movies back to back. Fox could have easily made 6 Wimpy Kid series movies from the original cast long before they matured and everyone would have been happy.Don't waste your time or money on this poor attempt at resurrecting the Wimpy Kid movie world. If the studio had 1/2 a brain, they would have made this an Animation Film instead, which might have garnered some interest from the fans.Find something else to do with your own time or kids this weekend as sitting through the Wimpy Kid, Long Haul is just that - a boring long haul.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMjc3NjExMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIwNDU1MTI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Tsk, tsk, tsk! First of all, how can anyone pick up a video with this sort of picture of Chevy Chase on the front and expect it to not be stupid--in the best possible sense! Indeed, I admit, the movie is stupid, but that is wholly what I love about it. Sure, if you want a more realistic mystery story, watch the first one. But for purely enjoying Chevy Chase's ridiculous antics, this one surpasses it. Though I can't imagine any other actor who could have pulled this script off and made it anything worthwhile! I generally end up watching this movie at least every few months and have yet to grow tired of it. And yet I have only recently added the first movie to my private collection.Chevy Chase is one of the best out-and-out comedy actors available in my opinion. And you can't expect him to be serious in a movie that was intended to be anything but.I think the best part about Chevy Chase as Fletch, is that he lives out those crazy ideas we sometimes get (such as convincing someone of invisible squealing bugs, simply telling someone their house is on fire, and marching into a corporation like you own the place), and he gets away with it when most of us don't dare in the first place. Perhaps the people who can't enjoy him simply don't get the same temptations, and therefore can't see why he appeals to those of us who have to repress the desire to introduce yourself as a famous sixteenth-century astrologer.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1YmE1MTAtY2VhMS00ZDZmLTg0MWMtY2MxNjRmMzU1ZjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This film has precisely what black audiences say they are looking for - depth, real characters with a number of real layers....and yet people say they cannot get into this film.  I say watch it and simply feel the messages being conveyed through the hearts of the characters.  Tupac Shakur's performance saddens my heart....because he had so much potential as an actor as proven with his performance here.  I was fortunate enough to actually meet and compliment him on this performance, which is at turns skillful and all his own.  He had that quality that film actors envy in that the camera loved him.

We see a connection between a mentally ill father and his lovingly adorable daughter. A really close one. Although mentally unfit, the emotion and love of the father is undeniable. And then you have a smart and understanding daughter, who loves his father so much and doesn't see her father differently. Behind that, there is a tragically engaging story -- The kind-hearted father, as innocent as he is, accused of murder and rape. The prison scenes act as an icing to the story. A place so feared and somber, is in fact where most of the comedy takes place. It shows the positive side of a prison life, and that not all prisoners are gangsters or bad. Everyone has a heart, a good one that is. They have made their prison cell a very bearable place. So much that even Ye-Seung, the daughter can hide in it and stay with them.All characters play very important roles to construct the whole movie. It's fun to watch the prison inmates, all having their very own personality. Ryoo Seung-Yong portrayed the character of the mentally handicapped father very convincingly. And the child actor, Kal So-Won is so cute and sweet and suited her role so much. Even the adult version of the girl turns out to be a real sweetheart and has a very captivating performance. The movie shows us that you can be someone as high up as a Police Commissioner, but a disgusting personality. Or someone as simple-minded as the father in this story, but with a good heart. Rankings and positions really does not determine a person. Sometimes things are more delightful when it's not complicated, as long as we know to appreciate and cherish all that we have.This is definitely one of the best Korean movies. Filled with tears and laughters. Yes, you have to prepare some tissues as it gets very teary- eyed towards the end.. and not just once.

The choices weren't always clear either.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: The mechanical contraption that the former physicists built looks ridiculous.The film completely glosses over the daughter's reaction to how her father is now alive. How is it determined who will have memories and who will not? There are some plot holes like that, so try not to overthink the story too much.The film moves quite slowly.I didn't feel a lot of chemistry between the leading couple.There was a rumor that this film is related to the Cloverfield franchise, but it's not.TIPS FOR PARENTS: Young kids will be very bored.Profanity and F-bombs Talk of a drunk driver who killed a man Some alcohol and cigarettes People talk about killing other people.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWJhYTYzNjAtZWQxNS00MTVhLWIzNDQtOWIyMjc3ZjliYTQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM1NjM2ODg1._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I have no doubt that she would be more than capable of portraying the complexities of a woman like Stella Goldschlag, to the point where, while not accepting the decisions she made, one might at least be able to understand the reasons that she made them. That belief remains true, but sadly, Kilian Riedhof's film is not her chance. While technically capable, and with superior attention to period detail, ""Stella: A Life"" - particularly in its last two thirds - fails in the prime area of narrative cinema: ""Storytelling"". Indicators of Stella's motivations are lost in what becomes a frustrating series of virtual jump cuts, and the audience is left to fill in the gaps to try and understand what has not been shown. The protagonist's evolution from ""victim"" to ""villain"" seems to have been left in the cutting room floor, and all that remains of Beer's performance is a slide show, rather than a fully developed characterisation. It is disappointing to see this wasted opportunity discuss a (still) largely unexamined aspect of such a pivotal epoch of social history.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk0NjEyYWUtMmJmYS00ODlhLWI5YmMtN2I1YTMzZTg3N2NlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDU5MDEyMA@@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Dershowitz, who loves being in the limelight almost as much as he loves the law, took on the task of saving Claus Von Bulow from prison for the attempted murder of his rich wife initially as a means of raising money to help him in his pro bono cases. The rather heavy-handed manner in which we are advised of this should not detract from Dershowitz's work. The irony is that as the case developed Dershowitz became persuaded that Claus was innocent.Whether Dershowitz convinced himself of Von Bulow's innocence to assuage a possibly guilty conscience is a good question. Remember Dershowitz is the guy who said after the O.J. Simpson trial (he was one of Simpson's lawyers) that he didn't know whether Simpson was guilty or not. While that may be a good stance for a defense attorney, it is an insincere one for the public figure that Dershowitz has become.Starring as Dershowitz is Ron Silver in an uneven performance that at times made me think of Gabe Kaplan doing a young and uncomedic Groucho Marx. I wonder if Dershowitz was entirely flattered. Director Barbet Schroeder (Barfly 1987; Single White Female 1992) uses several points of view to tell the story, including a voice-over from Glenn Close's Sunny Von Bulow as she lies comatose, but also from recollections by Jeremy Irons' Claus Von Bulow. We see some scenes twice, colored by the differing points of view. This technique is entirely appropriate since what really happened is far from clear to this day. It is Claus Von Bulow's fortune that was reversed. Whether the first two juries or the third were right is something Schroeder leaves for the audience to determine.But make no mistake about it: the heart of the movie is Jeremy Irons' Oscar-winning performance. His subtle artistry based on a deep conception (true to life or not) of the aristocratic and Germanic Claus allowed him to create a persona that is cold and aloft, yet somehow sympathetic. The contrast with Silver's Brooklyn-born hyper-energetic Dershowitz made for some good cinematic chemistry, although sometimes it came across like nice Jewish boy defends a vampire.Glenn Close's flawless rendition of the idle, drug-befouled Sunny reminds us once again that she is a great actress. Unfortunately I don't think Schroeder spent as much time and energy as he should have with the people who played Dershowitz's law students. They seemed amateurish and unconvincing in just about every scene. And there were too many of them--law students, that is. Some distillation of intent, and more directorial guidance might have helped.Nicholas Kazan's script has a number of good lines in it, not the least of which is this: Dershowitz: ""You are a very strange man."" Claus Von Bulow: ""You have no idea."" Also nice was Von Bulow's observation after they are seated in the restaurant and after the waiter has called him ""Doctor"" Von Bulow: ""When I was married to Sunny, we never got this table. Now, two injections of insulin and I'm a doctor."" Indeed it is partly Kazan's snappy, comedic and self-revelatory lines that humanize Claus Von Bulow's character and persuade us that he could very well be innocent.While I like Dershowitz's self-serving style and his confidence, what I admire most about the man is his realistic conception of the defense attorney's role in our society and his idea of what makes a good lawyer; that is, a good lawyer is one who recognizes not only that every person deserves the best defense their resources allow, but that he himself deserves to defend those with the best resources.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

When a cruise ship arrives carrying a priceless diamond, the chase begins anew.After the Sunset is a pretty ordinary movie with some entertaining moments and a lot of gorgeous scenery. It won't challenge the viewer at all but it will offer a pretty enjoyable ride. The premise is fairly simple and it is nothing really new. Brett Ratner keeps things easy and safe as he moves the film at a nice pace. The opening scene is pretty funny and nicely done. The middle is also pretty good yet a little dull while the ending is just plain disappointing. I was expecting a nice payoff but the ending was so simple. This didn't ruin the movie but it doesn't warrant a viewing either.The acting is pretty good and there are a few characters that keep the film interesting. Pierce Brosnan stars as Max and he gives a good performance. He sometimes looked a little tired but he usually seemed to be having fun. Woody Harrelson is great as the FBI agent and he looks to be having a great time. Salma Hayek offers great eye candy and a decent performance. She doesn't really do anything special except look very beautiful. Don Cheadle gives an okay performance though he doesn't get a lot of screen time.There are a few reasons why After the Sunset would make for a good rental. First, the scenery looks great and eye candy never hurts. Second, the chemistry between Brosnan and Harrelson is surprisingly good and it is fun to watch them on screen. Third, those looking for some escapist fun should find it with this film. Last but not least, Salma Hayek looks amazing. I would have preferred a little more substance but the movie proved to be entertaining. In the end, After the Sunset isn't worth checking out in theaters but it could make for a decent rental.

She captured both the immensity of the Houston skyline and the charm of the small town dancehall.

I really did...","Let me preface this by saying I have never seen 50 Shades of Grey. I've seen the reviews, I know the story, but after seeing 50 Shades of Black I feel like I've seen the actual movie it was parodying. Wayans' comedies have devolved from clever self-aware satires to blatant movie rip-offs with sporadic laughs. The difference is, unlike the Haunted House movies, there are next to no laughs in 50 Shades of Black. It's essentially deconstructing every scene in 50 Shades of Grey to show the audience how dumb it is, which would be fine if it was actually funny. But no, this humor is scraped right from the bottom of the barrel, reusing the same stupid gags from previous spoofs and rehashed awkward shock ""humor"" that comes across more cringe-worthy than anything.I like Marlon Wayans, I really do. He seems like an awesome guy and he was actually a great writer one point, and a great actor too (to this day I'm blown away by his performance in Requiem for a Dream), but his talents must have gone to his head because he isn't tapping into his genius anymore. It's just easy joke after easy joke, and as simple as the jokes are, none of them land. In fact, at one point after a painfully awkward dinner scene that went on 5 minutes too long, I couldn't help but laugh, for the wrong reasons mind you, thinking, ""Jesus Christ, this is a real movie?"" It was painful. All of me wanted this movie to be good, but part of me knew it would be a disaster. Well, that part of me was right. Sure, I chuckled at a few scenes, but I also chuckled a few times in A Haunted House 2 and that's still a terrible movie. The difference is 50 Shades of Grey is even lazier and somehow even less clever than AHH2. I anxiously await the day the Wayans brothers come out with another great spoof movie, but I have a feeling it's going to be a long, long wait.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MTg3MzY4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI4MzM1NzE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In my opinion, this is one of the best of this type of horror movie i've seen. It's right up there with Peter Jackson's early work and Evil Dead. All the negative things the other reviewer was saying, the poor dialogue, and acting, the unrealistic effects, were deliberate, after all, the effects were done by highly skilled and trained effects people at WETA Workshops - who of course did Lord of The Rings. It is a horror comedy packed with clichÃÂ©s and subtle allusions, and full of New Zealand humour, which i concede probably doesn't translate well internationally. NZ is primarily a farming nation, we're a huge exporter of lamb, Farming is a huge part of our culture, and this blends that with our history of offbeat, slightly dark, and idiosyncratic cinema. It is a clever, quintessentially kiwi, homage to such previously mentioned horror comedies (or comedic horrors). That's what i like about it, it is a lot cleverer than it looks. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the film. If you like Peter Jackson's early stuff, you'll like this.

Feels like one screenplay from every genre was shredded and randomly pieced together.The story lacked continuity, cohesion and most of the attempt at humor was infantile. Even some of the dialog was questionable. Writer and director Dong-hoon Choi failed in giving us a story that made much sense, and instead convoluted almost two and a half hours of story-telling with ridiculous timelines that were riddled with plot and technical issues, and lazy filler with very little substance to the story.I could edit/cut this down to a 90 min film and even give it a proper ending, and I'd enjoy it more, and I'm not a filmmaker. If it wasn't for the amazing visual effects and decent performances, I would've turned this off after the first time-line jump. I lost interest during every change in timeline because the story kept getting sloppier and lazier.What's worse, is that after the long dragged out 142 min runtime, there was no reward in the end; we'll probably have to sit through another convoluted 142 mins mess of a story in Part 2, and I'm not willing to make that investment.

If you've seen a lot of disturbing movies, you know exactly what I'm talking about. You'll get the idea after one viewing, and you won't be able to wipe some of the images out of your head, or still have nightmares about them, even years later anyway.I heard about this movie in the 80's, when I went out of my way to see every movie or video I could that was supposed to be shocking, disturbing, or really sick. Actually, I still do that, though these days I do try to read about it first, to make sure it is worth spending my money on. So that probably means I need some sort of therapy, but that's beside the point. Many of my favorite horror authors had brought up the movie when asked about the most upsetting movies they'd seen, and someone I talked to who had seen it just shook their head grimly when I asked them about it. I looked everywhere for this movie but couldn't find it.  Years after I'd given up I found a bootleg copy from the laser-disc. This was after I'd seen Peter Jackson's ""Braindead"" uncut at a film festival, and pretty much decided I'd seen it all and couldn't be shocked anymore.This movie is evidently based on real-life events during WWII, about a medical camp referred only to as ""Camp 731"" where the Japanese perform really nasty and unusually creative medical experiments on the Chinese prisoners. This includes women, children, and, in the one scene you couldn't pay me enough to watch because it was rumored to be real and I didn't want to even see a fake depiction of it, a cat.  I'd heard that it made Ilsa's SS Camp look like a day at the beach. Well, I don't know about that, but this is definitely one of the most disturbing and depressing movies I've ever seen- as the guy I bought it from said, ""Guaranteed to ruin your day"". Fortunately, my day was already pretty much ruined, as I was home sick with the flu and feeling wretched the day I watched it. I probably would have been able to fall asleep way earlier if I hadn't watched it, though.This is definitely not an enjoyable movie, or fun to sit through. Any Italian cannibal movie I can think of is more upbeat than this. Even if you were one of the people who thought the un-cut Ilsa was 'campy' and 'fun', I don't think you'll be too cheerful during this. I'd actually heard about what were supposed to be the most upsetting scenes, like the poor man in the decompression experiment that sort of implodes in a horrible way that I think is safe to say has never been filmed before or since, when all the air is sucked out of the room, and the very graphic autopsy of the one character in the movie that the filmmakers go out of their way to make sure you care about. Man, that was cold-blooded, but I was expecting that. There's one experiment, though, I think it was called the ""frostbite experiment"" (most of the experiments are preceded by a title card, which gives the movie an even more cold-blooded, documentary feel) that caught me totally off-guard. I don't want to ""spoil"" it if you're really into getting caught off guard, but it was one of the rare times I was so shocked when watching a movie I actually gasped and cursed out loud when I was watching something by myself. It takes a lot to shock me, but whenever I'm talking with someone about scenes in movies that really disturbed us, this is one of the first ones I think of. It's been over 5 years since I saw that scene but I still remember it waaay too vividly. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your point of view) some of the newer DVDs I've seen for sale give it away in the cover art, so don't look too closely at the box before you watch it (unless you want to know what you're getting yourself into before you rent it). I've got to hand it to whoever thought up that one, because I did NOT see it coming. If you're into non-stop over-the-top gore, then you might get bored during parts of this. The filmmakers spend some time making you feel sorry for the characters in other ways. This film is well-made, well-acted, has very realistic (way too realistic) gore, and nothing is ever played for laughs - it's not a low-budget splatter movie.The entire movie is just completely depressing, downbeat, and disturbing to the very last frame, and I really only recommend it to people I know who are pretty jaded and don't mind really disturbing, upsetting movies, or those (like me, I hate to admit) that want to say they've seen it all. You also might want to recommend it to any smug people you know that brag about how nothing makes them sick.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2M5NmNjMTAtOTMwZi00OGE2LWI5M2QtMDg3NDE2OTU5NjJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIwNDY4NDI@._V1_UY209_CR34,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Black Dog is Patrick Swayze's best underrated highway speed action movie that was released before The Fast and the Furious come out, it is an action film of the late 90's that I will always cherish and love to death. This movie is very underrated solid action film. I love it to death. I have this movie on Blu-ray the same Patrick Swayze movie I have on Blu-ray are Steel Dawn, Road House and this film, they are all in my collection, but I don't have Uncommon Valor because that film was never released on Blu-ray, I am still waiting on the release. Black Dog is a 1998 action film directed by Kevin Hooks and starring Patrick Swayze. The film tells the story of a trucker and ex-con who is manipulated into transporting illegal arms. The film co-stars musicians Randy Travis and Meat Loaf.R.I.P. - Patrick Swayze (1952 - 2009) I really miss you so much and I wish you could do more bad ass action movies, I am your biggest fan and so was my mom we all miss you and we all love you, I love you to death!

This is the tale of Father Merrin's initial battle with Pazuzu and the rediscovery of his faith.","270","Maybe the worst of the year","Number one on Entertainment Weekly's list of the scariest movies of all time. Number 196 of the top 250 movies as rated by fans on the IMDb.com database. Number one R-rated film of all-time if adjusted for inflation. Banned in several countries including the United Kingdom. Possibly the scariest and most controversial film ever made. The movie was The Exorcist, the horror film about a possessed child that took the world by storm in 1973. Those of us lucky enough to see the film in a packed theatre or to have lived through its release will never forget the experience. News about paramedics being on hand in major cities to handle the panic stricken and reports of people fainting in theaters were rampant. Religious leaders like Billy Graham condemned the film claiming the movie itself to be possessed by the devil and there were rumors of a curse put upon the production crew that grew increasingly elaborate with every broken telephone connection.All the hype and hysteria lead to buckets and buckets of cash for the Warner Bros. Studio and then two inferior sequels (which seem to be the right of passage for a film in this genre). Restored in 2003, director William Friedkin added some 'never-before-seen' footage and re-released The Exorcist theatrically. Its second run scared up another $40 million to add to its already impressive cume. So based on a franchise that fizzled out with the third installment in 1990 only to be resurrected with the 30-year anniversary DVD edition of the original, Hollywood has decided to go back and try and breathe new life into the series by telling the story of Father Merrin before he encountered the possessed Regan MacNeil in the apt titled Exorcist: The Beginning.Going backwards in time is usually easier for filmmakers as they don't have to deal with leftover character explanations or story plots that still needed resolve. But this was the least of the films production problems. First were the revolving door of directors attached to the project including John Frankenheimer who stepped down from the production eerily just before his death. Then Paul Schrader (Auto Focus) came on board and shot an entire film. Studio executives were however unimpressed with the lack of scares and gore and greenlit the film to be re-made again under the helm of Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger). Harlin re-shot the entire film incorporating only a few scenes from the original Schrader version. The next obstacle was with the availability of the actors for a second full shooting schedule. When Gabriel Mann was unable to reprise his role due to a scheduling conflict, another actor, namely James Darcy from Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World was brought on board to replace him. Other actors and actresses and additional story lines were added to help shape Harlin's new vision and voila,ÃÂtwo versions of a film to make the perfect 2-sided DVD (Like that will ever happen!).Whether Schrader's version will ever see the light of day is unknown and that is too bad, for in the interim, we are left with a shell of a film that is so misguided and uninteresting, it made Scary Movie look like an Oscar contender. For those of you who caution to comment that no film could ever live up to the original, I argue that this movie stands on its own to being the worst of in the series and maybe even one of the worst films of 2004.Exorcist: The Beginning centers on the Father Merrin character. Here, he is not far removed from the brutality he witnessed during World War II and his faith has severely waned. While aimlessly drifting through Egypt, Merrin is contracted to help in the excavation of a church that has been uncovered as part of an archaeological dig in Kenya. As their desecration begins, an evil is unleashed unto the land with unspeakable force. How much force you ask? Well, enough force to cause the MPAA of slapping a NC-17 rating on the film unless specific cuts were made. As Merrin continues his research strange things begin to happen to the village. Tribesmen fall into uncontrollable seizures, hyenas begin lurking amongst the workers and after a young boy is torn apart, his younger brother seems to be in a state reminiscent of Regan MacNeil. While the everyone from the Vatican to the British Army tries to interfere with the progress or the information being released as part of the dig, Merrin and the local doctor (Izabella Scorpuco) defy the warning signs of evil as they try to put the pieces of the churches puzzle together. For a movie that is suppose to scare the pants off us, I didn't even feel a tug at my zipper. I was actually surprised at the lack of scares and how the film tried to resort to the usual tricks to try and induce jumps. Clocks that stop ticking, crosses that turn upside down when you're not looking and doors that open and close on their own have all been done before and wouldn't scare even my young nephew despite the fact that with each attempt they blast a sound bit so loud that it's obvious that they felt they needed the help. Also crippling the films credibility were the below average special effects. The hyenas were so CGI as to be distracting and the possessed individual in the final chapter comes after Father Merrin like something out of the Evil Dead series. In maybe the most ridiculous scene in the film, dead butterflies stuck to a hobby board begin fluttering. Scary indeed.Maybe the filmmakers should have taken a look at the history of church related mysteries in the past five years. The Order and Stigmata proved that people are no longer interested in seeing religiously overtoned thrillers. Maybe the real horrors of war and its atrocities being broadcast over our breakfast tables have us more grounded in present day repugnance. It would not be fair to bark at the acting in Exorcist: The Beginning simply because Stellan SkarsgÃÂ¥rd and company have so little to work with, they don't seem to be interested in their roles and let's face it ÃÂ it's hard to take the bull by the horns when the bull is a donkey. For all my bitching and complaining, I will give this stinker a ÃÂ½ star. I did like the opening that had a wide angled shot that takes place after a war leaving thousands dead or dying on the battleground, and I will admit to not seeing the twist at the end of the film even if it was for lack of interest. But ÃÂ½ star or no stars, my hopes is that people read this review and spare themselves the wallet ravaging to give this dog the box office it deserves.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NzY1MzQ0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM1MTEzMw@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The Spanish Civil War is nearing its bloody end. Ten year old Carlos, the orphaned son of a slain Republican, is left by his tutor at an isolated orphanage for boys. The school is destitute, barely able to provide enough food for the children, but headmistress Carmen and Dr. Casares do the best they can. Carlos accepts his fate bravely, but there are still school bullies to contend with, an unexploded bomb sitting in the courtyard as a constant reminder of the war which still rages, and an abusive caretaker named Jacinto who has his own secret agenda. As if that were not enough, a ghost begins stalking Carlos, the ghost of a boy named Santi whose demise is shrouded in mystery and who solemnly warns Carlos that many will soon die. As the war begins closing in on the orphanage, violence erupts within and Santi's prediction comes sadly true. But the worst has not yet happened. The abandoned boys must band together if they hope to survive, and the dead will aid their cause if they are to be avenged.This is a beautiful movie, absolutely gorgeous from start to finish. The dusty, isolated landscape is a ghost itself and the constant threat of violence - from the war, to the bullies and, of course, from the traitorous Jacinto - gives this film an unrelenting atmosphere of tension and dread. The acting is superb, from the children as well as the adults. Federico Luppi as Dr. Casares is superb, providing us with a true hero, a gentleman of class and compassion. Eduardo Noriega is perfectly cast as the despicable Jacinto, making you despise him more and more as the film progresses. This is not just a ghost story, though the figure of Santi is central and key to everything that happens. It is a tale of love and honor as well as horror and ruin. It is a coming of age story and an adult drama. It also manages to be scary as hell when it wants to be.Guillermo del Toro has made a masterpiece with ""The Devils Backbone.""

An arthouse masterpiece.","The first thing to state about this beautiful movie is that it's monochrome. So stunningly so that at times you feel you are in a photographic gallery rather than a cinema. The quality of the cinematography is quite extraordinary thanks to Lucas Zal.It's also in 4:3 format. Not the square format of Instagram, but close.We don't see 4:3 very often these days but Wes Anderson used it to immense effect in Grand Budapest Hotel and so did Lazslo Melis in Son of Saul.It's an engaging format that draws you in. It suggests a time before cinemascope (16:9 etc) and only really works in period cinema of a time. This time. But it also lends itself to incredible framing, such as when our female protagonist floats down a river gradually disappearing out of shot, and later in the movie when the chief protagonists leave a bus and walk out of frame in a composition that Henri Cartier Breson would be proud of.It's one of the most beautiful movies I've seen in many years.In truth that's probably its biggest strength.It is, but it isn't really, narrative driven. More episodic than story driven but it does tell a tale about director Pawel Pawlikowski's parents' love affair set against the Cold War backdrop in his native Poland.It's fairly sordid in a way (his mother was abused by her father as a child) but without anything shocking to see.Imagine, yes.The two leads ( Joanna Kulig and Tomasz Kot) are magnificent. Brooding, beautiful (although unconventionally so) and real.Lucas Zal has a great time dwelling on three particular things. Crowd shots. Amazing, Dance sequences. Amazing. Joanna Kulig (the lead). Amazing.In particular, Joanna Kulig has a stand out performance. She's not one to show her enjoyment in life. Sullen most would say. But it is an immense performance.It's a love story, set against the challenges that Cold War Poland put in front of people of artistic belief where communist doctrine made creativity very difficult.What Pawel Pawlikowski achieves is a mood piece of exemplary, peerless really, detail.And it's a musical. I was constantly drawn to comparing it to La La Land, yet it is so NOT La La Land. Partly it's down to Kulig who shares the unorthodox looks (beauty) of Emma Stone. Partly it's the framing of Zal.And the music fuses from Polish country folk to French basement jazz (which La La Land would have been so comfortable with).This is an Oscar nomination shoe in. It's absolutely brilliant.And, at 88 minutes, certainly does not outstay its welcome.Bravo!A Straight 10 from me.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJmNzExOGItZTQyMi00YzBlLTk0ZTQtNzAxYmUwZDQwZjU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE1MjMyNzI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The cast clearly had chances to improvise a large portion of the films dialogue and situations but barely any of the films payoffs actually work and at the end of the day most of the material here is below the performers talents.Looking to strike that cord between festive joy and raunchy comedy gold, Office Christmas Party ends up failing to find a winning balance in either denominator and with a collection of recycled jokes and confused stars, this is the worst kind of party where no one seems to be having fun other than the ones that organised the whole shebang.ÃÂ½ a Kia out of 5","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzgyZjE1MjUtYjFjZS00NzMzLWFmNWMtMDJjNGY0ZTgwYjc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMjk0NjI@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In the original parable, two women each claim that a baby is hers. King Solomon says he'll settle the matter by cutting the baby in half; one woman stops him, saying that the other can have the baby. Solomon gives the baby to the woman who has offered to relinquish it, on the basis that she loves the baby more than the other, so she must be the real mother. But in Brecht's version it is the false mother who relinquishes, and is therefore given, the baby. Brecht draws the Marxist moral from the story that things belong to those who love and use them best, regardless of legal ownership.Jon Amiel's beautiful and touching film, adapted from a French movie, makes much the same point - that the pretended Jack Sommersby (Richard Gere) deserves to be regarded as the true husband of Laurel (Jody Foster) because he loves her more than the legal one; deserves to be regarded as the owner of the Sommersby land because he works it better; and deserves Sommersby's name - whatever that brings - because he honours it more.  At a realistic level there are a few difficulties in translating the original Martin Guerre story from the Middle Ages to the post Civil War era, and parts of the courtroom sequence could have been more incisive; but these flaws are of little account, compared with the overall sweep of the film, both plot-wise, but especially visually. It achieves epic proportions at some points, and there are wide vistas of people working in the fields reminiscent of Terrence Mallick's Days of Heaven, which also starred Gere.  It seems to be the done thing on these postings to sneer at Gere's acting; I've no idea why. Time after time, in a wide range of parts and films - from Yanks and An Officer and a Gentleman to Internal Affairs and Pretty Woman - he delivers professional and sensitive performances. Here again, his performance is impeccable; as is that of Jodie Foster, whose part calls for her to be restrained, especially when Sommersby first appears. (Incidentally, I couldn't care less whether there was any so-called chemistry between Gere and Foster; some film-goers should get it into their heads that couples on the screen are acting at making love, not engaging in the real activity.)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2M1ZGJkMTItM2QwYS00Nzg0LWE2NjMtNWY1NTg1YzRkNWFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMwMjk0MTQ@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The original was such a staple of my childhood, yet had such an incomplete ending, that I was intensely curious to see what they would do with another sequel. Besides, I knew that it could not possibly be worse than ""The NeverEnding Story II.""Boy, was I wrong.""The NeverEnding Story III"" has rightly earned its place among IMDb voters as the 79th worst movie of all time. It is so bad that, in writing this review, I risk making it sound like it's worth watching, sort of like ""Plan Nine from Outer Space."" I assure you, this film is in no way in the Ed Wood category of being so incompetently done that it becomes enjoyable to watch. Those moviegoers who take pleasure in seeing cinematic disasters should be forewarned about this one, lest they never again be able to erase from their memory Rockbiter's gravelly-voiced version of ""Born to be Wild,"" played in a video sequence early in the film and again during the end credits.No, I am not joking.The second film does have its admirers, and as much as I hated it, I sort of understand where they're coming from. At least that film had a legitimate purpose, to tell the second half of the novel which the first film had neglected to do. But now the story is finished, so the third film has to make up its own reason for being, with an even shabbier budget than that of the second film. So it concocts a story that allows us to see as little of Fantasia as possible. Here, a series of magical mishaps causes a bunch of creatures from Fantasia to be transported into the real world. These include Falkor the luck dragon, a baby rockbiter about the size of a fountain statue, and a talking tree. (Falkor, who must have gotten a lobotomy sometime between the second and third film, will chase after a ""dragon"" at a Chinese festival.) What we do see of Fantasia makes the place seem a lot smaller than I had ever imagined. Almost all of the scenes there take place in the empress's chamber in the Ivory Tower, though there is also one sequence where we get to see Rockbiter's home (just what I've always wanted to do!) with Mama Rockbiter and of course the previously mentioned Baby Rockbiter sitting in front of a large stone TV set. Needless to say, the inhabitants of Fantasia seem to possess quite a bit more knowledge of Earth than they did in the first film. When the gnome describes Bastian as ""not exactly Arnold Schwarzenegger in the muscle department,"" we're reminded how much more enjoyable the film would probably be if Schwarzenegger were actually in it.The cause of these events is that a gang of school bullies steals the book and discovers that it gives them the power to wreak havoc on the inhabitants of Fantasia. Strangely, these modern kids never seem surprised that magic exists. Think how long it took in the first film for even imaginative, ten-year-old Bastian to become convinced of the book's supernatural qualities. These bullies, much older and more concrete, never go through such a skeptical period. And later, when the Auryn falls into the hands of a teenage girl, she treats it with about the same level of awe as if she got hold of her parents' credit card.There are actually some familiar actors in this mess. Mr. Koreander is played by the British character actor Freddie Jones, Bastian is played by the kid from ""Free Willy,"" and the main bully is played by a relatively young Jack Black, who now probably would like to do with this film what George Lucas wants to do with the ""Star Wars Holiday Special.""","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2U0NDQxMDEtNzU1YS00ZjM2LTg3Y2QtZGRjMDAxMzBhODRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMzE4Mzg@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

When you consider the relatively young age of the actors, Daphne Zuniga was 22 and John Cusack was only 17, and it was only Rob Reiner's second film, it makes this film that much more of a milestone. Maybe the storyline is predictable, so what. The acting by Cusack and Zuniga is perfect. They make this movie seem real and honest.What makes this movie so enjoyable and memorable is the feelings it provokes. Remember the rush of emotions when you first meet someone who makes your heart beat out of your chest and feel lightheaded? Acting like you really don't like someone when deep down inside you would give anything to be with them? Going to a party and flirting with other people hoping that they would see you and get jealous? That's what this movie does for me. It makes me realize just how much I miss the innocence, passion and emotion of those days. The acting is wonderful and you really get drawn in to their plight as they make their way across the country to be with the one they ""think"" is their own ""sure thing"". The great thing about this movie is that every time it looks like they are finally going to get together, something pulls them apart.

This movie employed so many high school students and newbies! Screenplay was by the third guy from the left in Binghampton University's Screenwriting 101 class; visual effects from Miss Percey's Kindergarten Class of 2017, and military tactics was by the third cousin of the (in)famous Mall Ninja. (Google it.)This movie not only employed hundreds of amateur writers, actors and crew, it was an boon to the airsoft gun industry and cheap Chinese radio dealers in South America. Female casting was obviously done by Harvey Weinstein, as every female in the entire movie was either a pushy b**** or a large-breasted whore. It was also nice to see that the traditionally disadvantaged film workers like the blind could get a job in continuity and editing.Certainly, last time I attended USMC scout/sniper school, rule #1 was, as soon as the lens caps come off, randomly twirl the dials on your scope. Everyone knows a sniper can't hit anything until he/she randomly twirls a few dials.Yes, I'm being sarcastic. I can tolerate radio earpieces in upside down and highly-trained military and DEA agents with their stupid fingers in the trigger guards (that should NEVER happen) because ... well, it's a movie. But when the ""BEST sniper in the United States Marine Corp"" has his flashlight mounted on the TOP rail of his (fake) M4 carbine - effectively blocking his view of the sights - I turned it off.Dumb. Boring. Insulting to an audience who wants at least SOME semblance of reality. Just to illustrate how bad this movie is, even Billy Zane was so embarrassed to do this movie that he appeared only in brief cameos. And this is Billy Zane.

He clearly has survival training and is putting his knowledge to good use. He should be able to get help no problem, but despite all his efforts, it's the world that keeps tearing him down, not his ignorance as we see in so many other survival movies. We route for him and grieve when it doesn't go his way because we know he's doing absolutely everything by the book but it's just not going his way.

This time round, the crew are faced with a violation of the Prime Directive and whether or not the 600 people who live on a literal planet-of-youth are more important than the millions of other people that could benefit from the planet's regenerative powers. Action, drama, comedy and romance follow in true Star Trek spectacular.As always Patrick Stewart is in top form as Captain Picard who leads the Star Trek resistance to save the innocents from one of his own corrupt superiors Vice Admiral Dougherty (played terrifically by Anthony Zerbe) who are involved with some aliens (including F. Murray Abraham's Ad'har). Along the way Picard finds a new friend in Anij (played by the lovely Donna Murphy), one of the Ba'ku, and a little romance follows.Jonathan Frakes once again directs and does an outstanding job, though it does mean his character Commander Riker gets a bit less screen time, though he is always a pleasure to watch. Riker's relationship with Commander / Counsellor Deanna Troi heats up in this film (and it's about time too!) Marina Sirtis of course returns as the lovely Troi and gets a fairly good amount of screen time this time round, and certainly most of the comical moments. Frakes and Sirtis have great chemistry together.Brent Spinter's Data gets (as usual) too much screen time, again his story consists of his quest to become more human and the like, though he does befriend a Ba'ku child which was done quite well. As usual Gates McFadden (Dr. Beverly Crusher), Michael Dorn (Lt. Commander Worf) and LeVar Burton (Lt. Commander LaForge) are given very little to do in the Star Trek films, and this one is no exception, though at least Worf and LaForge got their own small story lines - Worf had to go through puberty again and LaForge found himself with the ability to see. Beverly however only gets a ""storyline"" involving her boobs firming up. Terrific. Poor Gates must be the most under-appreciated actress in all of Star Trek, but also the most gracious for returning each time.The special effects of ""Star Trek: Insurrection"" are above average, and the music score is really well done. Often its the small moments in the Next Generation films that are the best, and this one is no different, but at least the big moments are good too. I think the ""Star Trek the Next Generation"" films are probably the only action-type films in which the heroes are all (with the exception of Marina Sirtis) in their 50's and people still want to watch them. Quite interesting too that a main theme of the movie was the eternal youth. At least when the sad time comes that the Next Generation cast are no longer alive, they will be immortalised in history by their much loved characters and beautiful stories, just like ""Insurrection"".","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWEzZDI0NjEtY2FkMC00ZjQwLWI2YzgtZDEyMzMwZmRlZDlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Absurd. Ridiculous. Just plain stupid. These words usually serve to describe an incredibly awful movie that I try to forget forever and ever. However, some extremely rare pieces of absolutely crazy filmmaking are also characterized by the adjectives above, offering me the most entertaining time I can possibly ask for. An example of this case is Prisoners of the Ghostland. It's exceptionally dumb, follows a narrative completely devoid of any logic, and mixes up dozens of many genres by using different costumes, all sorts of epic scores, and character archetypes.Boasting an impressive production and set design (major Hollywood studios should be envious), Sion Sono offers the audience precisely what they expect from a film starring the maddest actor alive, Nicolas Cage. From the well-choreographed, well-edited, explosively bloody, hilarious action sequences to the infinite storylines, the viewers either accept whatever lunatic plot point or device the movie throws at the audience, or this is going to be a festival of pointing out what's wrong with the whole film. Prophecies, nuclear wars, zombies, samurais, cowboys... every generic development and formulaic characters we always see in every genre are present in this amalgam of pure chaos.As expected, Cage shines in another role that will probably generate thousands of new memes, but this time Sofia Boutella and Bill Moseley also deliver two captivating performances that kept me invested when Cage was out. The only problem I have with this type of movie is the balance of the whole craziness. I don't mind every single minute being packed with utterly ludicrous stuff, but when it starts getting genuinely confusing, that's when it becomes too much for me to handle. Nevertheless, as long as you keep your mind open and focus on the protagonist's main mission - and solely on that - you'll be able to enjoy this movie as much or more than I did.Prisoners of the Ghostland is everything a film starring Nicolas Cage is expected of being. Possessing technical attributes of making the biggest Hollywood studios shamelessly hide with envy, Sion Sono's movie is as illogical, absurd, ridiculous, stupid, and insanely entertaining as I hoped it would be. By mixing up dozens of distinct genres, the straightforward premise gets sucked into a world of total anarchy, where samurais, cowboys, nuclear explosions, modern cars, and much more collide to surround an otherwise simple narrative with nonsensically hilarious storylines and awesome action sequences. Sofia Boutella and Bill Moseley help Cage tackle this chaos, but the latter is the absolute standout due to his remarkable experience in crazy films. Despite it occasionally crossing the line and becoming too much for me to manage - it becomes seriously confusing - as long as the viewers are well-prepared to accept every jaw-dropping new development, fun is guaranteed with this brilliant satire.Rating: A-","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTE3YWU3MjYtYTAxYy00ODQ0LTg3MDQtMmNjMDU3MDRlNTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEyMjM2NDc2._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The Germans can no longer deny their impending doom. Grit comes from massive steam locomotives shot in black and white. The mortal struggle plays out on a personal level. The action is relentless.The director, John Frankenheimer, relies on the intelligence and empathy of the audience to convey his story. Much of the movie is concerned with the mechanicals of how a railroad works. It shows the dignity and solidarity of the workers, and their huge effort.The theme is the waste, the cost of war -- what is worth fighting for, what you actually do fight for even though it does not seem to be worth it, and the capricious outcome.

Who is the killer and why is the killer after them? My rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up, sometimes slightly down. However, I can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for Valentine. The first time I watched it, upon its theatrical release, I thought it was pretty awful--I gave it a 4 out of 10, the equivalent of an ""F"" letter grade. Watching it for a second time last night, I can't remember what the heck I didn't like about it. I can only assume that maybe I was really in the wrong mood to watch it, or maybe I just didn't get it. In any event, I loved it this time, giving it a 9 out of 10, or an ""A"".It might sound ridiculous saying I didn't get a film like this, but there is something to get. Valentine is almost a comedy/horror. Director Jamie Blanks, who was also responsible for 1998's Urban Legend, takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of Scream (1996) and pushes most of the elements up a notch, making Valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity (where absurdism is a positive stylistic term). On top of that, he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships. The humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects. Most of the situations in the film, and the modus operandi of the villain, humorous or not, are tied in to the Valentine's Day theme.Many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various clichÃÂ©-rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments. However, in light of the above, the film is intentionally clichÃÂ©d, implausible and ludicrous. It's as if Blanks is attempting (and mostly succeeding) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros. That's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on Valentine's Day. It's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film, and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre, making it prime fodder for Valentine's extravagant lampooning. Scream had a similar aim with its horror material, but the twist there was that the film was ""self-aware"". Valentine's Day is intentionally not self-aware; the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire. Lest some think I'm ""reading too much"" into the film, it's worthwhile to note that Blanks said in interviews that he ""didn't want to just do another slasher film after Urban Legend"" and producer Dylan Sellers said he wanted to do something ""more adult"".Other viewers may dislike the fact that Valentine's Day differs so much from its putative source material, the novel of the same name by Tom Savage. The novel's characters, setting and plot are very different from the film. Sellers has said, ""While it was a fine book, I didn't think it was the right story for a film"". So instead the novel, which is much dryer and more serious in tone, was used as a launching pad, a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on Valentine's Day. While those facts won't help purists familiar with the book like the film, it's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude. It's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme.Blanks' direction is impeccable visually. Valentine's Day has a lush look throughout, with complex, deep colors, interesting sets, and good staging. Blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark, with clearly conveyed action. He also directs his actors with aplomb, catalyzing often slyly humorous performances. David Boreanaz, as Adam Carr, is involved in many of the funniest moments.While Valentine's Day is no masterpiece, it's a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions. If you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxM2JjNTktYWE4Ni00YmZiLWFlNDEtMWYzMmI4N2NhYjk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The work of Salgado has testified some of the major (but lesser known) disasters of recent world history, none of which came within ear of the western world - much more interested in the brilliant lives of the fashion victims than in the tragic fate of the casualties of famines and wars.Nietzsche famously once wrote: ""When you look into the abyss, the abyss also looks into you"". Salgado had the guts to stare to the abyss, without blinking - but clicking. He did it to give to others the opportunity to know, and possibly to better understand the meaning of the term ""humanity"". Some of SebastiÃÂ£o Salgado images are horrible, but it is by far more horrible to think that without him those horrors would have happened with nobody to remember about them. His work creates grounds for memory, and memory grows some chances for hope, and hope give us and some reason to believe in a better future for our troubled planet.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjkyNjI3ODc0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU0MjM2NDE@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

""Jake"" Gittes investigating adultery and murder, and the money that comes from oil.","66","Just because it's no Chinatown, doesn't make this film bad","The Two Jakes and The Godfather 3 were released in the second half of 1990 and both films proved that sometimes it's best not to tamper with classics. This is not necessarily because sometimes a sequel can't compliment a classic, but because no matter what you do, there's no way to avoid comparing the new versions to the old. And the final chapter of the Godfather trilogy is vastly inferior to the first two. And Two Jakes is vastly inferior to Chinatown. But since Chinatown and the first two Godfathers are among the best films every made, that's a pretty pointless comparison. Just as The Godfather 3 stands on its own as a very sturdy and interesting piece of filmmaking, Two Jakes also works on its own merits. It's confusing, overlong (a full ten minutes more than the original), and never fully gels, but it's also passionate, intelligent filmmaking. Go figure.In his autobiography, producer Robert Evans refers to Robert Towne's script for Two Jakes as basically only half-finished. It was half-finished when they started shooting, half-finished when they made it half-way through the shoot, and it pretty much feels half-finished in the final product.  This is a movie where characters wander in and out and a full two-thirds of the storylines go essentially unresolved. The grand climax of the film (and trust me, I'm not spoiling anything) is an evidentiary hearing, for heavens sakes! And I couldn't really explain the plot if I wanted to, but here's the quick summary: It's fifteen years after Chinatown and Jake Gittes Jack Nicholson) has become older, fatter, and a good deal more bitter. He's now an Investigator respected throughout LA, but he's still haunted by his experiences with the Mulwrays, especially the late Evelyn. The film begins with a jealous husband, Jake Berman (Harvey Keitel), storming into a hotel room and killing his wife's lover, with Jake listening in the next room. Of course, you know the crime probably wasn't entirely about love or lust and that money probably had something to do with it. Money, history, and oil, actually. And it spins in circles from there. It's easy to notice that the film slacks off at around the half-way point. It's then that you realize just how tight Robert Towne's Chinatown script was. Even at a shred over two hours, every word counts, every gesture, every twist. Two Jakes is flabby in comparison. The dialogue is pleasantly hardboiled and the actors enjoy delivering it, but the resolutions of the various mysteries mostly fall flat. You either see them coming, or don't understand when they arrive. It's to Towne and director Jack Nicholson's credit that the film ends on a number of satisfying grace notes.Nicholson's direction is almost never the source of the film's flaws. And this is legitimately high praise in a film as twisting and convoluted as this. Of course, he again makes you appreciate the brilliant economy of Roman Polanski's direction of Chinatown, a film with an immeasurable amount of class. Nicholson produces several wonderful moments including a beautiful pull shot from the ocean to a teatime conversation with Kahn (who Chinatown fans will avidly remember). Nicholson and director of photography Vilmos Zsigmond capture a Los Angeles of burnt out dreams, on the brink of overdevelopment and overexpansion. The film has noir stylings but it respectfully looks different from Chinatown.Nicholson's performance is more a study of what has happened to the actor since Chinatown, rather than what has happened to the character. Because Jack was less of an icon when Chinatown was made, the original Jake Gittes is one of his least iconic performances. By the time he won his Oscar the next year for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest Nicholson had already become JACK (in all caps) and he hasn't looked back. In Two Jakes, Jake Gittes has become JACK. There's no getting around it. However, there's also no getting around the fact that Nicholson is a great actor and even if his performances are frequently variations on a theme, it's a pretty super theme.Two Jakes is peppered with supporting performances of varying degrees of depth. Harvey Keitel has never been better as the second of the two Jakes. His character is emotionally complicated and perhaps the only person in the film (besides Gittes) who gets to go through a character arc.  He plays it wonderfully. The femmes fatale in the film, as played by Madeline Stowe and Meg Tilly are less and more complicated than they seem. Ruben Blade, Richard Farnsworth, and Eli Wallach provide capable support when they're given anything to do.The fact is that like the Godfather 3, if you came upon Two Jakes with a completely open mind, you'd find it a complicated thriller, vastly more substantial than most films of the genre. The fact that it's got its flaws that it'll never compare to Chinatown are the basis for a 7/10 rating.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NjJjNDMtOTg2Zi00Y2Q3LWJhNDMtZTRkODdiYmNhZmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDY2MTk1ODk@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Kudos go to them for making a film so original and daring, so out of place in the family film market today, as it defies almost everything that stands for these days: you don't forget the entire movie within a few hours; rather, it stays with you, filling your head with bold and imaginative images that rival those of the best children's books out there.""Babe: Pig in the City"" is much like many other great sequels (""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""Aliens"") in that it is superior to the original but so different from it, that it is not even worth making a comparison of the two. Why have so many people rejected it? Why was it on so many critics' ten best lists, and the public shunned it so much? It is really rather simple. There is no place for a THOUGHT-PROVOKING family film in this day and age, with the exception of perhaps ""The Prince of Egypt.""The thing that makes me laugh here is, teenagers and adults alike are commenting on how violent ""Babe 2"" is, yet if I remember correctly few or no animals at all die in the film. And no big deal seems to be made when the same stuff happens to human beings in ""family films.""To be honest, I don't think they should have rated it G, simply because it seems that anyone seeing this under the age of nine would be confused and perplexed by it. Most people over that age however should be able to follow it well, and understand that the things happening in it are no worse than what kids (and especially teens) see everyday, whether it's on TV's ""The Simpsons"" (my favorite show) or something at the multiplex (a whole ARMY of people gets drowned in ""The Prince of Egypt""- a PG rated film).In the end I am truly hoping that ""Babe: Pig in the City"" is given at least some Oscar nominations, especially for the art direction, cinematography, and visual effects- all of which were superb. A great movie, even though it has not found an audience.This movie just screams: ""Give it another chance!""","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4ZDQ3NjktNjQ4Mi00NjU2LWFiZTEtYzhjODNlM2VhYTIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDIwODAwNzg@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The further I looked into the project and the more I learned about the cast and crew involved, I was hooked.The film is directed by Reed Morano and stars Peter Dinklage and Elle Fanning. The story follows a seemingly lone survivor of a mysterious apocalypse that stumbles upon a young girl. Throughout the film the two talk and bond, living in this quiet world Morano builds for his characters.Dinklage's acting was quiet and subtle, very rarely talking and communicating in glances. Fanning's character is loud and full of energy. The two have great chemistry. The film's romance is similar to Lost in Translation but isn't executed as well. Throughout the film it seems they are close, but never really romantic, just surviving. If it was built upon more, execution would be better.The cinematography in the film is spectacular. Morano's past in cinematography shines in this project. The atmosphere is built upon with the film relying on natural lighting. This has an amazing effect on the environment, giving it life and making it seem real.There are downsides to this movie. About two thirds of the way into the movie, it seems to take a total shift in the mood and story. The ending seemed like it didn't belong, ripped out of a mid-two thousands teen dystopian book. While the ending didn't ruin the film, it still left me unsatisfied.While the runtime of this film is just over an hour and thirty minutes, it takes its time. If you're going into this expecting a fast pace movie with quick dialogue and fast results, this movie isn't for you. If you're a fan of character studies and long, interrupted takes, you'll more than likely enjoy this movie.Overall, I Think We're Alone Now is an experience that I haven't had in a theater in a while. It's different than most of the films in theaters this year which is refreshing. It teaches people the importance of a strong and satisfying ending and how not to do that, but also how to set up an effective and interesting universe Check it out.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGZlOTEwNzgtM2U2OC00ZGI4LThjMGYtMzA4YTZmNzc4Njk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

When I saw the film in England having already watched it in France, I was, frankly, embarrassed! Terry Jones relies too much on direct translations and gags that don't fit... perhaps they should have used Bell and Hockeridge, the hugely talented translators of the actual books. Oh well.I definitely recommend the film, though, albeit only in the original French.

Both of those films dealt with issues arising from the Roaring Twenties out of religion. At the time I thought both were great dramatic pieces dealing with issues of the past. I thought how much we'd grown up as a country from 1925 to 1960.If you had told me that 46 years later we'd be fighting these same battles and that preachers had as much political power as they do I and many others would have said you were nuts. Yet here we are today in an age when Pat Robertson is taken as a serious political figure. Inherit the Wind is a dramatization of the famous Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925 when a biology teacher was arrested and challenged a law passed by the Tennessee State legislature making it a crime to teach anything other than the account of creation as set down in the Book of Genesis. Dick York is the biology teacher here, renamed Bertram Cates for the play and the film version of that play.In fact all the names of the dramatis personae of the Scopes Trial have been changed to allow some creativity by the authors Jerome Lawrence and Robert Lee. Spencer Tracy and Fredric March play fictionalizations of Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan named Henry Drummond and Matthew Harrison Brady respectively.Of course that is what Inherit the Wind is primarily known for, a duel of double Academy Award winners. In fact Spencer Tracy received another Academy Award nomination for this film, but lost to Burt Lancaster for Elmer Gantry. That's ironic to me because I thought March captured the essence of William Jennings Bryan better. Bryan is a man whose time has passed him by. But he's still a hero to the folks of small town rural America in the south and middle west. One thing to remember is that while Bryan was a great orator and advocate, he had not practiced law in over 30 years when he stepped into the courtroom for the trial. If he had been a better lawyer, he might not have fallen into the one big trap Tracy set for him and the trial and the attending publicity might have been better for his side.As good as Tracy is, the year before in Compulsion I think that Orson Welles captured the real Clarence Darrow in his character of Jonathan Wilk. No one in Hollywood could do long take speeches quite like Spencer Tracy though. I'm sure that's why Director Stanley Kramer hired him and they developed quite the screen partnership with Tracy doing four of his last five screen roles for Kramer. Stanley Kramer made some impeccable casting choices filling out the minor roles of the various townspeople of Hillsboro, Tennessee. There are two that I would single out. Claude Akins who usually played tough guys in various action films was astounding as the town preacher, the Reverend Jeremiah Brown. Sad to say there are still many like him out there. Akins's offbeat casting worked wonders, it turned out to be the high point of his screen career. On the opposite end of the spectrum was Noah Beery, Jr. who is a farmer and who's son was drowned some time before the events of the film. Beery is the town non-conformist, he refused to allow his son to be baptized and Akins has said the adolescent is in hell because of it.In a key scene when Tracy draws the ire of Judge Harry Morgan who sentences him to jail for contempt of court, Beery offers to put up his farm for collateral for Tracy's bail. Tracy's about to quit the case, but that simple gesture gives him hope, in the ultimate decency and clearheadedness of ordinary people. It's my favorite scene in Inherit the Wind.Stanley Kramer lived long enough to see this film become so relevant for today's times. I wonder what he must have thought.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjcwZjhlZmEtNjg3ZC00OTEwLWFjY2MtMDg2OTQwZWJmMGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

One can see that the supposedly ""bereaved"" father, is laughing before he gets up to the mike to give his speech and then starts crying with ""fake"" tears. It is strange that no ambulances or emergency helicopters showed up at the school. No police or parents were admitted into the building. The hospital was not alerted. The one teacher who was supposedly taken to the hospital was much older than the teacher who was supposed to be in the ambulance. No one who knew Adam Lanza had seen him since his childhood. There were no pictures of Adam Lanza in the Jr High or High School yearbooks. The type and number of guns and calibers that were used was inconsistent. They also mentioned about guns being in a car. Where was the spent brass? No one could shoot over 100 rounds in the time that was done with a pistol or a rifle without reloading several times. An authority said that the decibel level would be too great in a small room for one to fire over 100 rounds. The police also said that their was more than one shooter.

Oh boy!","It's hard to imagine a gay themed film where the main characters aren't drag queens, don't have AIDS, aren't bitchy, catty, flamboyant, tragic or shallow. As it turns out, gay people, like non-gay people, can be all those things (and aren't we all tired of it) and so much more. In fact, the most distinguishing characteristic of gay people is that, for the most part, they are virtually indistinguishable from non-gay people. Isn't it about time a movie just allowed its central gay characters to be a couple of cute young guys whose casual meeting teeters over the course of a hilariously frustrating evening on the verge of becoming more than a one night stand?Gabriel, played by Christian Campbell, Neve Campbell's older brother, is a shy, aspiring composer with dimples to die for. Mark, J. P. Pitoc, is an outgoing journalism student who earns money as a go-go boy and has the body to prove it. Pitoc and Campbell, who appear together again in the ""Thank You, Good Night"", gel beautifully as the put-upon would-be lovers. In a world where meeting and having sex can be a rather common and often all too impersonal event, they meet, and like most people their age, they want to have sex. But the story that gently unfolds is not at all common. It's tender, funny, and much more romantic than it sounds.Tori Spelling, it hurts me to even write this, is terrific as Gabriel's oh-so theatrical friend. She maintains a drama in her life that can be endearing, but is often times more annoying, the latter which Ms. Spelling portrays with great comic success. The rest of the cast is fairly unremarkable, with two notable exceptions. Steve Hayes is brilliant as a friend from Gabriel's theatre class whose hilarious ""Como te gusta mi pinga"" is the funniest cabaret number since Priscilla. Clinton Leupp as drag queen Coco Peru, delivers a delightful bathroom soliloquy that will have you in stitches. Even more amusing is the fact that Miss Coco looks distractingly like Ms. Spelling's character, right down to the overabundance of drama.Trick is an uplifting and life-affirming look at being young and gay and almost in love. Surely you were at least one of these things once.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWNmM2ZlMzctNmU1Ny00YWYxLWE5ZmEtNjlkMWViYmY1MDQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk1Njg5NTA@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

From my point of view, this was a good movie, that was well done, it was just so much better than Narvik from last year, that was just some kind of lousy war-romance movie that just shouldn't have been made. This was something that warmed my heart, something that made me think, and it was very entertaining. The whole crew that works together in the mines, it is not so clearly at the first sight but after a while this team-power looks very real and very organic, something that makes you feel home with the characters, and the actors did play very well, it was many Norwegians and many Swedish people, and I don't want to be mean but from my point of view Swedish people are playing more realistic and organic, like in here, but of course, the Norwegians played very well too. Good dialogues but sometimes it was annoying when they were saying a name too much, like basically in every sentence. Annoying things like that didn't happen much but sometimes, they could work on the dialogues in some places. The music was great, very Norwegian and very old-style, it did really fit the movie. When the action came, the suspense was on, like falling mines and fight scenes. This movie did also serve some inside facts about how to act in a mine, and what you should do when danger is coming. Concluding, this was a well told story, with some good music, plot, action sequences and high, valuable message.

Yet I (and the two white friends I went with) loved this movie! As I see it, people who have witnessed this movie can be divided into two camps: 1) reviewers (probably mostly white) who disliked the movie even when they tried to like it and 2) ordinary people (mostly probably black, as many tell us) who loved it. So why do many apparently white viewers not ""get it""? Why did I see it in my mostly white area with only about five other people in the audience?Well, a lot of people didn't like ""Showgirls"" or ""Carwash"" or ""Lonely Lady"" when they first came out, and now those are cult hits, even ""classics."" ""Diary"" is only like those movies in that it is similarly over-the-top, unapologetic, irony-free, awkward, amateurish (that is, not slick), and yet so intrinsically watchable you can't take your eyes of the screen for a split second. I must admit that I probably laughed at some ""inappropriate"" moments, but then so did Madea.

Wait--I'm not trying to sound pretentious, only trying to point out that like Shakespeare this movie mixes high melodrama with ""low"" comedic relief, music, and spectacle. The comic actors comment upon and undercut the ultra-seriousness or piety of the rest of the story--and so we can only enjoy it more when the plot rides another twist on its emotional roller-coaster.Tyler Perry is obviously a man with a vision--he doesn't have the finesse of Eddie Murphy, perhaps, but I admit I was halfway through the movie before I realized he was playing both Madea and old Joe AND Brian. My fear is now that he will be sucked in by Hollywood, the executives will convince him to deliver what they think white people want or ""need,"" and he will lose his rough but raucous magic. So when Hollywood comes knocking, please don't answer, Mr. Perry!

And thus I did so with ""One Cut of the Dead"". Well, at least for a whole staggering 35 minutes. Then I gave up from sheer boredom, frustration and lack of entertainment.This movie was bad, really bad. It was essentially just a movie about people running around like mindless chickens, screaming and yelling, while being chased by zombies with very, very animated arms and legs movements. It wasn't even funny to look at.And it didn't help much that the characters were more boring than wet cardboard. The choices that the characters in the movie took made absolutely no sense, not even in a stressful situation. It was just idiotic and embarrassing to witness on the screen. But staying true to it being a low budge movie, they had the talents to match the level of the movie.The zombie make-up and special effects were as to be expected for a low budget movie such as this. So don't expect a grand macabre visual tour de force here.There was just nothing in this movie that had any appeal to me, and after enduring for a staggering 35 minutes, I just gave up, never to return to watch the rest of the movie.

But this is more than just a neat trick. It works brilliantly. Instead of distancing the viewer from the narrative makes one feel more involved in the film's world. How dare this work? This kind of arty-farty stuff is usually guaranteed to annoy me - but this is nothing short of revelatory in its Russian doll-like idea of having fiction within fiction within fact...and you don't need to be some kind of high-brow film critic to appreciate it!All the performances are gob-smackingly good, and there isn't one moment in the film that bores, irritates, patronises or rings a false note. The cast inhabit their roles like they were born to play them. and the determination not to idealise them or their situations, makes my cynical anti-Hollywood production values heart sing for joy.Do not, I beg you, be put off by the epithet ""cult"" with which this film has been tarred as if it would appeal only to comic-book fans. No, the appeal here is universal - dealing with Pekar's existential worries and his search for the meaning in his life.

He came across as completely selfish and sleazy with virtually no redeeming qualities and it frustrated me that there seemed to be no explanation for every woman fawning over him. Characters made choices out of the blue and eventually I just grew to dislike all the characters I have loved in the first half.What also grated about this film is that sometimes I swear I could have been watching 'Atonement' the amount of time Keira Knightley said ""Come back to me.""

This is my third ""first feature"" from a writer/director this week, but there endeth any similarities. Ana Lily Amirpour presents the first ever Iranian romantic vampire thriller that blends the styles of Spaghetti Westerns, graphic novels and 1950's rebel flicks, while making a social statement regarding Muslim women.This festival favorite is an expanded version of Ms. Amirpour's 2011 short film of the same title, and the use of black and white, combined with cinematographer Lyle Vincent's extraordinary photography, delivers a beautifully stark dream-like atmosphere that lends itself well to the sparse dialogue approach.Despite minimal conversation, we quickly recognize Saeed (Dominic Rains) as the ultra-arrogant drug dealer and bullying pimp, Arash (Arash Marandi) as the hard-working dutiful nice guy who sees himself as a would-be James Dean, Hossein (Marshall Manash) as the drug-addicted dad who burdens his son, and Atti (Mozhan Marno) as the aging, powerless prostitute with little hope. There is even the street boy (Milad Eghbali) who sees all and says little ÃÂ and is the target of the film's most terrifying scene (and maybe one of the most terrifying bloodless scenes of any horror film).What really stands out about this low-budget gem is the seamless and effective mixing of genres. In addition to the ""vampire"" moments, there are a couple of the most quietly erotic scenes that I can recall (including an ear-piercing), and even a quite humorous scene with an under-the-influence Arash mesmerized by a lamp post while wearing a Dracula costume and being observed by a real vampire.The vampire is played perfectly by Sheila Vand, whose intoxicating eyes and subtle facial gestures convey all whether she is feeding her appetite, being gently seduced by Arash, or slowly coasting on her skateboard. Her only time to unleash pent-up emotions is the previously mentioned scene when she warns ""Be a good boy"". Otherwise, she is the lonesome vampire in search of connection who periodically weeds out the bad men Ã¢ÂÂ simultaneously improving society and empowering women.It's an odd production as the characters speak Farsi, but filming took place outside Bakersfield, California in a locale that fits the story town's name, Bad City. Any influence of Iranian culture is only evident through interpretation and the excellent cast. The beautiful camera work is complemented by an outstanding and unusual soundtrack ÃÂ a combination that proves Ms. Amirpour's eye and feel for storytelling. The minimal dialogue approach is successful thanks to the atmospheric style and the talents of the cast (many of whom will be familiar to American TV and film audiences). It's an exciting first feature and has many anxiously awaiting the next project from Ana Lily Amirpour.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzNjMyMjU2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzA3NjQ0MzE@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Kurzel broke onto the scene in 2011 with his feature debut, ""The Snowtown Murders,"" which played as part of the Cannes Critics Week. That film's success immediately gave him the confidence to helm a much more violent and haunted adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"", with Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard in the lead roles. He also was given the promotion of competing in the main competition of Cannes.After that film's critical success, Hollywood came knocking as he was offered, and accepted, to direct the big-screen adaptation of the popular video game franchise ""Assassin's Creed"", which allowed him to reteam with Fassbender and Cotillard. However, Kurzel wasn't able to make the leap into studio filmmaking, as the film was a critical and commercial bomb. He tried to recompose himself a few years later by going back to his roots with the Australian true-crime-thriller ""The True History of the Kelly Gang."" The relative success of that film didn't prompt Kurzel to return to the big studios, instead, he has doubled down on his newfound career path with ""Nitram"", which premiered in competition at the Cannes Film Festival.The film tells the life story of Tasmanian native Martin Bryant, who eventually was responsible for the largest massacre by a single person in Australian history after he killed 36 people at Port Arthur in 1996. From the very start, Bryant was beset with mental problems that made him act aggressively towards others and hold little concern for human safety. After he was sentenced to life in prison (where he remains to this day), Bryant was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome and deemed to have an IQ of 66, roughly the same as an eleven-year-old.The title of the film (which is Martin spelled backward) comes from the nickname Bryant was given by childhood bullies, further hindering him from forming any human connections. American Caleb Landry Jones plays the titular character with brilliance, showcasing how far someone can go down the rabbit hole. Jones has made a small name for himself by playing supporting parts as sleazy weirdos in films such as ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" and ""Get Out"". In his first major leading role, he has knocked it out of the park. He produces the fear one gets from a horror movie villain while still bringing enough authenticity to fit the film's grounded tone. His win for Best Actor at Cannes was well deserved, and some Oscar buzz should be in order.Also within the cast is frequent Kurzel collaborator Effie Davis, who plays Bryant's much older companion Helen, who lives alone in a rundown mansion with fourteen dogs and several dozen cats. Bryant and Helen formed a connection based on their status as social outcasts, which Jones and Davis are able to explore. Their interactions together are awkward and fractured, and never answer the question of exactly what kind of relationship they share.Anthony LaPaglia and Judy Davis, both of whom are superb, portray Bryant's parents, who have differing perspectives on how they should keep their son safe. LaPaglia prefers to give Bryant a bit of freedom in hopes that he will figure out the world for himself, while Davis feels that he is incapable of doing such a thing and must be kept on a short leash.Making a biopic about a country's worst human offender brings with it a lot of trap doors, such as vindicating the perpetrator or glorifying the harm that they caused. Thankfully, Kurzel avoids those errors as he approaches the film with a matter-of-fact style that only wants to illustrate how this event was allowed to happen. Abandoning the flashy style he is known for, Kurzel lets the actors and simple camerawork tell the story. I was reminded of Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant"" while watching the film at its world premiere. There is not one singular grand answer as to why this happened and how it could have been stopped, simply because there isn't a one-size-fits-all response. All we can do is look back on what happened and see what can be done for the future, which Kurzel doesn't seem to have much hope for as his postscript explains how the gun laws enacted as a result of Bryant's actions have not been properly enforced, opening the possibility of this happening again.Justin Kurzel's ""Nitram"" was one of the best films out of the Cannes Film Festival as it explores a real-life tragedy with both grace and severity. While my body hated the experience of watching the film because of the stiff muscles I was left with due to the intensity, my mind was left with a better understanding of this dark chapter in human history.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5OGYxOTktYzQ4OC00ODk4LTlmYjktOGRkYzBiMWQ4MWQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzQwMTY2Nzk@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He explodes in front of our eyes. Fearless, horrible, pathetic, sad but above all truthful. With the kind of truth we're not use to deal with. I was horrified because I understood it, like James Mason in Lolita. I'm not sympathising with him but I'm understanding him. The counterpart to Roberts's human monster is not Mariel Hemigway's beautiful Dorothy Stratten but Carroll Baker as Dorothy's mother. We can tell by looking into her face that she knows. She knows,she senses, she fears to be right because there is so little she can do. Carroll Baker's superb portrayal represents us. We dread what she dreads and like her, we're impotent to the unavoidable. Star 80 is a masterpiece. Like all of Bob Fosse's work, nothing is casual. The puzzle that he presents us with, connects the dots in a twisted, although immediately recognisable, pattern, leading inexorably to the most excruciating domestic tragedy.

I remember feeling frustrated.  I watched it again last night on satellite and decided this really is a great movie, but it is hard to watch.  It is a very real love story, but don't confuse that as meaning it is a typical romantic story.Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia play a couple definitely in love, but struggling with their relationship after Meg Ryan's character comes back from detox. Instead of being cured, she is confused and they realize there is a wedge that comes from an experience they can't share.  She has AA friends that her husband can't relate to, but she needs someone who can understand and her husband isn't it.One mark of great writing is when the characters are not saintly or demonic, but shades of grey.  Andy Garcia's character is a really nice guy, but he's not saintly.  He resorts to sarcasm out of his frustration in not being able to help his wife.  Of course, she doesn't want his help, she wants his understanding. She is basically a good person, but she can't sort through her feelings and ends up being unknowingly cruel to her husband.After one scene, my wife stated, ""Now HE frustrated me"".  I said, ""I was frustrated too, but BY HER"".  This movie really pegs male and female relationships.Superbly written, superbly acted.

It was buried in the summer of 1998 to mostly positive reviews and was later unsuccessfully reinvented 9 months later here in the UK on the back of Psycho which also starred Vaughn and Heche. Its been unfairly treated by the now defunct Polygram as it is a quite incredible little drama with some superb performances and some moments of great power. The premise is relatively simple. Three friends on holiday in Malaysia. Two leave. The police arrive and find hash where they were staying. The third is put in jail. Two years later a lawyer finds the two remaining men in New York and tells them that their friend was found guilty of trafficking. They must go back to share the punishment or he will die in 7 days.Its a frightening dilemma and you can't help but ask yourself the same question. Would you go back? If one goes back they go to prison for 6 years. If both go they will have 3 years each. All of the arguments are put forward, making the answer not seem as clear as originally imagined. The timeframe is made even tenser with titles reminding us of how many days are remaining. Vince Vaughn plays our hero who doesn't always act in the morally correct way we expect him to do. He doesn't immediately decide to go back, making us question if we would either. Vaughn gives the finest performance of his career as the not completely likeable 'Sheriff'. Anne Heche plays the increasingly desperate lawyer who will do anything to save her client from execution. And her desperation is made completely believable by Heche's multi-faceted performance.And then Joaquin Phoenix plays the imprisoned Lewis who has little screen time but whenever he's on he totally captivates. His video message to his two friends is heartbreaking. There are numerous twists which serve to further the emotional capital which is placed in the conclusion.And by the time the suspenseful court scene arrives, you will find yourself nervously hoping for a happy ending. Needless to say the film ends with a succession of unspeakably powerful scenes. Its hard to remember a film which I found as moving as this. It serves as a very poignant anti-drugs message. Its impact will stay with you for days, making it really quite unforgettable. Hunt this down. You will be richly rewarded.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjIyZDZmNDYtNTk0Mi00N2MyLWFhN2ItZjhiYzY4ZGU2NjI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0NTI0Nw@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Niladri Kumar and Joi Barua have given absolutely pure music which fits perfectly into the story as well as in Kashmir. Not only that, but the lyrics have been penned by Irshad Kamil. Thus, songs are literally talking to us so much while in the film, (or even after the movie, too!) and make us fall in love with the story. All songs are incredible. Ahista is the one song I will remember for giving me one of the strongest goosebumps ever. Laila, Tu, Sarphiri - all are fantastic. While in Hafiz song, the memory of Sadda Haq pops up in the mind. In fact, there are many portions when we went to that stages which we had seen in Imtiaz Ali's films. And somehow I know why!Because, the transition is important in every film of Ali. While, here we are seeing possibly the biggest transition a man can have, like Qais to Majnu. This is where the film goes beyond the expectations, beyond the reach of our mental state, beyond all the boundaries. And it becomes the must see film. But only for those who believe in Imtiaz and his stories, or in poetic explanations, or in purity which love brings.Laila a.k.a. Tripti is beautiful, adorable and truthful to her lover as well as her father. Though both are newcomers, the story and performance is such that we can feel for them. I found Avinash as Qais like average. But when he returned in the second half as Majnu is mind blowing. Every reviewer has mentioned about him and his performance. Because, he has done his part brilliantly. The complexity of Majnu has been implanted magically. Namaaz scene in that portion speaks a lot. Whole review can be written on that scene only, because it says a lot. Add one more plus point, which I completely forgot was the beautiful Kashmir. There are many scenes, but don't miss the first scene after interval. Magic is awaiting for you in theaters. Kudos to Sajid Ali. Actually, the first half was not so great. It was just good. The things happening there which eventually lead the film to its most dramatic exploitation, were not to be missed. It looks like that there is nothing, but when the story strikes you, you feel for every bit of the film. If you are going for this one, go with open mindset. Close your eyes before the film, and let the film open your eyes as well as you completely. It will become your most valuable experience.  I don't care about box-office numbers. Even the makers of this film do not care, too. Art can never be perfect, that too in its purest form. This film is a pure art which makes it an imperfect one. If it is perfect, it can't be true love. Feel the madness of true love.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWZjODA1MmUtYmU0My00M2JiLTk2ODEtYzMxODJmMTM5MzY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In 1842 a naval sloop, the U.S.S. Somers, had a court martial for three crew members (one, Midshipman Philip Spencer, was the son of Secretary of War John Canfield Spencer), which ended with their being found guilty and hanged. To this day there is debate if Spencer (a troubled youth) was even serious about seizing the ""Somers"". The other occurred in 1944 at Port Chicago, California, when, a few weeks after a terrible accident that killed many men loading ammunition on a boat, their replacements refused to work under existing unsafe conditions. This led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision - against the workers, who claimed they were not under military law. But the best known mutiny in the American navy is that on the U.S.S. Caine, during the hurricane that preceded the battle of Okinawa. That this is a fictional mutiny does not seem to attract any attention. THE CAINE MUTINY was a successful novel, Broadway play (""THE CAINE MUTINY COURT MARTIAL"") and a great movie. It remains the American equivalent of the mutiny on the H.M.S. Bounty.The performances of the leads, Bogart, Johnson, MacMurray (his second of three great heels), Ferrer, Tully, and E.G.Marshall are all first rate, as are the supporting cast (which includes Lee Marvin, Claude Atkins, and Jerry Paris - all of whom had quite substantial careers after this film). Only Robert Francis did not have a substantial career after his fine Ensign Keith - he died in a plane crash in 1955.There are mental images from the film (mostly connected to Bogart's Queeg) that people remember - even spoof. Every time you see some character showing nervous ticks, if he or she pulls out a pair of small metal balls and roll them in their hand, it is a salute to Bogie's originally doing it in THE CAINE MUTINY. And his magnificent moment of success: ""the strawberries"", and how he proved the theft with geometric precision, remains a signal that the person speaking has too many fixations.Interestingly, the film makes Queeg better (if still sick) than the play does. When cross examined by Greenwald at the court martial of Maryk and Keith, Queeg is asked about whether or not he overused his right to free transport of liquor and other items from Hawaii to the mainland from the navy. Queeg at first denies it, but when Greenwald says he can bring in (as witnesses) people connected with the sale of the items and the transport of them, Queeg suddenly remembers that he might have. This is not in the film, but it shows that Queeg was not all that clean an officer.That aside, the impact of the film is still terrific half a century after it was shot. It illustrates that personality flaws frequently causes the problems that affect all of us, and that we need more understanding of each other's problems to avoid the bigger ones. From a case of over-extended battle fatigue, the crew of a warship are driven to accept an act of mutiny against it's captain in an emergency situation. And it almost gets two officers disgraced or hanged.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4ODg4NzA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDcwODI5MjE@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

There is clearly a very eager and talented sound designer and editor responsible for creating most of the tension. Every single creak and footstep is perfectly placed for the best scares. The plot is the ""weakest"" part, but it's nothing you'll care about. The best thing is that it mercifully steers clear of all ""jump"" scenes we know and hate from American scary movies.After the first act, lightning starts to come in more and more and almost replaces sound as the tension-maker.

We watch as Walter Abrams is talking on the phone with someone who will not be able to provide an elephant for his daughter's birthday party. Walter barks to his assistant, ""Get me Ringling"". When the call finally comes through, he demands to know whether he is talking to Barnum or Bailey, which is a funny line. Wasn't P.T.

He and his associates stand to make millions out of the jerks they pursue to do their betting with his firm.

Brandon gets to meet the insiders, but little does he know who he is dealing with, or much less, what is expected of him. After all, he is just as good as the winners he can produce.The film, directed by D. J. Caruso, a man who has worked extensively in television, has a glossy look. The screen play by Dan Gilroy could have used some tighter editing, because at two hours it feels a bit long.Al Pacino, as Walter, has some good moments; we have seen him in better roles, and this one is a composite of other things he has done before. Mr. Pacino compensates when the screen play is not going anywhere by applying an intensity that doesn't go well with the others playing opposite him. Matthew McConaughey is a light weight actor who, aside from his good looks, doesn't bring anything to this story. Rene Russo is obviously a tall woman who towers over Mr. Pacino in most of their scenes together. Their relationship doesn't come across as being a real thing. Jeremy Piven and Armand Assante make good contributions in supporting the principals.While ""Two for the Money"" is by no means a horrible film, it just doesn't have anything new to say.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAzOTAzNzkyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTAzNjM3._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Equality if it can be reached in marriage, makes it work. Marriage is rocked when an equilibrium is not reached. A dove can be caressed and be a symbol of peace and purity; a dove can defecate and dirty as wellWhite in the movie is used as an epiphany of the joyous moments in marriage. The doves are weaved in Kieslowski visually and aurally to accentuate the marriage as a rite of passage in life. He brings in the phrase ""light at the end of the tunnel"" towards the end of the film. There is another marriage, that of Mikolaj in the subplot that also survives in a strange way.The film begins with divorce proceedings and ends with the wife signalling the reinstatement of the wedding ring on her finger. The film begins with husband recalling the wedding that has failed. The doves flying overhead unload excreta on him. Towards the end of the film, the husband again recalls the wedding as he sets off for the wife's prison.Kieslowski's treatise on equality is based on marriage as a great leveller with the doves flutter captured on the soundtrack appearing as a frequent reminder of marital bonds. It even appears in the underground metro, an unlikely place if you have a logical mind. You have to throw away logic if you need to enjoy this film.There are aspects of the film that are obviously unrealistic. Putting a grown man in a suitcase and letting the suitcase go through airport security is not feasible. Moreover, the director shows the heavy suitcase perched precariously on a luggage cart. Impossible to believe all these details.But the deeper question is whether Kieslowski was using marriage as a metaphor for politics? There is the mention of the Russian corpse with the head crushed for sale, there is a mention of the neon sign that sputters...The name Karol Karol seems reminiscent of Kafka.Sex in this film is not to be taken at face value. Impotence of Karol Karol at strategic points of the film is deceptive. He apparently does more than hair care for women clients at his hair care parlor in Poland (suggested, not shown). I have a great admiration for Polish cinema, having gown up watching works of Wajda and Zanussi. I met Kieslowski in 1982 when he attended an international film festival in Bangalore, India, promoting his film ""Camera Buff,"" another film with Jerzy Stuhr, who plays Jurek in ""White"". I took note of ""Camera Buff"" but I could not imagine the director of ""Camera Buff"" would evolve into a perfectionist a decade later. Stuhr has been metamorphosed from a live wire in ""Camera Buff"" to an effeminate colleague of Karol Karol in ""White"". ""White"" is a carefully made work with support of other top Polish directors in the wings--Zanussi and Agniezka Holland.Although the film is heavy in symbolism, it is also a parody. Karol Karol comes to kill with a blank bullet and a real one. Did he plan that out, when he did not know who he was going to shoot?The performances are all brilliant--the good Polish, Hungarian, and Czech filmmakers extract performances from their actors that could humble Hollywood directors, because the stars are not the actors but the directors. Great music. Great photography. And a very intelligent script.This is a major film of the nineties--providing superb wholesome entertainment and food for thought. The film deservedly won Kieslowski the ""best director"" award at the Berlin Film festival in 1994. It is sad for the world of cinema that Kieslowski is no longer with us.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1ODkzOWItNmM4NS00OGQzLTg5NjctOThjY2M1MGI5ZTRkL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

A mix-up leaves him searching for his family, who have been left in the clutches of wild lions.","68","Totally insane, one of a kind movie...","You know what? Sometimes words really aren't enough to do justice to something.Roar has to be without a doubt the most insanely unsafe cinematic undertaking I have ever had the pleasure of watching. The unbelievably high level of danger is quite frankly there for everyone to see up on the screen as we watch a group of actors interact with over one hundred big cats with no protection whatsoever! It was inspired by the success of the lion drama Born Free (1966). And you might make the observation that there is fifteen years between these two movies and think this strange, well that's because this flick took eleven years from start to finish! Its production met with all manner of set-backs such as fire, flood and disease; each of which put the film's schedule back. But more to the point, it was as dangerous to work on as it looks on screen. The opening credits state that no animals were hurt in the making of the film, what they could not say with as much confidence was that there were no humans hurt! As it was, seventy cast and crew were injured, including cinematographer Jan de Bont who was partially scalped, Tippi Hedren had her neck bitten, Melanie Griffiths almost lost an eye, Jerry and John Marshall both required extensive stitches, while Noel Marshall was attacked so often it took years for him to recover from his injuries. When you watch Noel in action in this film it is not exactly hard to see why! In fact some of the injuries can be seen happening on screen. It is madness, pure and utter madness.But because of this, it makes for highly entertaining and bizarre viewing. Unfortunately, the public back in 1981 didn't seem to agree and Roar was a box office disaster. To be honest, this is not entirely surprising as this feels far more like a cult movie than blockbuster material, given its utter strangeness. For a start it doesn't really have a plot and it boils down to a few events that bring our human cast into contact with the big cats. The story barely makes sense if you think about it very long. But who needs a story when you've got this insanity on screen? The madness and health and safety black hole that the events on screen represent mean that a story needs be no more than an afterthought. For what it's worth, Noel Marshall - wrote, starred, directed and financed it and his wife Tippi Hedren, who was a wildlife activist who campaigned for the protection of big cats, was the big name draw. Hedren, of course, was previously most well-known for her starring role in The Birds (1963) where she was famously mauled and scratched by an assortment of flying fiends. Well, all I can say is that what she experiences on Roar makes the actions of the birds in Alfred Hitchcock's classic seem positively reticent by comparison.The actors are all splendidly game and deserve huge amounts of credit for their nerve but the real stars of Roar are the big cats and rampaging elephants. This is the ultimate wet dream for any lover of the big cats in particular and we have the very strange scenario of seeing lions, cheetahs, panthers, leopards and tigers interacting with each other. Watching them violently wrestle is a pretty nerve shredding thing, except if you are Noel Marshall that is, he usually runs in to join them! But on the whole, while there are a few continuity errors and the editing is full-on and sporadic, this is exciting stuff that could never in a million years be described as boring. It truly defines the term 'one of a kind'. With health and safety legislation what it is now, there is no way in hell there will ever be another film like Roar. It's truly unique and I sure lapped it up.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTRhNzVjNDUtN2ExMi00OWIwLWIyNTMtYTRmNmIwZDEwMjcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc5NjEzNA@@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The story, recorded in Herodotus, concerns a small band of troops from Sparta who held off the advance of the Persian army in the 5th century B.C. In doing so, they gave their fellow Greeks time to organise a larger army. Themes include: democracy vs. despotism, and sacrifice for the sake of the common good. Ever stoic Richard Egan (star of ""Pollyanna,"" ""Esther and the King,"" and other fun films) does a great job of projecting the inner strength of Spartan leader Leonidas.

So I really have no basis to compare this sequel to. Therefore, I will continue with this review in light that I have not seen the original remake...The film opens with a Geena Davis Lookalike giving birth to a son; she dies, the baby lives. Baby grows older, and because he is 1/4 fly, he grows at a rapid rate, for some reason. I'm not sure why this would make him bigger instead of smaller, but oh well. His name is Martin, and he turns into Eric Stoltz when he is five. Yes, you read that right. Five. Martin is looked over by the head of a company, where he is kept and given medication to keep him from turning into a fly...But soon young Martin finds out that not everything is what it seems, and he begins to mutate into...THE LIZARD. Well, that's what he looks like, anyway.As I watched this, I kept a careful eye on Eric Stoltz. Why? Well, as I'm sure everyone knows by now, he was originally cast for Marty McFly for ""Back to the Future,"" and they filmed much of the movie with him before Bob Zemeckis dropped him for Fox. In fact, there is still a scene where he is diving into the Delorean that is intact. Freeze frame the film and you can see it's not Fox. I always thought that footage looked odd - like it wasn't Fox doing the stunt...Anyway, I watched Stoltz and realized how bad he would have been as Marty McFly. He just isn't hyper enough - Michael J. Fox was perfect for Marty, Stoltz would have ruined it. He's not a bad actor, mind you. He's perfect for this role (well at least ""good"" for this role), but for Marty? Nah... On a side note, I'm not sure if this is a coincidence or bizarre in-joke, but Stoltz's character plays a kid named Martin...similar to Fox's character Marty McFly...Martin...Marty.... And, I thought of something else that I haven't seen someone point out before. Marty's last name in ""BttF"" is McFly. What does Martin turn into in this film? A FLY! Martin the Fly, Marty McFly...taking a quote from ""Uncle Buck"": ""Is there a little similarity here? Ooh, I think there is!""The film was directed by the creature effects artist of the original - and sequel: Chris Walas. You might recognize his name, because he wrote ""Gremlins 2"" and did the creature effects for ""Gremlins,"" as well. Anyway, he directs the film pretty good for a creature effects artist...I guess...What I like so much about this movie is its high campy quality. It is a hybrid of B horror movies from the fifties and sixties and the ""new breed"" of horror films in the eighties, that were like B horror movies with gore. Lots of gore. I guess it doesn't qualify as strictly campy, because the old horror movies were not so disgusting...so I just call these films the eighties B horror movies. Simple enough, eh?I have always been a sucker for the campy horrors from the eighties, especially when they are sequels that tread into old territory. For example, in one scene we see footage of Jeff Goldblum being interviewed. Martin watches this with interest. And what I think is so interesting is that we can look back and say, ""Oh, yes, that was before Goldblum knew he was turning into a fly."" It's just interesting to do that. It seems like many films from the eighties would have archive footage from the original film. Anyway, ""The Fly II"" is a lot like these films. It gives us a glance back at the original. I'm not sure if I can explain in words what this does. It just provides a feeling for me - kind of like campy horrors make some people feel good. I like when horror movies--or any movies, for that matter--travel into the film before...we can look at the old characters and say, ""Oh, yes, that was before this was going to happen..."" It's just fun to do. I can't describe it in words.This movie, like many horror sequels from the eighties, is just enjoyable. Odd, but enjoyable. It's hard not to have fun watching it. If you take it seriously you're going to have a pretty hard time watching, but if you turn off the brain for two hours you'll have some fun.My only two complaints is that this movie is about a half hour too long, and the creature looks like a lizard and not a fly. Other than that, it is a fun ride. Not great, but a good, well done horror movie that never takes itself too seriously. Perfect for a Friday night.3/5 stars -John Ulmer","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTAyYjljNDctODg5Mi00YjYxLTk5MTMtZTk3MDk4NGZkN2MwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The first time I missed a bit of the murder plot, but repeated viewings just enhance the movie. It has started making me wanted to go out, get a terrier and call it Asta, drink too much for my own good and become a private eye detective. And move to New York. The lovable couple make it all look fun, and even if they do drink too much. Only after I have snapped out of admiration mode for the movie I remember that they were highly paid actors following a script in a hit film of 1934, and I'm living in the year 2000, cannot get a dog, am living in Sydney, and worst of all, I'm fourteen, so I can't drink or become a detective. Such is the modern manner of the movie. It is one of the very few films of its time that retains its freshness, intrigue and brilliant humour. William Powell and Myrna Loy are incredibly likeable, the wisecracking darlings of society who we all want to know. Their performances were both absolutely brilliant! Some of their antics are a good deal wilder than those we are used to, but in fear of being caught up in murder would keep me away from them, but not long enough. I don't believe there are any shallow characters at all. Thank goodness for ""The Thin Man"". One of the first to show an affectionate couple in love, I'm still scanning for the same in movies of the 50s. W.S Dyke is of course not one of the most remembered directors of his time, but for this alone he could be considered a great director. He was not Alfred Hitchcock, but he successfully combined high comedy, crime and thrills into one film. No wonder the major film studios were hot after this property.  And Dyke didn't have to rely on the excruciatingly hilarious elements of slapstick. A married couple and a dog was all that was needed. Such a simple thing to emphasise on, and how well it worked! Could there be a more stolen plot of today?Unfortunately, MGM, despite creating one of the best teamings of the era by putting the platonic Powell and Loy together, released this film in 1934. A nominee for Best Picture, Actor and Director, among other things, it was Capra's ""It Happened One Night"" that made history by becoming the first film in history to sweep the five major categories at the Oscars. If it had been released in 1933, it would have beaten the now forgotten ""Calvacade"", in 1935 it may have swept some Oscars up against ""Mutiny on the Bounty"". I wonder why Loy was not nominated. The film simply could not have been done without her.Powell and Loy went on to make many movies together. Asta, appeared again as George in the 1938 slapstick masterpiece ""Bringing Up Baby"". Although we need some good movies now, no one should even think contemplate for a split second on a remake. There is no way justice could be done to this film. It is a comic masterpiece that continually tricks the viewers, and without a doubt, one of the very best and brightest movies of the 1930s. I hope I can watch the other ""Thin Man"" movies. I will definitely be reading the book. The film ended half an hour ago, but I already feel like going back for a second helping.

None of its sequels or imitators could even come close. Until now. Halloween H20 is a fantastic film. Unlike other films of this genre, it realizes that you need to care about the characters in order for the film to scare you. Gore does not equal terror. The original Halloween knew that and H20 knows it. It allows you to get to know the characters so you can root for them in the end. Unlike the Scream-type movies of today, teenagers are not the only ones with brains here. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a performance superior to her one in the original. Her character was destroyed from the events of the first film. We get to see her rebuild herself as she finally faces the fear that has haunted her for 20 years. Kudos to director Steve Miner. He creates a perfectly creepy atmosphere, allows Michael Myers to move like a person instead of a robot, and throws everything but the kitchen sink at us in a white knuckle ending.

Find a trend in literature of the 40s and 50s, movies of the 50s and 60s, or television of the 50s through the 70s, and it is somehow made fun of in this movie.Another reason that I like this film is the fact that everyone involved, and there are many, many recognizable names involved with this project, seems to be having so much fun doing it. Several of the best moments for me are those when actors are playing, tongue-in-cheek, the same types of roles for which they were famous in other ""serious"" movies.The movie is incredibly funny if you are in the right mood, and with the right crowd. Even if not, however, there are enough funny moments to make this worth watching. The pacing and style are sometimes uneven, which I found worked toward a purpose, but that may make it hard for some to watch the movie straight through. If that is the case, watch it in two sittings; it's worth the extra effort.One game you can play, if you know the times or are old enough to remember first-hand, is to find how many books, TV shows/icons, and movies are good-naturedly ridiculed throughout the movie.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDJhMDU0OWQtM2QwNS00ODZhLWE2MDctNzdhYmNiZGI4OTdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I was the only one in the theater which is sad but great for me bc I legit OPENLY SOBBED at how moving it was. It's a simple premise that personalizes a family conquering insurmountable odds. Script and acting had some great dialogue between action to make you truly connect with each character- nonfat to be trimmed imho.I truly feel like the dynamics of the family- mom (8 months pregnant), dad, their teenager, and dad's father are relatable whether you have been in that exact position of relationships or not. The dad (Peter Facinelli) just embodied this character- the fear a father faces trying to protect his family while also trying to stay strong and hopeful for them. And the mother just embodies what women can and will do to keep their children safe. The teenage son shows vulnerability while also stepping up to the plate despite his fear.I also love how they acknowledged the impact these disasters have on first responders.

Clive Barker has often toyed with our preconceptions that all ""monsters"" must be blindly destructive brutes, as opposed to the endearingly rational and decidedly intelligent Cenobites.

The Chipmunk Adventure is just plain fun. I, personally, found the chipmunk show boring when I was younger, and I don't remember how I ended up watching this movie. But I am really glad that I did.

I am keeping mine for me, and when my son gets old enough, we can enjoy it together. An adult who has not seen the movie before might find it boring, but if he/she does, then they are too warped by todays conception of what a 'good' animated flick is. There are no REAL celebrity voices, no fancy computer animated effects, just good animation, kick-ass songs, and a really solid, enjoyable storyline. The characters are impossible to forget, and the famous 'Boys/Girls of Rock 'n' Roll' seen has stuck with me for years.

She's one of my favorite comedic actresses and I was happy to see that she got a starring role in a comedy. Well technically she was a lead in Zack & Miri but in this movie it's all about The Elizabeth Banks Show. Literally. She plays a news reporter who spends a night out with friends, gets a little too drunk, goes home with some guy, then the next morning when she leaves to go to work she realizes that she left her phone in the apartment, finds out her car was towed, and of course that she left her purse in the car. So basically it's a walk of shame since everything goes horribly wrong for her and she has to get to work on time because some news execs are looking at her for a promotion or something. Let me just say I did not laugh once throughout this movie. I chuckled at a couple parts sure, but it was at stupid things like Bill Burr as a policeman telling a guy to drop his cookies, or Bill Burr calling a kid an asshole. Burr gets all of the good lines in the script basically - him and Kevin Nealon who barely gets 5 minutes of screen time.Seriously, this is bottom-of-the-barrel humor. It's basically ""hey look at that girl, she's totally hopeless and a lot of sh*t is happening to her."" But yeah, that's not funny, and after a while you just start to feel bad for her. I mean, everyone in this movie is SO stupid. The police in this film are probably the dumbest in any movie ever, and they're usually pretty stupid in movies so that's saying something. I know it's a nitpick but holy crap there are so many things wrong with this movie. It's borderline offensive at times, like everyone thinks she's a hooker because she's wearing a dress and no matter how many times she denies it they still treat her like one. It's just uncomfortable to watch. And the dialogue is horrendous. Whoever wrote this movie needs to be arrested because it is just mind-numbingly awful. Some scenes left me like ""wait... what was the joke? was that really it?"" Every character in this movie is incredibly stupid. Frustratingly so. None of it is believable. Not one word coming out of anyone's mouth holds any merit. It's a garbage script and this should not have been green-lit. Seriously. Awful.I have to give it a 2/10 for Elizabeth Banks. If nothing else, this movie proved that Banks can carry a movie as a likable leading woman. She was kind of typecast as the trashy girl, but the hot sexy kind of trashy, but still trashy. But here she's a good girl with a good job who gets dragged out to a bar with her friends and things just go wrong. She's a great actress and she's the only reason I kept watching this movie. She is gorgeous. She glows on screen, literally. She's in a bright yellow dress. She does what she can with the script but there's just nothing for her to do. It just isn't funny, and it's not her fault at all, or any of the cast for that matter. There are so many funny people in the supporting cast whose talent is wasted here. And James Marsden, what are you doing man? It's a filler character, a generic romcom lead, but with a lot less screen time. Everything in this movie has been done before, all of it is generic, all of it is filler, none of it should've been put on screen.This movie made me feel bad for Elizabeth Banks, and I hope she scores a good script that can actually put her comedic talent to use. This was just a disaster. Horrendous film. The writers need to take a walk of shame right out of Hollywood.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODg2Mzk0NzU2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjAyNjYxMTE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Sure it was manipulative, and sure it tried it's best to make you feel all mushy inside, but you know what...I guess I was just in the mood for that, and this movie hit the spot last Friday night.  From a cinematography stand point the movie is beautiful.  Redford is known for this trait, and indeed has directed some of the most beautiful movies ever made (A River Runs Through It, The Milagro Beanfield War, The Horse Whisperer).  He just chooses some very beautiful scenery and runs with it.  However, besides the scenery, the movie seemed to flow like a steady river.

A spoof western, definitely. That Lee Marvin should not have won the Oscar? No way. It is far more difficult to carry off a role in what is obviously a pastiche than to excel in a serious dramatic part. Lee Marvin plays it to perfection. Watch his face in the bar scene in the hole in the wall, desperately trying to catch the moment to propose a toast - ""I'll drink to that!"". It's brilliant. This film has to be watched in the context of its time. It is no good trying to compare it to today's special effects dominated blockbusters or Pixar animations.

Basically it's obvious they decided that this trend of vulgar ""romantic"" comedies (i.e. American Pie) are bound to cash in so they'll just come up with a bunch of vulgar stuff, throw them together in a mixed bag of rail-thin ""plot"", add in a big name star (Kate Hudson, totally wasted in this) then spew out the result on movie screens and start counting money. Well this movie is going to flop big time, mark my words. When a movie is this bad it will not do well. Word of mouth is more important than I think studios realize, and this movie will not get much of that, if any at all. Advance reviews are atrocious and they should be. This abortion of a movie is one of the biggest wastes of an hour and a half I've ever experienced. Special mention to Dane Cook's completely hammy and painfully unfunny performance. He's trying so hard that it's sad, not delivering even one laugh, and the preview screening I saw was PACKED. It was noticeably silent throughout save for a few embarrassed giggles/immature teenagers laughing loudly at some of the pointless vulgar parts. Isn't Dane Cook's fifteen minutes up yet?

Parents who take kids to see any movie need to be aware of something: if it's rated PG there are likely going to be scenes that your six year old will not enjoy -- even if the name Disney is attached to it. The cutesy versions of A Christmas Carol (The Muppet Christmas Carol and Disney's own Mickey's Christmas Carol for example) have little in common with the classic, and sometimes very scary Charles Dickens story. The plot should be familiar to just about anyone who has been alive sometime during the past 150 years, and the fact that there are spirits (ghosts) in the story should also be a red flag to parents. Especially since two of them are downright frightening in just about any version of the story.The truth is that this is one of the most beautiful and faithful remakes of the Dickens classic. The dialogue is taken nearly word-for-word from the book, and the look and feel of the film brilliantly capture what you would imagine wintertime in London in the 19th century to be like. A few of the special effects are a bit over-the-top, but most work well and add enough pizazz for cynical modern-day audiences. The scenes featuring the Ghost of Christmas Present are worth the price of admission alone.Once every few months I'm dragged kicking and screaming to see a new film.

Not that I care much; they do not dominate those of his films that I like. Unfortunately for me, that trend persists, as I didn't get my fix of either spooks, wows, wits or laughs from Maps to the Stars.I felt detached all along. I didn't feel anything, apart from being annoyed by a few characters and a slapping desire. Here are a few reasons for this disconnection: .* It's all about Hollywood celebrities. One of the most exposed, yet least interesting microcosms on the planet. Meh.* There are a lot of useless scenes, usually dragging out vapid conversations.* Meanwhile, central characters are kept in the background. They may later become tragically pivotal, but we don't care by then; we don't even know them. Was that bad editing or just bad scripting ? .* Creepiness never takes. That's embarrassing because Mr Cronenberg had always excelled at this. Here, his ghosts and hallucinations have no impact. They may even be a tad ridiculous.Basically, the story doesn't flow and the emotions don't cross the screen. The cast is mostly fine. J. Moore has demonstrated time and again that she embodies the definition of an actress, i.e., an exhibitionist. No doubt her farting on a crapper will be praised by European critics.Best are the two kids, but in fairness they have more material to work with. The boy has a face that screams ""slap me!"", and the urge becomes irrepressible as soon as he opens his mouth, but thanks to some serious scenes and an adequate delivery, my nerves are later soothed in his presence. Almost.The girl, I had already seen elsewhere, in different registers. Here she is both spirited and delicate. Her character is out of a mental institute, yet she is the sanest of the lot. I suspect she was supposed to bring a subtle aura of menace, but I'm not sure. I bet Cronenberg isn't sure either. He got lost between his story and his private jokes.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MjQwNzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY3NDQ5MzE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Many viewers of now and then seemed to be disturbed by its lack of evident meaning or message. Starting more or less like a gangster flick, it abruptly turns halfway through into a psychedelic trip, where Mick Jagger appears, in one of his rare screen roles, as a retired rock star. No doubt, ""Performance"" doesn't do much effort to be easily understood. If you like stories with a clear plot, well defined characters and a happy ending, then skip this one. In order to enjoy that movie, you should better give up your rationality for a while. There are many interpretations one can have about it, but they will most likely come in the second run. Like a dream, ""Performance"" is a visual and mental shock where nothing comes as expected, and it lets you wake up dazed and confused by its so peculiar atmosphere. What I find most puzzling about it is how far ahead of its time this movie was in every aspect. It was shot in 1968, but released only two years later because the distributors were obviously not prepared for this kind of ""performance"", and had not seen anything alike before. Western society was undergoing incredibly fast and drastic mutations, and the culture shock that happened in those days is at the very heart of the picture. It was ""time for a change"". Just like the main character, the western world would never be the same again afterwards.Interesting fact : a mere five years before, the lead actor James Fox had played in ""the Servant"", a film based on a play by Harold Pinter with a story that has a lot in common with ""Performance"". ""The Servant"" appeared highly controversial by then because of its allusions to seedy sex, but it was shot in black and white with very conventional filming, editing and acting, and a very outdated jazzy soundtrack. Hard to believe it takes place in the same city (London) with the same lead actor within just a five year gap.Nothing about ""Performance"" is conventional. It takes off immediately into a hectic pace, flashy colors, haunting music, and very graphic sex and violence. The London crime world is photographed with a rare accuracy. Actually, one of the guys playing the gangsters happened to be a real life gangster. Then suddenly, by a random twist of fate, the cockney villain (no heroes here) is propelled into another completely different underground scene, where ""nothing is true, everything is permitted"". He meets his alter ego as a has-been pop musician living secluded in a red-walled mansion covered with mirrors, together with a duet of intriguing women. Hallucinogenic mushrooms are casually served at breakfast, notions of time and space fade away, while gender, identity and truth get blurred. The two main characters gradually merge together and though both of them seemingly get doomed by their fate in the end, you don't know by then which of them is whom anymore.I don't know of any other movie where you see a Rolls Royce burning down in an acid bath, gangsters performing a strip-tease show, or a plunging view inside a skull as a bullet is shot through it, least all of them together. Besides, the recurring use of mirrors all throughout the picture, the constant play with colors and the superimposing of faces and images don't have many parallels either in film history. Of course, if you are a Rolling Stones fan, this movie is a must-see, but then you probably have seen it already. Like the main character, the Rolling Stones began as English street kids, and came to explore a world of sex, drugs and rock&roll where one of them actually lost his life. In ""Performance"" , an androgynous long-haired Mick Jagger with pouting lips is at the acme of his character, while blond and foxy Anita Pallenberg, who had affairs with three members of the band, and freckled boyish MichÃÂ¨le Breton fit perfectly into the scenery .If there was to be a ""pop-art"" movie, that would be it. You may love or hate this film, but for sure, it is daringly creative and experimental, and anything but ordinary. To quote the character played by Jagger : ""the only performance that makes it, that really makes it, is the one that achieves madness"".","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2VhNTdlM2QtNGZkNy00Y2U3LTkzNzctNTFiZDAzYTk4YzY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

A fifth grade drama class could write and direct a more entertaining film. It took two writers to come up with a story that's been done thousands of times before, and all much better. The story was so cliched, dull, generic, and predictable, and dragged out endlessly with horribly slow pacing and an uneventful narrative, that the normally comfortable runtime felt endless.At the halfway mark, I felt like I spent half a day binging a boring TV series. Then you have director Tom DeNucci manage to make the very few action scenes boring and cringeworthy, and he clearly failed to direct his cast properly, especially Tyrese Gibson, who looked and sounded bored and like he was falling asleep.

Human Traffic is going to upset the majority of film critics who will view the lack of plot, the drug induced dialogue and the futile outlook on Nineties Youth culture as a miserable and desperate view of how weekends are spent by ravers and clubheads across the UK. Moreover, they will spot camera work borrowed from Boogie Nights and even try and associate the whole film with 'Trainspotting' theme (because, lets face it, a Scottish Heroin addict trying to clean up his act and a Welsh clubber looking for a good time with his mates is pretty much the same thing, right?)Well wrong. Human Traffic has landed - along with one and a half quality hours of clubs, drugs, pubs and parties - and its time to leave behind your preconceptions of what a film should be like (where's the plot? I want a plot!) and instead delve into the lives of Jip (John Simm) and his mates, Nina (Nicola Reynolds), Koop (Shaun Parkes), Lulu (Lorraine Pilkington) and Moff (Danny Dyer). There's nothing special about these five friends; they're just hanging out together and showing you the way they lead their lives. They are not Burger King. They certainly don't do it your way. And you don't like it - well, tough.Because essentially this period piece has captured everything that Nineties youth culture is revolving around. There are no clear solutions, in fact very few problems in the first place. At the end of the day, what Jip and his friends are doing is living and who are we to know or comment on anything different? They drink, smoke dope, pop pills and party; they know the risks and they're prepared to take them and moralists will just have to sit back and (try to) enjoy the ride.The sound track is terrific and accompanies the highs and lows of the 48 hour weekend and the events that take place in it. But within this, what first appears to be social unity, we see traces of individual isolation that are easy to bypass in a culture of hedonism. Jips paranoia of sex, Koops jealous possession of Nina and Moff as his drug habit digs him deeper into his own hole and further away from his family, asks the question 'are things really this good?' However they will not be exaggerated to the extent that they are conspicuous, giving the film a controversial stance on drugs and the role in social integration. Kerrigan is pulling no punches. And why should he? This isn't GO! or any other such American rave film with clear cut margins and please-the-crowd conclusions - it is one that forces us to question whilst at the same time enjoy the at times hilarious, touching and other times exciting events of 48 hours with a group of five 'friends'.And for the die-hard British youth among you, this might not be reality - but it's a bloody brave effort at depicting it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZlMjIxZjgtZGJiMC00ODAwLWJhNWYtYWJkZDg2Y2VkM2QyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA0MzYwMDY@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The movie has its roots in several great film noir projects, such as ""Double Indemnity"", ""The Killers"", ""Criss Cross"", and ""Out of the Past"". Its lasting impression over time is based upon its quality and its unprecedentedly brilliant use of the ""caper"" as a plot device. As stated in other comments, this film noir's influence can be seen in hundreds of disparate ""caper"" movies - ""Rififi"", ""A Simple Plan"", ""The Guns of Navarone"", ""The Usual Suspects"", and ""How to Steal a Million"", just to name a few. I will not give away the results of the ""caper"", but the film is truly superior in how it explores relationships and deception. This is one of John Huston's greatest works, and the script lays down the tension from the first moment and doesn't let up. Huston uses multiple closeups to literally drain the emotion out of the characters. Hayden, Calhern, Lawrence, Hagen, and Whitmore turn in superb performances with many memorable moments, but Sam Jaffe steals the film in an Oscar-worthy performance as the brain behind the caper. Marilyn Monroe makes an indelible impression in a fairly brief but pivotal role.Please do not miss this - an easy 10 out of 10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWYxNWZjZmEtOTk1Ny00ZWE0LWI1YjAtZmQ0ZjM4OGUwNmJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Well, at least, that's how it looks in movies. We've seen Katniss Everdeen and Tris Prior lead powerful rebellions against their respective ironfisted governments, Clary Fray battle demons and supernaturals, and Jupiter Jones get crowned as the cosmic queen. I mean, from becoming mere sexual objects for playboy billionaires, they've gone as far as being the supreme leader of the universe, what else can these women do just so they could equate themselves with men? What about as an international assassin?In Barely Lethal, 16 year-old Megan Walsh (not her real name) is a trained international assassin. This premise already engages interest and holds so much potential, but it fails to deliver a satisfying result. The problem begins when Megan leaves the academy where little girls are trained to become assassins. She fakes her death and enrolls herself in a suburban highschool, hoping everything is going to be normal. Only it turns out it isn't as easy as it seems. From here, the trajectory of the narrative disappoints immensely. It begins undermining the capacity of its lead character by dismissing the fact that she is a trained killer, exposing her vulnerabilities and teenage dramas, instead. This isn't a totally a insane idea, she's 16-year old, after all. But getting further dragged by bland one liners and intertwining subplots, makes it even worse. Eventually, in the wake of its competing concerns, it loses grip of its own direction and struggles to arrive to a decent endpoint. It also doesn't succeed tapping the utmost otential of its strong supports by not giving them enough material to work with. Jessica Alba and Samuel Jackson barely do something here, though there may be some little moments with their presence, that aren't really devoid of wit. Almost everything just falls flat, and the comic effort couldn't provide any aid, either, to redeem its sagging narrative.By the time the movie is already fast approaching its finale, it isn't any more surprise if Megan never came close to any of those heroines mentioned earlier, and it really disappoints that she never really came to be someone interesting, either. Well, you may want to blame that to her unconvincing chemistry (not saying there's any) with both her love interests, and a boring villain whose presence may have only really felt during the last action sequence of the movie.BARELY LETHAL wastes almost every promising attribute it has to live up to its overwhelming potential. In the end, it abandons what could be a unique take on the young espionage genre, and sets itself taking the leads of countless others it seems to emulate. The result is barely fulfilling.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MzYyMjI1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE0Mzg2NTE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I have followed this movie's journey since 2018 and it was surreal to sit and finally enjoy this story, made so beautifully and with so much love.Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe is tender and real. It doesn't only show the characters, it sees them. It is gorgeously constructed with dreamy cinematography by Akis Konstantakopoulos, and a beautiful soundtrack to match. Max and Reese truly understood their characters. They captured the quirks, the deadpan jokes, and the mannerisms of teenage boys figuring themselves out. They are awkward, they are silly, they are young. They don't know who they are and they piece it together on screen, in small stumbles and in leaps. They are the perfect representations of Aristotle and Dante.It is written with love, it is filmed with love, it is directed with love. After watching for the second time in one night, with a headache from crying, I felt like love had been given back to me, too. When a story is so beautiful, it demands to be seen over and over, and this is one of those. It feels like a huge, crushing, beautiful hug.

A feature film which presents deleted scenes fromTwin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me(1992) assembled together for the first time in an untold portion of the story's prequel.","20","A collection of deleted scenes that should not have been deleted.","The Missing Pieces is a collection of never-before-seen scenes from Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, the divisive prequel to the television series Twin Peaks. This feature length edit, put together by David Lynch himself, is almost like a second Twin Peaks movie. It is a chance to get some new scenes with beloved characters from the show, starts to explain some of what David Lynch was going for with the movie, and even has some scenes taking place after the end of the TV show. I actually enjoyed it more than the film it was cut from.First of all are the additional scenes of the investigation at the start of Fire Walk With Me. These are mostly a curiosity item, a lot of them being no more than extended scenes. There is a pretty good fight scene in there. The most interesting part of this first 30 minutes is the scene with David Bowie's Agent Phillip Jeffries. In the movie, this came out of nowhere and went nowhere. You couldn't even hear what was going on half of the time due to the editing. Here, we can see a clean version of the scene, and it begins to explain some things. It's still a big mystery, but there are some new pieces.Then we get to the main event. The Twin Peaks staples. There are lovely scenes with Norma and Ed, Bobby's parents, and a hilarious one with Josie, Pete, and an Old Man. That scene felt most like one from the show.One of the main problems with the movie is that it shows us nothing but the dark, abusive side of the Palmer family, meaning we don't really get a chance to invest in the characters, so we don't care when devastating things happen to them. That's why the initial dinner scene from this edit is the most crucial scene that should have stayed in the movie. It shows us the Palmer family as a quirky yet functional and happy family, masking some darkness underneath. If they had kept this scene in the movie, it would have humanized them, meaning it actually means something when we see them dehumanized throughout the movie.At the end, we see a scene with Annie from after the end of the show and an extended version of the show's final scene. Neither scene solves the massive cliffhanger the series was left on (""How's Annie?""), but they make it more intricate, tying in aspects from the movie plot.In the end, this is a must see for Twin Peaks fans, even ones who didn't enjoy the movie. It provides new scenes in the style of the show, illuminates the thinking behind some of the movie's odd choices, and even provides more information about the massive cliffhanger from the end of the show.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNkYTk4MDMtNTFiYi00ZTNlLWFmNjAtYTUxYjAwZmExOTkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI0Nzk5NTQ2._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

What kind of crappy coach and crappy team never puts the second string in, even when they are leading by 40 points? The muddled point of the movie seemed to be that winning wasn't the most important part of playing the game. For me, this scene blew that ideal out of the water.

A large number of Americans seem to be unplugged in some fundamental way. Soul-less. This movie restores a little (very little) of my faith in my fellow McDonald's eaters.

While swimming beneath the stars and with tales of ghosts, invitations to parties, impossible dares, challenges to face fears, humor, sexual tension, and acts of courage and defiance, Bastien is beguiled by Chloe. She takes him into underworlds around him as well as inside himself, that he never knew existed. He feels on top of the world and also like he is going under.""You have to be intelligent to find others intelligent,"" said director Charlotte Le Bon who appeared at this Toronto International Film Festival screening of her debut feature film with one of its stars (Sara Montpetit, who plays Chloe). This enthralling teenage romance and boreal forest cabin inspired tale really resonate with me because I had similar experiences. Chloe is the type of girl I repeatedly fell for in my life, and I treasure a similarly situated cabin in Canada. In Falcon Lake the parents have a peripheral role. The story revolves around Bastien's point of view, and I find that interesting and refreshingly different from mainstream films that focus more on parents. Music is used sparsely and with powerful effect. The acting, sound, photography, dialogue, and everything else all come together so well. Falcon Lake feels authentic and assured. We will see more from Charlotte and Sara in the future. Falcon Lake first appeared at Cannes and is based on a graphic novel by Bastien Vives.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDIyMzBjZGUtZTMxNi00OWZkLTg4MTEtNThmZDhhNzA4MTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAyMjQ3NzQ1._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In fact, Song of the South presents some of the least offensive portraits of African Americans you can find from the time. If you really need to compare, go find any other film starring Hattie McDaniel ÃÂ start with Gone With the Wind ÃÂ and note how much more dignity she has in the Disney movie. Uncle Remus (James Baskett, who is utterly, utterly exceptional) is perhaps the most charming character you'll find. He's much more stereotypical of an elderly man than a black man. A smart man with strong morals and a clever way of delivering them, he seems to see things more clearly than anyone else in the film. No, Uncle Remus is a kind man who loves humanity, and this love is infectious. The movie made me very happy to be alive. A more politically correct version of the film would have him rebelling against white society with violence. It's kind of sad that we can't abide blacks and whites actually getting along, preaching brotherhood. The live action bits are very good (although I think Bobby Driscoll is a bit weak in the lead), but it is the animated pieces (and the live action/animation sequences) that make Song of the South great. Br'er Rabbit, Fox, and Bear are wonderful characters, and these three segments represent some of the best animation Disney ever did. The mixed scenes are amazing (was this the first time it was done?). I especially liked when Uncle Remus went fishing with Br'er Frog. Uncle Remus lights his pipe with an animated flame, and blows an animated smoke ring that turns into a square (which is, of course, also politically incorrect). I suspect that the biggest reason this film stirs so many negative emotions is the black dialect used in the film. I think that bugs people a lot. Really, though, blacks from the rural South have and have had their own accents and ways of speaking just as they have and have had in any other region. While the accents in this film are somewhat fabricated, I'm sure, I think that it would be a far cry to think of them as harmful to anybody. The hurt that people feel over this movie is the real fabrication, induced by PC thugs who seem to want to cause rifts between peoples. I think that a re-release of Song of the South could possibly have a beneficial effect on race relations in the United States, as it does depict dear friendships and respect between the races, something that I think we quite need at the moment.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU3ZTgzMjQtZDBhMS00ZmRlLTliM2ItOTE1MmEzOWRkZTIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzY1NDgwNjQ@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Aging may bring wisdom, (well, at least to some) but it also brings a whole new array of problems; problems that cannot be understood by those outside of a highly specific age range. There may be some communication between generations. We can learn from both those who have gone before us and those younger than us, but this learning is more at the intellectual than emotional level. Thirty-five-year-old Jesse (Josh Radnor) is introduced to classical music by 19-year-old Zibby (Elizabeth Olsen) but their perspectives on life challenge their chances to unite in a more personal way.The film, in some ways, is like the Canterbury Tales (which is mentioned in the movie), only instead of traveling to a city while relating different tales, the characters are traveling through life with different perspectives. We have youthful optimism and idealism, age with its cynicism and bitterness, and middle-age with its realism. There are also perspectives from mysticism and despair. This is more of a psychological movie than an action movie. Although I never lost interest in the story, I am well-aware that this is not what most younger moviegoers are looking for and it is they who will be disappointed in this film. So be it. When today's hottest action films are replaced by those which have better special effects, films like Liberal Arts will endure because they will stand on their own merits, outside of time.I found the acting good and the screenplay excellent. The interaction between the characters was believable. I cannot imagine anyone other than the writer, Josh Radnor, playing the main role. He plays the part of a man trapped by middle-aged angst to perfection. However, this is not simply a dry intellectual drama. There is a good deal of humor, some great lines, but it is humor that is witty more than physical.As a classical music fan myself, I liked seeing Jesse discover this genre. I also liked the scene where Jesse tries to bridge the generation gap mathematically, but I can't say more about that here. In short, this is an enjoyable movie, but those looking for goofball comedies or bloody fight scenes should go onto something else. Don't worry. This film will still be around for you to discover when you are ready for it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDRlN2Y5ZDItYTJjMC00NDNlLWIzM2YtNWMxMzhlNWRjMjIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyNDQ2NjI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's not intelligent, the acting isn't anything special and the plot is sub-par. But it's hilarious, and as a snowboarder wildly entertaining. I watch it in the summer when I miss the season, in the fall when I'm waiting for the season, in the winter when I'm NOT snowboarding, and in the spring when the season is ending. There is so much truth to the movie in some aspects that it just feels right. The movie is so funny in so many little ways, and if you open your mind and are willing to accept it for what it is, I think you'll love it as well. It has a great soundtrack featuring a LOT of Jack Johnson, some Weezer, Sum 41, other stuff, all of which is good. Jason London is great as Rick Rambis, Zach Galifinakis is hilarious as Luke and whoever plays Pigpen does a great job of acting dumber then you would think anyone could actually be.

Enviromental enthusiast?  Insane eco-warrior?  Or both?Gorillas In The Mist is the story of this extraordinary woman whose work with Mountain Gorillas in Congo, and subsequently Rwanda, quite possibly saved these beautiful creatures from extinction.  Her hard work and determination in studying these wonderful animals led to an amazing living arrangement with them.How simply amazing must it be to touch, play and hold hands with a silverback Gorilla in the wilds of Africa?  How would it feel to find that same silverback with his head, hands and feet cut off by poachers? To be frank, these gorillas were Dian Fossey's children - each had a name, each had their own unique trait - so it is hardly surprising that she became a little possessive and started treating the animals as her own.  The horrors that she experienced on those mountains would send anyone mad.Sigourney Weaver is simply superb as Fossey, portraying her hard work and gradual decline into insanity with that touch that only a few actresses possess.  Her chemistry with co-star Bryan Brown adds to the feel of the film and the fact that she was brave enough to go anywhere near real gorillas is fascinating.  To be fair, the two hours do drag a little, but Weaver is talented enough to carry the film through it.Weaver once said ""I only get the parts that Meryl [Streep] passes up"" but to be honest, I couldn't imagine this brilliant woman being played by anyone else but Sigourney.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTZhZmVkNzUtNGE0MC00ZmNlLWJkMzMtYThkNjBmNmZhYmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UY209_CR6,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

For example, the Easter Bunny rides a sleigh! Is that all they could come up with!? Also, I would say the voice cast are much better than the live action cast, and James Marsden does not make a particularly convincing out of work slacker.But apart from that, Hop is a fun family film, and I would recommend this a lot!Also, I think the critics are completely wrong!

At first everything seems a bit messy (various threads seemingly insignificant) but then the plot gets poignant though a little oppressive. Acting performances are affecting and strong (especially Charlize Theron), the tone is progressively melodramatic.

Every other week we are tortured with some nonsense of this calibre and whenever I wish for a movie that stands out from the crowd I have to go back in time and consider some overlooked gem. The Boy Who Could Fly is exactly that.The characters seem so real and their emotions genuine, it builds at a slow pace but it never gets boring and story development is consistent. This is not a ferociously loud summer crowd-pleaser or something bloated with pointless SFX. Very few movies have the power to make a whole story out of characters and situation alone without feeling the need for some ridiculous set piece or blaring thrash metal guitars.In fact Bruce Broughton's score is the wonderful opposite of that. The performances, especially the two leads, are flawless and the direction is far more refined than the typical. Everything in this movie comes together perfectly to make a film so unique and charming.

I honestly don't know what the point of it all was. Even the big bad network anchor-another disappointing female character-made me roll my eyes every second she was onscreen because she and everything around her were just so unbelievable.

Although I am in the distinct minority, I didn't particularly like KAGEMUSHA. Yes, it was big and beautiful and had great scope but it was also emotionally sterile and bore little resemblance to Kurosawa's earlier, more famous works. The same, by the way, can be said about RAN. Both films had relatively HUGE budgets but the dialog and connectedness between the characters was lacking. As a result, I felt pretty bored when I watched both of them--especially this film. So, if you compare these two movies with THE 7 SAMURAI or YOJIMBO, for example, they seem VERY different. These older films, though not filmed in color, had a greater sense of humanity about them--great importance was placed on the INTERRELATIONSHIPS between the characters AND the camera work was very different, with more closeups and a more intimate feel. So, while RAN and KAGEMUSHA were pretty to look at, I felt much more detached from them and cared much less about the characters. I really think the problem with these two movies, and the reason I like them less than the average Kurosawa film, was that the big budget in these later films actually HURT them, as too much emphasis was placed on effects and dialog was purely secondary.So, in summary, I am the odd-ball that didn't love this film. You will probably disagree and might be tempted to mark my review as ""not helpful"", as the reviews on IMDb are generally glowing. But having seen many Japanese films, I can't help but feel there are better films out there waiting to be seen. Most any other Kurosawa film, and films by other great directors (such as THE SAMURAI TRILOGY, the films of Yasujiro Ozu) are more appealing to me. I think the popularity of this film is in part due to its having been seen in theaters by more Westerners than any other of Kurosawa's films--SEEK OUT HIS EARLIER AND MID-CAREER FILMS--they are better and far more emotionally involving.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjk4NzAwYTgtZTdmNi00NDI3LWJkNjAtNmQ2MGU5NmUzMWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I highly enjoyed this original story and concept and thought that it was perfectly executed by talented director Nicholas Meyer, who made his debut as a director with this movie. After this he made two more well known and widely appreciated Star Trek movies; ""Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan"" and ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"" which by the fans are often regarded as the best in the series of Star Trek movies. The movie has a fantastic and typical '70's atmosphere which I always adore in movies. It's also filled with some typical '70's tense chase sequences, which are brilliantly filmed and edited. The cinematography itself is also at times refreshingly original, especially the perfectly done opening sequence of the movie in which Jack The Ripper makes another victim. But the movie isn't just tense and original, it also is highly entertaining and it features some good humor. Of course having an 19th century main character who for the first time takes a look in the future 1979 is already good for some laughs. Such as the time were he visits a McDonald's or comes up with the fake alias Sherlock Holmes when he gets in contact with the police. There are countless 'little' fun parts like this in the movie which makes this movie a pleasant and entertaining one to watch as well as a tense nail biting thriller.Malcolm McDowell is extremely good and convincing as a 19th century gentleman and scientist H.G. Wells. Honestely he plays his best role since ""A Clockwork Orange"". David Warner is also perfectly cast as Jack The Ripper. He's a perfectly scary and mysterious gentleman. Warner is perhaps well known to everyone for playing Spicer Lovejoy in the 1997 movie ""Titanic"". The movie also features a at the time still very young Mary Steenburgen in one of her very first movie roles. She also was superb and the talent was already showing. One year later she even already won an Oscar for the movie ""Melvin and Howard"".The movie further more features a highly good and underrated musical score by well known Hungarian composer MiklÃÂ³s RÃÂ³zsa. This movie is terribly underrated in terms of how well known it is. This movie deserves to be seen by everybody for this movie is an entertaining one as well as a tense thriller, with some excellent performances by the cast and good directing by Nicholas Meyer.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwMTJmZGYtOWQyMS00NzE4LThiNTctYTU5ZTcwNDQ4MzExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Director Niki Caro has done wonders in bringing this story to the screen as it shows a different and much simple world than the rat race of our society and the horrible times we live in.The film presents a glimpse of the Maori society in New Zealand's North Island. Having visited New Zealand, but not being very familiar with the Maori culture, this film was a refreshing way to learn some aspects of it.The story presented here has a lot to do with pride and tradition, which is a running theme among different cultural groups the world over. It has to do with the frustration of Koro by the defection of his eldest son, the designated heir of hundred years of a bloodline where only the males can carry the knowledge and the legends from one generation to the next.Because of the rage Porourangi, the eldest son, feels after the death of his wife giving birth to twins, where only the female survives, he leaves his country and the baby girl is taken by the grandparents. The girl, Pai, will grow to be an enchanting girl who will be excluded from the teachings of her grandfather Koro. Even though he loves the girl, he can't deviate in his narrow vision of the world he knows.Basically, it is a simple story very well told with a great performance by the child actress Keisha Castle-Hughes. This girl has such a strong magnetism while on camera that one tends to forget the rest of the other characters every time she appears. The grandparents are very well portrayed by Rawiri Paratene and Vicky Houghton. This is a film for all ages to enjoy. Compare it with the latest releases from Hollywood, and it's no wonder to arrive at the conclusion that stories like Whale Rider have such an universal appeal that  should be brought to the screen more often because of the positive way they show a society and its people at its best.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3MzE2OTEwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTkyMTg4NA@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Now three teenagers - one human, one vampire, and one zombie - have to team up to figure out how to get rid of the visitors.","45","Nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is","Mixing zombies, vampires, and aliens sounded cool enough. With Patton Oswalt, Bob Odenkirk, Denis Leary, Keegan-Michael Key, and Werner Herzog, one would think this could be a really funny movie. Instead, those really funny people all play relatively small roles and we are mostly left with a trio of unfunny heroes plodding around the film.The town has zombies and vampires mixing in society, mostly at a high school, and none of that ever gets a back story. Attempts at wild comedy don't need to explain too much, especially if it would interfere with the jokes. But this wild comedy never gets wild enough, and it is nowhere near as clever as it portrays itself. Is it really all that funny to kill people around you and then act like it was NBD?There are funny moments, but not enough LOLz. There also seems to be some attempt at a morality play about classism or racism, as we see humans vs. zombies vs. vampires. Vampire-on-zombie crime is most assuredly despicable, and we should all get along.This vague social commentary gets mixed with the eternal story font: High School is Tough For Everyone, Even the Popular People. If you don't want to feel, you don't have to: just go be a zombie. If you want to be cool, be a vampire. Whatever you do, just make sure everyone sees, so you can make the scene.It's a bad sign when Ed Westwick has the best performance in a movie. Nicholaus Braun rattles off his lines like he can't wait to get to the bar. Mackenzie Davis, however, puts in a sincere performance and is a star-to-be.Freaks of Nature is neither clever enough, funny enough, gross enough, nor serious enough to be much of anything in particular. Even the smooth and dulcet tones of Werner Herzog's voice do little to step up the scene. This is no Cabin in the Woods.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MTMyMTEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE0MDYwNzE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He's absolutely marvelous as playboy Nickie Ferrante, who finds himself falling quickly in love with someone other than his fiancee.  I have never seen chemistry on screen like this!

But there are some scenes that just absolutely take your breath away... like when they are visiting Nickie's grandmother (in my opinion, the point that they realize their deep love for each other).  Also, when they meet their fiancees in New York and while Terry's hugging Ken, Nickie gently kisses his fingertips and places them on her glove, and then she holds her glove to her cheek.  Truly divine. However, the defining moment of this film (believe me, you better have some hankies handy!) is at the end... the look on Grant's face whenever he sees the portrait is PRICELESS.  And of course, Kerr's voice trembling at the words ""Darling, don't look at me like that.""

This one definitely does. From the first minutes of the film, you know that you're in for a thrilling adventure. Alex Rider, played superbly by Alex Pettyfer, is very believable as a school kid thrown into the deep end by Bill Nighy who hams it up brilliantly as spymaster Alan Blunt. Alex Rider is a deadly weapon on two legs as you'll see as the film progresses. Marvellous Micky Rourke, plays the evil villain who keeps a very unusual and deadly pet and looks as if he's just stepped off the set of a Revlon ad (you'll see!!). There's lots of action, some love interest, but that's not overplayed and although some of the evil characters look as if they've been loaned out from Cirque Du Soleil, including Micky Rourke, they play their parts as they should be, comically but with a twist of evil thrown in. It all works very well but Alex Pettyfer is a revelation. He plays the part coolly, calmly and with a great deal of conviction. I think Sean Connery would be proud of him. The film throws in a few James Bondesque clichÃÂ©s and there is one scene in the film which will remind you of a particular person from Goldfinger !! All in all highly enjoyable, my 11 year old niece and 14 year old nephew and their friends really enjoyed it and I think you will too.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwODY1NzAzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODUxNDc3._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Whilst the second one used Stallone and Batista for a poster and credit only to suck you in, it was a vehicle for Asian market with Asian stars. With a more competent direct on John Herzfeld on the third, there's a noted improvement. First Stallone gets about 40 minutes of screen time, whilst he barely got 10 minutes in the second one, there's still great fights for Max Zhang to shine, but Stallone gets more to do here, 50 cent is in it for 2 minutes (always a bonus) and Bautista is the Terry Crews of Expendables, big guy with the big gun, gets a few minutes to shine. HIghights include the career resurgence of Martial Arts Action Star Daniel Bernhardt gets a great end fight with Max Zhang and Stallone gets brutal with Devon Sawa 90s heartthrob from the Final Destination movies. Overall, a vast improvement on number 2, nowhere near as good as the original, but we get fights, we get blood and we get Stallone kicking but here and there. It's easy to see why he's established Balboa Pictures in his twilight years and doesnt want to get caught doing these sequels and Backtrace style films for a quick payday. He cares more about his career than a Cage or Travolta or Bruce Willis at this point and doesnt want to do this for the pay cheque. Overall, starts bad and gets better and ends well.

It simply invites us into the characters' lives and lets us share them for a couple of hours. No judgment, no big overblown speeches, no hystrionics. No car crashes, no dead bodies, no funerals. No artifice, no heavy-handedness, no contrivances.

Not only is this one of the most acclaimed novels ever but it's one of the most controversial. The story is basically an origin tale for the infamous Batman villain, The Joker. When this movie was initially announced back at the beginning of 2016 there was some serious hype surrounding it. Especially when it received an R rating. One thing that really made me nervous though was how quickly this actually released. Obviously, it could've been in production long before it was announced back at the beginning of the year, but after seeing the film, I don't think that's the case.The first thirty minutes of the film is a kind of prelude involving, mostly, Batgirl. It talks about how she came to quit being said superhero and draws a thread between her and Batman. Now, this story is controversial for a reason. Not only does it explore tough themes but it shows the details of these horrible things. The story in the graphic novel is brutal, uncompromising, and pretty tough to get through.However the film is just the opposite. It tries hard to retell the story seen in the novel, yet any emotional drama is all but lost. This mainly has to do with the length of the film itself. Being only 80 minutes, it's rather short. As I said, the first thirty minutes revolves around Batgirl. And this segment of time is absolutely the worst to sit through. It's tedious, overly long, and so clichÃÂ© and predictable that there's nothing remotely enjoyable.While, this part of the film is undoubtedly the worst from a storytelling standpoint, there are a number of things that remained consistently bad throughout. Most notably was the animation. From a studio like Warner Bros you'd expect some decent art work, but not here. The back drops nor art design is well put together. It's clunky, with no style to be found.It looks like they took the animation from a rough draft of the animated series and colored it in. This issue becomes even more clear whenever it attempts 3D animation. The other blaring issue that continues through the film is the music. Which is completely contrived and formulated to the point of it being so clichÃÂ© that is, in fact not clichÃÂ©.As the film ended, a crowd that once cheered for the lights dimming, was left in stunned silence. Not a good stunned silence like you get after watching 'Gone Girl', this type of silence is the kind where people don't know what they just saw. For me, this had to do with the complete lack of any emotional resonance. When it attempts to recreate the power of the novel it fails. It doesn't commit enough to the drama of the story. Even with its R rating it doesn't draw the same toughness the novel does. It lacks the rawness that the novel has to make it's audience queasy. It's not graphic enough to be disturbing and it's not lighthearted enough to be fun. It just bounces from scene to scene with little connecting one to another. The best way to describe it is that it goes from this scene to that scene and than it ends. That's about it. Ã¢ÂÂThis is one film that should have been great. All the pieces are there. It has a great studio behind it, an excellent voice team, and a brilliant story. But it lacks the emotional power that the novel has. Even though it has its R rating it doesn't fully commit to it, or anything for that matter. Without coherent direction and the overall first draft vibe of the film it's hardly the experience we've been lead to believe it is.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTdjZTliODYtNWExMi00NjQ1LWIzN2MtN2Q5NTg5NTk3NzliL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

And the type of film that Scott Ryan has made is perfect for a low budget film, a gritty documentary style. Its a style that suits the budget and available equipment. Other than that, however, there's not much else.This film tries to give the impression that it is a documentary following in the footsteps of a Melbourne hit man named Ray Shoesmith as he goes about his business: killing people. The documentary maker Massimo Totti follows Shoesmith around asking question and filming murders.In one key scene that typifies the whole movie, Shoesmith and Totti are driving in a car at night through the Victorian countryside with a drug dealer in handcuffs locked in the boot of the car. Shoesmith and Totti are arguing about whether or not Clint Eastwood was in The Dirty Dozen. Shoesmith stops the car, opens the boot with gun in hand and asks the captive in the boot if Clint Eastwood is in the movie. This is basically what the entire film is about: showing a hit-man and his victims casually talking and discussing pointless and irreverent topics like their favourite cars, football players and what they want on their hamburgers. Other glib scenes involve Shoesmith telling Totti that he's not going to share a bed with him in a motel if he takes his pants off. Scenes like this, of meandering vacant ramblings, are given a large amount of time in the movie, and my guess is they're supposed to be funny scenes. Other lengthy scenes involve Totti asking Shoesmith how much money would he have to be paid before he would eat human excrement and why has he never been to the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. 85% of the film is made up of scenes like this and frankly it gets really boring.Scott Ryan gives a decent performance as Ray Shoesmith, but there is a problem which affects the whole movie. There are no characters or characterisations in this film. The characters are portrayed as superficially and rather clichÃÂ©d. There is no depth in this film whatsoever. In this ""documentary"" we never learn why Shoesmith is a hit-man, we never learn who he kills and why or how he feels about it, we never learn who he works for and we certainly never learn what makes him tick. All we get to find out about him is that he hasn't the slightest conscience of killing people (in fact the whole thing means very little to him) and he thinks he's rather funny. He indulges in inane chit chat about pointless topics. I think what Scott Ryan is trying to do here is make a joke, the one joke this film is about: a hit-man who is an average bloke who talks about mundane things.Unfortunately it fails on almost all fronts. In fact, its the worst aspects of 3 different types of cinema. It's not particularly funny, it doesn't work as a 'documentary' because you learn nothing slightly interesting or fascinating about the characters nor do you gain any insight when you see them or him in action, and the acting is so unnatural that it comes across in some parts as a bad improvisation game, it doesn't work as a gangster film because the majority of the film is spent on dull conversation.This film is called the Magician because obviously like Shoesmith's dead bodies (which you never see but he does talk about) he makes things disappear, however a Hit Man knows how to hit his target, something this film certainly failed to do.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzkwZGFhNmYtMzlmNi00NzMxLTg1NTMtNzhjNjQwNjdlYjI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDgyNzAxMzY@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Sarah Winchester's father manufactured decorative architectural features for Victorian houses, and his factory was right next door to her childhood home -- so Sarah grew up intimately exposed to the physical details of building houses. As an educated rich woman, building her house was an expensive hobby she loved and could afford to pursue. She also incorporated the newest technology - elevators, showers, etc. - into the house, and managed a productive fruit orchards and a dried fruit business, and . I thought the movie did a good job of including some factual information based on the real Sarah Winchester, and accurately portrayed her as responsible, not crazy, and deeply caring for her family, As for the lurid sensational haunted house story, this was concocted by those who bought the house after Sarah Winchester died, and turned it into a money-making tourist trap. That said, I enjoyed this fictional ghost story, which explored deeper themes than I would normally expect from a supernatural horror genre flick. There does seem to be a heavy handed message about gun violence -- however, I agree with that message; it's more than timely..","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2OWE5OGItMTE4Yi00ZmIzLThjZDctNTU1OTMxMTc3Yjg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4NTM5NDY@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

""We walk in, we put him down, we walk out,"" muses Marvin distractedly on the train back to Chicago.  Cassavettes had the chance to run but didn't, and Marvin wants to know why.Initially, Don Siegel's colour remake of the Ernest Hemingway story was intended as the first made-for-TV movie.  Vetoed by the network for its amoral viewpoint and violence, it was released in cinemas and quickly became a cult 1960s B-movie.Anonymous and menacing in executive suits, sunglasses and briefcase, Marvin and scene-stealing Gulager memorably personify organised crime under Siegel's expert direction.  They're pure all-American evil.True, the main plot - pieced together in flashback as the two hitmen track down the mail robbery gang led by Ronald Reagan (his last film) - is pretty routine stuff.  But even that serves to heighten the threat represented by Marvin and Gulager, as they unravel the real reason for Cassavettes' deathwish.""No one ever knows what we're talking about,"" mocks Gulager when femme fatale Angie Dickinson tries to act dumb.  The scene in the hotelroom where the killers force her to tell is handled with a ferocious cool that is Siegel's trademark.The Killers was still in production when Kennedy was assassinated - perhaps one reason, given its theme,  why TV network ABC pulled it from their 1964 schedule.  The scene where Gulager is shot down on a sunlit sidewalk even echoed the killing of Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald (Gulager's character is called Lee).OK, it's not a masterpiece.  Even the great Don Siegel can't quite disguise a B-movie budget, a repetitious screenplay, brightly artificial colour, and exteriors that are only too obviously the Universal backlot.  But it is tense and exciting, thanks to Siegel's authoritative grasp of the genre.""I shot it in the style which I think is my style at its best,"" Siegel concluded later. ""Very taut and lean with great economy.  If I had to do it over again, I don't think I would change much.""","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODRmM2Y5NGItMTU2Ny00NTM3LWJiOTEtOGRkNTE1NjQ1MzYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc5NjEzNA@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Author!","I am usually annoyed by films based on novels about novelists. Really, it's like the author couldn't think of anything else to write about. `Write what you know.'  That's what the writing instructors tell you. But a novel about a writer makes it seem like writing is all you know. Who, except other writers, would want to read it?  The opening scenes of Wonder Boys, however, buried whatever hang-ups I had.  This story is less about writing than it is about the tortured souls that produce it.This film is a departure from anything I've seen before. Really, has there ever been another major studio movie set in Pittsburgh? It's about time. Here's another departure: Wonder Boys triumphs as a character study. How many comedies can claim this? And a great comedy it is. Who can't appreciate the fact that one of the most important characters driving the story is a blind dog that's locked in a car trunk for most of the movie? Not to be upstaged by said dog, Michael Douglas turns in his best performance since Wall Street. Douglas plays the ultimate tortured soul, Grady Tripp, a much-respected, award-winning, and soon-to-be divorced University of Pittsburgh writing prof, wrestling as many artists do with a novel that refuses to end. One of his students, James Leer (Tobey Maguire in his best performance ever), is trying his hardest to be a poor, struggling artist and is looking to be inspired. James all but cons his way into Grady's life and the scenes between these two crackle with life. James has his own novel he's finished, and Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey, Jr.), believes he's found a true `wonder boy,' the next big thing. The film then dangles these questions in front of us: How will Grady find a balance between helping James, fulfilling James' expectations of his hero, and dealing with the fact that this kid is On The Verge while he himself is on page 1163 and counting?  Always poignant and dazzling, the film's writer never strays from his characters in favor of overdramatization. Many opportunities exist and Mr. Kloves always wisely passes.Grady's relationship problems are also piling up. The story takes place over the course of one weekend, and Grady is faced with one dilemma after another involving his married girlfriend, Sara (Frances MacDormand), the school's chancellor, his boarder and student Hannah (Katie Holmes, who will shine once she finds that good, meaty starring role), and of course his estranged wife (played by no one at all).There's a lot to love about Wonder Boys and I assure you I've merely grazed the surface. The real reason I went to see it, though it looked interesting enough from the trailers, was Curtis Hanson. I liked parts of L.A. Confidential enough to see what other tricks he has up his sleeve. I must say that his work here is much more accomplished than Confidential, despite the fact that most critics thought it deserved to beat Titanic a couple of years back. I hope this gives you an idea of just how good I think Wonder Boys is. Unfortunately, this is an early-year, low-budget comedy about scholarly people, and Mr. Hanson will most likely be recognized for the mystery thriller that came before it.I want to be wrong, so don't miss Wonder Boys.Grade: A","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDViMDlhNzgtNjZhZC00YjZmLWJkYzEtOGMwNjNjZDY2OWIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The other young girls in the film are very good too. The film has depth, heart, and is always engaging and compelling. DoucourÃÂ© does a great job of bringing out the humour in some of the film's lighter moments.

Whatever, it's simply a bunch of nice stories about the famous Pooh and his friends.This is refreshing in that there is very, very little violence and no evil characters, no bad guys, both of which are unusual in animated films. The stories are told through a ""book"" which is pictured as the stories unfold. Illustrations are shown in the book and they they come to life to show the particularly story. The voice of Pooh was done by one of the great voices in Hollywood history: Sterling Holloway. All the characters are quite different and there is nice humor here and there for adults and kids. This is as sweet-natured a film as you could ever find. To some it may sound boring, but it's so different in its approach that it is subtly appealing to all ages. I liked and appreciated it much more on the second viewing then acquired the DVD for the third look. This is timeless material and very highly recommended for your kids and for you.

Of course, sex and nudity have long been an ingredient in horror movies, but they are not the ONLY ingredient. It's pretty cynical to paper over a total lack of talent and production values by cramming in as much T and A as possible and then try to sell it to supposedly maladjusted horror fans who, of course, can't get a date with real women so are going to spend Friday nights renting this crap.And after doing their part to bring down the horror genre, these same filmmakers apparently decided (perhaps rightly so)that sci-fi fans were even more pathetic, and thus they came up ""sci-fi erotica"" like ""Femalien"" and ""Emmanuelle in Space"" (which even Jaqueline Lovell and Krista Allen couldn't make suck any less). Then there are the ""erotic thrillers"", but the less said about them the better.

The problem is none of the characters are well rounded or defined beyond the absolute basics (and they do incredibly stupid things throughout the film, especially in the second half). So when things start going bad, it's hard to care. The film seems to want to offer a deep, nuanced look into the world of cults, but West doesn't seem to be able to paint anyone with more than a primary colored brush. Everyone is a caricature ...especially ""Father"", who is little more than a mouthpiece for religious mumbo jumbo. The decision to make this found footage becomes the film's biggest flaw, as the extremely limited use of the camera gives every scene a flat incomplete feeling, totally stripping the film of any gravitas or meaning. Found footage has become a lazy, tired clichÃÂ© in the horror genre and West is no where near talented enough to make it work. West is quickly becoming a hackneyed presence in the world of horror, and it's a mystery why people make such a big deal of him.And I am wondering where the hell the $4 Million budget went, since the cinematography is bare bones, we're only ever in a single location, and there are no explosions or huge actions scenes.

A more appropriate way of saying it might be that it's an interesting movie.  Those poor filmmakers, they're starting to run out of Stephen King novels to make into movies, so they have to turn to his short stories.  Usually this means what should have been a 30 minute movie is drawn out into an hour and a half or longer.  But in the case of Mark Pavia's ""The Night Flier"", story works because Pavia is able to expand on King's original story, and he also seems to have a bit of talent as a director.Most people complain that Miguel Ferrer's character, Richard Dees, is too mean, or something like that.  QUIT COMPLAINING PEOPLE!  He's suppose to be an utterly heartless, sleazy, sorry excuse of a person.  You're not suppose to feel sorry for him at all as he descends to insanity.  Instead having such a terrible lead character is suppose to pose the question whose the real monster?  Or, actually I think it'd be more accurate to say, whose the real hero?  Is there a hero?  Ferrer pulls off the performance perfectly, making a character that could make James Woods or Clint Eastwood whimper in fear.  Unfortunately the rest of the cast doesn't do so well, and this pulls in the movie down a little way.Anyway, Pavia himself has a talent for gloomy atmosphere, with his overcast, gray skies and quiet music and always just slightly-off-angle photography. He expertly subdues the beginning 2/3s of the movie and then throws a bloodbath at us.  It's a very well planned and a shocking move on his part.""The Night Flier"" kicks into major gear towards the end.  The final, final conclusion is a little weak, but it really couldn't have ended any other way.Overall, the couple flaws drag ""The Night Flier"" down to a good but not great movie, but the really cool climax and other elements make up for it, and make it a good time.  Be warned, it won't leave you feeling happy or good.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWM0OTY1YWItYTY2ZC00MzVhLTliM2ItNzJiMzIxMDJhMDI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

However, when I came across it casually on HBO, I was immensely surprised and impressed!The story was gripping and I loved the character development - which is so rare in thrillers today. I thought the cast was brilliant, especially Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgard. Stellan's character was completely chilling, and he played it so effectively. And Diane's character was also wonderfully displayed - despite her terrible actions at times, you can't help but empathize with her a bit, due to Diane's emotional investment in the role. And Trevor Morgan (who I also recently saw in ""A Rumor of Angels"") is sure to do very well on the big screen for years to come... he's very good for such a young kid. And Leelee Sobieski... she was weak at times, but I felt that she was perfect for the part. She has kind of an authentic look to her and she was casted very well for the part. She had on-screen appeal without being too obnoxiously cutsie. She did a fair job, certainly enough to fulfil the director's vision of the movie - I'm sure of that. As far as the story goes, it's got everything you could want in a thriller. There were some holes, but some of my favorite movies of all-time have holes and I think it's really too much to ask for a perfect film. But it's downfall was that at times it was a bit predictable - but for me, that only enhanced the movie's suspense.I greatly enjoyed this movie and I think you will too. I'll agree with the critics that there are some technical flaws in some of the story's details - but over all, the story was very compelling and told VERY well, great development of it's characters and all the events were portrayed very believably, the director definitely kept the audience's trust and attention. So, I recommend it - despite the critic's bashing of the film. Personally, as a teenager, I thought the portrayal of LeeLee's high school was very realistic and so that definitely caught my attention in a good way. Little things like that, that are usually not apparent in most movies today, certainly made up for other little flaws. So, go catch it on HBO or rent it! It's good!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MzA4NzYyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjk3Nzc5._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It is easily the best of the sexual awakening movies that were so popular in the late fifties, early sixties.  And why wouldn't it be - with Kazan at the helm and an original screenplay by William Inge.The film begins with a similar theme to ""Rebel Without a Cause"" - that is why won't parents treat their children like human beings and really help them come to terms with becoming adults?  But halfway through Inge does a clever turn-around and allows the kids to discover that their parents are human beings too, with all the weaknesses and frailties that go with being human. At the same time Inge portrays the coming of age of America as the joy of the roaring twenties moves into the gloom of the Depression. The story is about how prejudice and blind morality destroys a great love - sex shouldn't be such a huge issue between two people who love each other, but the enormous pressures from outside to either do it or refrain from doing it cause confusion, pain and hurt.  Who will ever forget Natalie Wood leaping naked from a bath screaming at her mother that she is not ""spoiled""? Wood gives the performance of her life here, convincingly portraying adolescent love, a nervous breakdown, and the blossoming into woman-hood. Beatty too is splendid as the confused Bud.  And both are so achingly beautiful!The supporting cast is superb down to the smallest role.  Barbara Loden is particularly memorable as Beatty's wild flapper sister, but Pat Hingle as his father, and Audrey Christie and Fred Stewart as Wood's parents are also unforgettable.This is a resonant film that I believe will be more and more appreciated with the passing of time.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIzNGExMzItMGJhNy00YmRjLTgxNDQtMzE5NDYwNDhlMzIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

A.J. Bullard.","296","George Lucas doesn't know anything about aerial warfare!","I'm a former US Air Force F-4 Phantom Weapons Systems Officer (backseater).You know this movie is crap when you start with a supposed fighter squadron commander who doesn't know the difference between a SQUAD (thirteen infantrymen) and a SQUADRON (48 fighter pilots).To paraphrase General George S. Patton, George Lucas doesn't know anything more about real aerial warfare than he does about f --- ing! (And George C. Scott may have said ""fornicating"" in the movie PATTON, but the real Patton used the real F-word!) Lucas was absolutely the worst person in the movie industry to do this movie. This movie is only the latest of many giant steps down the primrose path which Lucas started the world's movie-viewing public with the first STAR WARS movie in 1977; I distinctly remember the documentary on the making of that movie, in which Lucas patted himself on the back for patterning his battle scenes after what he claimed to be the most realistic dogfight scenes ever filmed, and at the same time in the documentary intercutting his scenes with those from A YANK IN THE RAF which were absolutely THE phoniest looking flying scenes ever filmed! And he hasn't bothered to learn jack about aerial warfare in the last 35 years; he's just conned most of the whole world into thinking his cartoonish creations are reality when they're the farthest thing from it. The technical fallacies are far too numerous to list. Lucas doesn't know the first thing about physics or aerodynamics, let alone the complexities of basic fighter maneuvering required to put bullets into another airplane and to prevent another airplane from doing that to one's own. He just makes his CGI airplanes do anything he wants them to do to fit his fantasies and fiction. Lucas is welcome to create his own sci-fi universe where he makes the rules. But for an ""historical"" movie like this claims to be, Chuck Jones could have made cartoon Mustangs imitating the Road Runner and cartoon Messerschmitts imitating Wile E. Coyote and his Acme gadgets, and they wouldn't have been any more technically inaccurate.But that's just about the technical fallacies and impossibilities. One of the biggest issues I have is that this movie was incapable of making the 332nd Fighter Group look good without taking cheap, lying shots at the other US Army Air Force fighter groups who fought in Europe in World War II. And it once again demonstrates George Lucas's total ignorance of aerial warfare in World War II, if not his blatant disregard for the truth. Fighters assigned to escort bombers did not fly in and among the bomber formations, and they certainly didn't stay there when enemy fighters attacked. Escorting fighters flew above and to the sides of the bomber formations, weaving in zigzag patterns to maintain their airspeed while staying even with the much slower bombers. To ""stay with the bombers"" meant disengaging from the enemy fighters and returning to the flanks of the bomber formation AFTER successfully driving off the enemy if not shooting them down within sight of the bomber formations, rather than pursuing the enemy back to their home bases. It was somewhat of an issue in 1943 when the P-51 Mustang had not yet been deployed to the front lines. The older shorter-ranged P-38 Lightning and P-47 Thunderbolt fighters did not have the capability to stay with the bombers all the way to targets deep in Germany, and the bombers suffered horrendous losses to German fighters past the range limits of the P-38s and P-47s. As more 8th Air Force fighter groups replaced their P-47s and P-38s with P-51s, tasks were rotated among the fighter groups between bomber escort and fighter sweep, the latter meaning that the fighters flew out ahead of the bomber route to intercept the German interceptors before they got within sight of the bombers, and/or destroy them on the ground on their own airfields. Total abandonment of the bombers was NEVER condoned. The 8th Air Force was primarily a bomber force, and by the Fall of 1943 the B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator heavy bombers were endangered species. Jimmy Doolittle, the commanding general of the 8th, was no dummy; his doctrine of employing fighters in both bomber escort and fighter sweeps reduced the bomber losses to 20-25% of what they had been before the arrival of the P-51. The Italian-based 15th Air Force quickly followed suit with that doctrine. The promise in RED TAILS fictionally given by Colonel Bullard (actually a thinly disguised version of the real-life Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.) to reduce bomber losses by 70-80% was in real life fulfilled by all American fighter pilots in the European Theater. They not only reduced the bomber losses to a fourth of what they had been, but effectively eliminated the German Luftwaffe over their own home turf wherever they found them, and not just near the bomber formations.RED TAILS insinuates throughout the length of the movie that the 332nd was the only fighter group that stayed with the bombers and that the other fighter groups violated operational orders and standing doctrine by abandoning the bombers in pursuit of German fighters for their own personal glory. The Tuskegee Airmen of the 332nd had a more than honorable combat record and a story to be proud of, a story which could be told without trying to make other US Army Air Force fighter units look bad by telling falsehoods about them. The Tuskegee Airmen deserve better than that.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ5MTg2NzI4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM2NzQzNg@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

She's perpetually afraid, from the opening scenes to closing credits, with little in the way of emotional range, in between. What holds this film together and really defines it is the show stealing performance by Thomas Jane. Janes character, cult leader, Jim Jacobs, is a pretty transparent Jim Jones, Peoples Temple, knock off. But what a knock off! Jane is absurdly good and utterly convincing as Jacobs. So much so, I kept watching what is otherwise a rather mediocre film. Its a shame we don't see more of Jane in leading roles, he clearly has a lot to offer.

Robert Redford plays an unnamed yachtsman deep in a solo voyage in the Indian Ocean when he is hit by catastrophe. Why he is there is not explained but that is not important. What follows is an epic struggle for survival between man and the elements. Fans of Robert Redford will be shocked by his aging good looks and this is accentuated by the sheer physicality of the role, which makes you wonder whether he is too old for the part, but Redford carries it off with aplomb. You'll be blowing hard with him as he lifts, climbs, carries, pushes and pulls his way around the boat. For a man three years shy of his 80th birthday, Redford shows that he is still supremely fit. The director, J.C. Chandor, is fast developing a reputation for lean, mean electrifying storytelling and like his first film, 'Margin Call', another fat free but thrilling examination of the demise of Wall St, 'All is Lost' wastes no time in telling a simple story with skill, verve and edge-of-your-seat tension. What 'Jaws' did for sharks this film will do for yachts. The underwater shots reminds you of the best cinematography of the BBC's finest wildlife documentaries such as 'The Blue Planet' and the camera work of the boat beset by storms are nothing short of miraculous and astonishingly, seemingly free from CGI effects.The fact that Redford does not talk (with one exception which will have you empathising hugely with the character Ã¢ÂÂ 'when it rains, it pours') turns the film into an intense character study and makes his plight even more compelling as you start to care deeply about his fate, so much so that by the end of the film, you are desperately hoping for a contrived ending. Does Redford's character survive? You will have to see the film to find out but what I can tell you is that tears will be rolling down your cheek at the closing credits but why......in sorrow or in relief?With 'Gravity', another man versus the elements (albeit space) film, out in a few weeks time and gaining massive Oscar buzz as one of the best films of the year, 'All is Lost' can also be considered in the same breath as its more illustrious forebear and together with the imminent release of 'Captain Phillips', hearkens back to a time in the 70s when disaster films were all the rage with the triumvirate of 'The Towering Inferno', 'Airport 75' and 'Raid on Entebbe'.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0MzIyMjU1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTk1MjQxMDE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

His obsession with his fictitious loss, leads to his artistic inspiration.It isn't until a young surveyor, (Toyo Fujita) comes across some of Tatsu's artwork, that his genius is discovered.  The surveyor then informs the famous artist, Kano Indara about his discovery, who immediately agrees to meet Tatsu.Indara, his daughter Ume-Ko, and Undobuchida soon realise that they cannot persuade Tetsu to come down from the mountains to further his talent as an artist, without a ploy.Ume-Ko consequently dresses up as a Princess, and the promise of Tatsu being re-united with his long lost love, lures him into Kano Indara's house. Of course, the family realises that Tatsu has a lot of uncivilized and crazy habits which he needs to get rid of, if he is going to fit into civilized Japanese society.Overall, the movie is a very sweet and interesting piece. There is  great use of color-tinting throughout the film, which perfectly reflects the mood and theme.

Viewing this movie recently after a 25-year absence, it was a shock to me to hear the language. I had remembered this strictly as a light-hearted comedy but I can see why it's rated ""R."" That is solely for the language, especially by Pryor, but he was known for his profane humor.If you can put up with that, the film is downright funny, even today. I found myself laughing out loud at a few scenes, all of which I remembered vividly from several viewings in the '70s. They are still just as funny.Who could forget that mammoth criminal with the long, long name - Erland van Lidth de Jeude? He was the guy that scared the hell out of everyone, just by his physical presence. In real life, that man was the opposite of his projected image on screen. He was a graduate of MIT, an accomplished opera singer, an Olympic wrestler, devoted husband and father, writer, etc. The poor man died at the age of 34.It also was interesting to see such a young looking Craig T Nelson and JoBeth Williams.This might have been the best of the Wilder-Pryor films. I was shocked to see that Sidney Poitier directed this movie.

It can be fun to watch them interact.However how many times can you stand watching the main character explain her feelings in baking terms, while baking? I know many great musicals resolve around a central theme. But it's on the nose. Very on the nose. We're supposed to root for the main character and her dream of escaping a difficult situation through bakery, however at some point her relentless baking and recipes with increasingly unhinged names and ingredients just starts becoming gratingly annoying.The music isn't particularly great either. It's fine. Nothing that I'd want to listen to on repeat. The biggest problem is that it all sounds like typical Sara Barailles fare, written for her, but sung by other people. Her typical vocal stylings are frequently imitated by other characters, because that's how the songs were written, but it all becomes very samey.Overall I'd say it's like a pie that's too sweet.

He destroyed Resistance groups, making many who pursued justice after the war look like fools.","25","Masterful Wartime Movie","World War II remains a rich source of inspiration for movies, even seventy years after its end. The clear moral lines between good and evil that the Nazi era puts into relief allow for little wiggle room for postmodern movie makers to blur them. The masterful script and ace directing nevertheless manage to stretch these lines to the uttermost, resulting in a great deal of suspense where the viewer is at times unsure of who is who and who is good or evil.Based on a good deal of historical truth, Riphagen is presented as a combination suspense and mystery. Andries Riphagen, sometimes called the Dutch Al Capone, was an influential member of the Dutch underworld who collaborated with the German occupiers for his own personal gain. Only the most gullible of viewers will be fooled by the smooth stories he tells desperate Jews as he tries to ""help"" them park their assets until after the war. Nevertheless, exactly how Riphagen is scamming people and how particular situations turn out remain unclear until the last moment, as he often has to improvise and adjust his plans based on changing circumstances. This keeps the movie suspenseful till the very last minute. Don't be fooled by what seems to be a slowing down of the story in the last third.Not without minor pacing problems, this movie is nevertheless a major achievement. Despite a ridiculously small budget, it is masterfully executed. The entire movie breathes the 1940s. The acting by Jeroen van Koningsbrugge as Riphagen as well as by the actors in the many indispensable supporting roles are superb. Camera work, lighting and editing haven't succumbed to modern artsy fads but are crisp and effective. Too bad they couldn't get more real German actors to play German soldiers - Richard Gonlag's German (as Willy Lages, head of the regional division of the German secret police SD) in the original Dutch version is very good, but his native Dutch accent is nevertheless unmistakable. Highly recommended.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDUxMGE1OGItZTk2OS00NGE4LTllZjItNDk1NGUwYzgwNDU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA5MDA0Mw@@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It has a great cast and an interesting premise, and I love horror movies so why should this be any different? Well first of all calling it a horror movie is a bit of a stretch. Yeah, there are ""scares"" but they're all the clichÃÂ© flickering lights, someone coming up behind someone else's back, fake out, cheap ass easy jump scares that we've seen a million times and you can see them coming from a mile away. The best thing this movie has going for it is its atmosphere. It all takes place in an empty laboratory and there are some moments where you feel the claustrophobia of being trapped in a place where dead bodies are kept and weird surgical instruments all over the place. But none of that psychological horror is expounded on. It's just like one second I'm like, ""hm, this could actually go somewhere"" and then two seconds later a freaky face pops on screen and it's like ugh, why bother.The acting in this movie is fine for what it is. Aside from the two leads, Evan Peters was the only character I cared about because he was the comic relief but he just isn't given enough to work with. Everything about the movie feels rushed. The characters aren't developed enough. The movie is barely 80 minutes long and it still has dull moments. It also borrows a lot of elements from other horror movies. A good chunk of the movie is straight up ""Event Horizon"" in a laboratory with some ""The Shining"" and ""Lucy"" sprinkled here and there. Sure there is some creepy imagery but it's stuff we've seen a million times. If they had actually built up tension instead of relying on stupid jump scares then maybe the imagery would have some effect. As it stands, it's just like... what a waste.I can't give this movie a lower score because it did have potential and I liked the cast. There are some moments that are admittedly cool, however brief they are. Oh, and none of the movie makes sense. It starts off plausibly with these doctors performing weird experiments but as soon as sh*t starts to go down, any sense of realism goes out the window. The Lazarus Effect isn't terrible - there's just no reason to see it. Go see ""Event Horizon"" or ""The Shining"" if you're in the mood for some real psychological scares.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2ODM1OTA0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxMDI5MzE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It relies on little sex and profanity, but instead has its success rooted firmly in the acting and charisma of young stars Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari.The film centers around Paul Tannek (Jason Biggs), an all-around nice guy from a small town who is now going to college in a big city due to a scholarship he's received.  His personality is a contrast to most people around him, particularly his roommates, who like to party all night and taunt Paul.  Because of his kindness and his apt studying each night, he's considered a loser.Yet, not everything is bad for Paul.  He's met a girl, Dora (Mena Suvari), in his European Literature class, and he develops a fast crush on her. However, he doesn't know that she's secretly having a relationship with the class's teacher, Professor Alcott (Greg Kinnear).  After some mishaps involving a party, Paul begins to develop a strong friendship with Dora and his feelings for her begin to go even farther as he wonders if he even has a chance to have a relationship with her.A warning before watching this film: if you're expecting similar antics from Biggs in American Pie, prepared to be disappointed.  Loser is a contrast to that movie.  It prefers to develop relationships rather than put in some sort of sex joke, and it's all the better for it.  True, there aren't exactly a huge amount of belly laughs in the proceedings, but it's always entertaining, fast, witty, and charming.As I said before, the movie's success lies squarely on the shoulders of Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari, and they're as good as ever.  Biggs nice-guy performance is his best to date and he creates one of the most genuinely likeable and true characters I've seen in movies for a while.  Suvari is equally appealing as the role of a girl whose also kind but is mixed up in the wrong relationship.  The chemistry between them is strong and the best praise I can give this film is the fact that I cared for their characters and wanted to see them get together.The other performances are suitable enough.  The other standout is probably Greg Kinnear as the professor, whose smug performance makes hims a character easy to hate.  There are also appearances from well-known comics like Andy Dick and David Spade, and their brief cameos bring a few good laughs.Amy Heckerling wrote and directed this film, and while her script may be rather predictable, her direction is still good and she shows the same talent she had in the 80's.  This may not be her funniest film, but it's easily the most likeable.Loser also has other little elements that work to its advantage.  The film features a good soundtrack, playing songs that are actually appealing and also work with the scenes and situations it's played along with.  With standout performances, excellent chemistry between the two leads, Loser is a great date movie and one you certainly cannot pass up if you're a fan of both Biggs and Suvari.  This is definitely the most pleasant surprise I've seen in a long time.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWY5ZTEwZDItZWQ0My00NzEwLWI3NzAtNzI1ZTJkMjgyZWMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's not the monsters!"" And you see his point: In order to make horror films truly scary, we must feel afraid for the characters because we truly care for them. We want them to make it out alive. We want them to succeed. This isn't only exclusive to horror films. It applies to every film. If we don't care for the characters, why should we care about the story? What WOLF CREEK 2 and most horror films get wrong is how they couldn't care less for its characters.In WOLF CREEK 2, director Greg Mclean is all for the monster, and this is unfortunate because the monster isn't the hero of the story. He's just a evil figure lurking in the shadows ready to kill anyone that comes his way with some one-liners to shout throughout the film. He has no depth, no layers and neither do the protagonists, which makes it hard to sit through the film feeling anything but anger. All you're left with are set pieces with gore and gratuitous violence thrown on screen, but you don't feel anything because you just don't care.This is what separates good recent horror films like OCULUS and THE CONJURING from WOLF CREEK 2. And it's not to say Mclean isn't capable of making quality horror films. After all, he directed ROGUE, a monster flick that actually focuses on its characters and not the monster itself. It is no surprise to learn, then, that ROGUE is enjoyed more considerably than Mclean's WOLF CREEK films (ROGUE currently stands at a rare 100% on RottenTomatoes). Mclean attempts to flesh out the monster in WOLF CREEK 2, but he spends just 5 minutes to establish that Mick Taylor is a bigot and then continuously pounds the audience in the head about this fact through the rest of the film.As for the protagonists themselves, it doesn't get any better. They are useless, clueless, and uninteresting. I'm sorry, but in this day and age, giving the characters a significant other just doesn't cut it, even when they're heard off screen. More characters appear as the film goes along, but we quickly find out they're there to die a few minutes later, often in gruesome and unpleasant ways. And don't get me started on the female characters. Are we still in the era where all they do is stay on the sidelines and scream helplessly? Aren't we passed that? Or a better question might be SHOULDN'T we be passed that? Regardless, the characters should have been handled better, but it's clear the director was more interested in building a legacy for Mick Taylor to stand beside the likes of Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, and Michael Myers than creating real, sympathetic characters to root for.I despised this film. I despised the senseless violence, the two dimensional characters, and the villain. WOLF CREEK 2 is a perfectly packaged product of what's wrong with modern horror films. It's a string of bloody set pieces barely held together by a script (if that). It's not even fun to sit through in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way. Well, maybe except for the scene involving CGI kangaroos. However, if you're the type of person who wants to cheer for the monster, then so be it. I just wished director Greg Mclean would make more films like ROGUE than continuing to build his WOLF CREEK franchise.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMDMxNjMwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk1MzI1MTE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This seems to be the case with this film, in the story but also the film itself. Though only 1 hour and 7 minutes long it still manages to be testing your patience. The synopsis of the film presented it in a much better light. Maybe I should have stood up and left, but, like the audience in the film, I was hoping for a satisfying finale act.In vain! I didn't find the film more entertaining than the play that gets interrupted by Yannick. I don't see the point in this film, where a weak boulevard play is interrupted by someone who roots for an even inferior play. The film makes fun of Yannick, the actors of the play and also the audience in turn. But to see a fool being foolish and being laughed at till he turns the table on the others who now begin to look foolish, including the audience, is no great art either and not really better than the play it mocks.Of course, you could argue that the story should be looked at as a political statement: a fool, critizising other fools in view of a foolish audience, but honestly, others have done that much better.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVmMzc0MTctMTYxOC00MTgxLWJmOGUtNDljYmIxM2E4NTdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY4MzYzNTg4._V1_UY209_CR7,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"
"In the Loop","1973.0","","106.0","Comedy","7.4","83.0","Armando Iannucci","Tom Hollander, Peter Capaldi, James Gandolfini, Harry Hadden-Paton","61,646","A political satire about a group of skeptical American and British operatives attempting to prevent a war between two countries.","143","Get In the Loop","Is it a work of fictional farce or an insightful view of the members of the governmental bureaucracy? Probably in truth, In The Loop is a little bit of both, but more so its a whole lot of fun at the governments expense. There have been numerous films over the years giving us insight into how our government works, at times it sure looks bleak and unjust, but we sure haven't seen it in such a ridiculous view. In The Loop aims at making sure they scrutinize the bureaucratic desk jocks for all their worth. The film follows the Minister of International Development (Tom Hollander) after he has put his foot in his mouth, unintentionally announcing that war is unforeseeable. Back tracking and word-smith manipulations prove mute, fortunately for the Minister he's got big fans in the US who would like nothing more then to use the naive Brit in their political posturing. The hawks begin circling and before the Minister knows what game he's playing he's into deep and merely a puppet in the political theater.There is a hint of a serious political thriller in the plot here, but In The Loop knows we've seen all that before so why not have a little fun, actually why not have a whole lot of fun and throw in lots of scalding four letter words and absolute British wit. Tom Hollander as the Minister of I.D. is dumb-foundingly perfect in his role and is well complemented by his bungling assistant Oliver (played exceptionally by Chris Addison). As the Director of Communications, Peter Capaldi steals the show with his relentlessly scathing superhuman vulgarity ridden wit. Those with a distaste for such colorful language should look elsewhere as their ears will certainly be on fire if they can last through a third of the film. Personally the language was not a problem for me, I appreciate a master of the finer words, and Capaldi has shown himself to deliver his lines with such craftsmanship that sailors around the world will be put to shame.The Brits are a fantastic mess, but of course what international mess would be complete without the United States Govt.. And so comes the behemoth know as James Gandolifini, the Don Capo hasn't lost any of his on-screen presence. As the ol' war vet Pentagon General, Gandolfini is gruff and verbally abusive in a really mean spirited way, which is glorious. Those with a keen sense of cinema will notice how well the film shifts humor as the Brits come across the pond to the the dry humor of America. Gandolfini makes the most of his screen time, but on the American side the majority of the ridiculousness comes from Mimi Kennedy, as the Assistant Secretary of Diplomacy and her bickering 20 something Capital Hill brown nosing assistants. Director Armando Ianucci's delivers such a cynical sharp witted look at all things politically ridiculous and it works on so many levels. Fans of British humor will love this, its pureness to the form is perfectly meshed into the political platform that moves the comedy along with merely a few small bumps in the road. On the other side of the coin, those who enjoy making fun of those of the diplomatic persuasion will delight in the roasting of our governmental members.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NzQxNzA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQ0NDk0Mg@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Never could I have predicted the deep, meticulously crafted scenes, led so strongly by Abbie Cornish playing Fanny. The heartwrenching emotion in this movie was unlike any other; there has never been a more real portrayal of the most simplistic yet most common emotions that rule the heart. Campion went far beyond the usual ""I am deeply in love; Now I am sad"" and truly captured human idiosyncrasy as she delved into the illogical, irrational minds of two young and suddenly in love individuals. At times, it was almost too much to bear due to how intensely palpable the sadness was. To some, certain scenes or moments may have seemed a little longer than usual, but completely necessary is the silence, just as much as the dialogue. This film perfectly embodied how a simple, real, profound story should be told.If the above were not enough to drive this movie on, the aesthetics were nothing short of spectacular. Each stitch in Fanny's sewing was as beautiful as each scene in a field of lavender or room flooded with butterflies. The magnificent settings, costumes, and natural sunshine pouring into a perfectly decorated room felt not contrived, but simply like a very real dream. As the curtains in Fanny's room got caught in the breeze, it was as if you felt it cooling you down ever so slightly as her content emotion overtook your mind.Ben Whishaw, too, was superb: perfectly embodying the fragile, wondrous poet that was John Keats, so full of tender emotion. Fanny's younger sister was another beautiful element of this film and really stole the show in her own right with her hilarious and endearing perception of life in general. Each character and each line spoken brought something so special to the story. As much witty humor as there was aching sorrow, this movie is not one to be missed.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NjEwNDgxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkyOTM3Mg@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

More now than a few years back. It's raw, it's simple, it feels real, it even sounds real because of the simple fact that there's barely any soundtrack at all.If you're someone that judges movies based on the hundreds of millions of dollars in special effects, then this is definitely not a movie for you. This is a movie for those that want to feel the past. That same past that brought us to this point.The performances were solid and the movie didn't rely on any single character. Mainly because it was aiming to feel and look real, and not some fantasy where some Mary Sue or Gary Stu can just take on everyone singlehandedly. Even the lack of soundtrack serves to put you in that mindset. The silence that accompanies the movie in the slowest scenes, is really to show viewers how were those times. How slow placed life could be when the shores were done, and there was nothing else to do.The film does pick up the pace after some time, and after that it's a race to the finish line. But that race is correctly paced so the viewer is not overwhelmed, or loses important details.It's a very good movie, that is showing the viewer a different time that our ancestors went through. And although it could've taken advantage of the obvious north and south division, to land some political message like Hollywood movies try to do in every single movie, it avoided that mistake making it clear that the events were about those people in that land, in that time.It just isn't an excellent movie, because unfortunately sometimes the slow pace does numb you out a little bit. But considering it isn't a Hollywood movie with hundreds of millions of dollars in budget, it manages to deliver a more interesting overall result than many more recent movies.I'm actually very satisfied to have seen this movie, and I'll definitely recommend it as a must watch to all those that want to have a taste of the past.Another aspect that might drive some people away, is the very real raw brutality of it all. Remember that these were the frontier times, when the law was mostly decided by the gun, and what you had was many times things others would take without any hesitation or problems of conscience. So if you're expecting this movie to soften up what was the brutal reality of those times, you're going to find out just how good you have in these current times.And there lies a lesson I think. Because nowadays too many people have grown so accustomed to fighting for nothing, they have to make up things to fight about. But in those times you didn't had to come up with things to fight about... Life was a daily fight. And people had no time to waste on pointless endeavors.This movie will definitely go to my collection. And is one of the rare cinematic gems of 2022.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRhMmI4NmMtYTk1MC00ZWMzLWJjYzMtZGQ4YzAxZWRjYmQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzUzMDQxMzI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Owing to the fact that it took original ""Guns"" producer Carl Foreman a decade to get the ""Force 10"" film project off the ground, Gregory Peck and David Niven were both  Social Security eligible by the time the film was ready to go, and that meant we'd have to see a new cast.  And for the most part, despite the borrowing of footage of the first film's climax at the beginning you might as well watch this film pretending the first one never happened.   The ""Nicolai"" connection to the first film is weak and barely explored, and we probably could have done without that plotline altogether.  And whereas ""Guns"" was deadly serious in tone, filled with some rich character studies and literate exploration of the moral questions that get raised even when fighting a good cause, ""Force 10"" is really more of an escapist war film, punctuated with moments of light comedy, and with no depth whatsoever in the characters and script.  If one is willing to accept the film on that level, then it can be enjoyed as an entertaining diversion, but no more.   It is interesting to see Harrison Ford in his first post-Star Wars role working alongside the great Robert Shaw in his last film, and Edward Fox appears to emulate most of David Niven's mannerisms quite well.   Carl Weathers though, was an annoying distraction and the scene where he demanded ""answers"" while the enemy was approaching was just plain dumb.   By it's very title though, ""Force 10"" is always going to have the problem of it's magnificent predecessor hanging over it.  Too bad the sequel possibility wasn't cashed in on sooner when Peck, Niven and Quinn could have still done their parts (I always hoped they'd lead a new mission to rescue Anthony Quayle!)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2NkZDI4MTQtOWQxOS00YWUzLTg4ZmItMTQxNTgyN2VmNWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

""Book of Shadows"" certainly didn't follow the same suspense strategy but it did present some original ideas as to how the sequel should be made.  The movie is certainly less suspenseful but offers a little more gore and shock value coppled with a lot of really good heavy metal music.  I liked the movie and it actually reminded me more of the ""Tales from the Crypt"" shows than the ""The Blair Witch Project"".  The characters are fun to watch and Kim Director plays a very interesting goth chic...which I liked.

I went in without any preconceptions other than the movie looked very zany after seeing the trailer on YouTube.What surprised me most other than the very energized racing sequences, is that there seemed to be a whole back story to the universe where the races were taking place. There were hints of politics, history and other tidbits that made each of the locations that are visited and the characters shown have a lot more substance than just a pretty backdrop. You can almost imagine a whole prequel movie leading up to the events in this movie.Of course this is anime so they did have a few of the clichÃÂ© characters such as dashing yet arrogantly confident pretty boy and the ""I have to be independent and strong"" female character that gets his attention.

Plus the characters are a fun mix of races and designs.The movie isn't about the subtleties of racing such as taking corners well or the art of overtaking by any means, its very much a ""I'm much more driven and angrier than you, so now I'll catch up and overtake!"", but with the world this is taking place in, the different array of vehicles all going up against each other and the obstacles that keep popping up, its just fun.There is a scene where there are some boobs hanging out, but the story never gets sexual, so if you don't mind your kids seeing a little bit of breast you should be fine. The violence is a hard one, there is some serious fighting and some of the concepts as to how a person died may be a little scary to the younger kids, but a lot of this happens very fast.Do see this movie if you want something visually engrossing, good for when friends are over. Just remember, have it loud and on a big screen!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDQ4MzU1NjUtOGE5Mi00MTIyLTk2NjItMGIyM2RiZDNmMDU0L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

All of the while there's this killer on the loose and when he lets it be known he thinks the killer is a cop - suddenly he's reassigned to River Patrol.This movie succeeds on a basic level -- it's entertaining. Sure the story is loose and the film's surprises are somewhat stale, but it's all in good fun. Willis gets to look aptly serious and hunt for the killer on the waters and there's just enough suspense to sustain interest and the story moves at a good pace. Meanwhile the rounded supporting cast keeps things lively and keeps the viewer going, ""Where have I seen him before?"" or ""Hey that's such and such"".I've read on here how people think this is stupid, dumb and lacks any suspense or thrills.

In reality Coach Russell arrived at the Masonic Home in 1926. He built the program into a quality outfit that reached the state championship game against Corsicana in 1932. That game ended in a scoreless draw with the state title awarded to Corsicana in the tie breaking system of penetrations inside the opponents 20 yard line. My guess is producers opted to take liberties with the timeline in order to insert President Franklin Delano Roosevelt into the story.

It was a very simple movie, but made with such a good ironic humor and very good, holding action. The action takes place in Norway, were an American family inherits a house from their Norwegian side of family, and will basically start a new life. But then they discover the barn elfs, and when they broke the rules, the elfs became angry, and came for revenge! It's something you can see on the trailer, it's predictable what is going to happen, but on the same time, not. It was many unpredictable scenes that were made so funny that I started to laugh. The humor. Very good, but not for everyone. In the movie they laugh and make fun out of Norwegians in a way that maybe not everyone will understand. But if you understand everything, then I guarantee it is a fun experience. For example, if someone knows, Norwegian Police isn't the strongest and most menacing police ever. But of course, in here, they dragged it and made it extra funny, including a totally non-caring Sherif in the town, that prefers to watch Love Actually then investigate in the action. They did also use some ironic and unserious dialogues that were totally out of place, but I liked it. I liked that they didn't took the movie too serious, and made it more to a low-budget black comedy! When the fighting with the elfs came, it was also made great, with some awesome camera angles and creative attacks. The elfs themselves was more of the cheap sort, the costumes looked really cheap, but this isn't supposed to be a high-budget movie either. Sometimes the elfs were too exaggerated, and it was just too much, so I think the movie could been fifth teen minutes shorter. Not a big deal, but something that could be possibly changed. Besides that, this is an awesome experience, nice elf fun, it is a little bloody, and I can safely say that it is very entertaining!

Regression was in some ways an 8, or dare I say it 9, but some of its flaws are just too bad g to ignore. I will start by talking about its strong points. The story line and script were engaging, unpredictable and fresh. There were enough twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing, and without too much in fact happening, the film is disturbing and uncomfortable to watch. The twists as the film goes on are not outlandish - a careful viewer will be able to pick up on a number of subtle clues. The acting is good and the characters succeed of convincing us of their roles - mostly. What then is wrong? First and foremost - whilst the female lead is a good actress, her American accent just isn't convincing enough for us to forget about Hermione. Secondly, whilst I am no expert of the American justice system, some of the practises and actions taken by the police seem questionable and unrealistic. The psychologist is clichÃÂ© and annoying - going round insulting strangers for having religious beliefs. The ending is an anti climax once the big revelation has occurred, and it seems like the writers tried to re kindle the atmosphere, which doesn't happen. The ending is also a bit hard to square in your mind logically. Therefore, whilst this film is a very enjoyable watch, its flaws deprive it of the 8+ score in my eyes.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk4NWI4ZDAtZDNmYy00Mjk3LTg2NDMtNDkxMmZiMDM1OTQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyNDQ2NjI@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The Family that Preys is seriously one of the better films I've seen so far in September, it's an honest drama that keeps your attention, it was also very touching. In some ways this was the female version of The Bucket List, even as it was hard to watch, it was still an incredibly moving movie. The chemistry between Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard was just dead on and you really believed in their friendship. I also loved the side story between the two sisters and their husbands, one sister who is rich and spoiled with a good husband who is in major denial about what his wife really is, the other sister who wishes for her husband to keep his head up and live his dream. Tyler Perry pulls in a good family story that will have you smiling at the end.Alice and Charlotte are best friends, Charlotte is a rich business woman who's son wants to take over her company, she's rooting for a different C.O.O. that she hand picks, Abby, who is a strong woman who is working her way to the top. Alice is a struggling woman who Charlotte asks if they can go on a road trip together, she agrees, they go across country enjoying the last bits of life. But what they don't realize is that at home Alice's daughter, Andrea, is sleeping her way to the top behind her loving husband's back, her other daughter is begging for her husband to live his dreams, and Charlotte's son is just a sleaze who will step on anyone to get to the top.The Family that Preys is seriously a very good movie, it will not disappoint you. I'm really disappointed in a lot of these ratings. I believe there are some users lately who don't even see the movie, they just rate it a low number just because they don't like who's the star or whoever is making the film, please, you have to trust me on this film, it's a little treasure and a very strong film that will remind you to not take life for granted, stay strong, and remain proud of who you are. The script had extremely well written lines and I loved the representation of the hardship of being a woman trying to compete in a man's working world, not to sound horrible, but I imagine that's even harder for an African American woman and this movie just inspires you that it is possible to stay strong and work hard, keep the faith, and good things will come to you. This is a fantastic movie, I highly recommend it.8/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyNTQ4ODc0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTk4ODk3MQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He also directed arguably the best of the FRIDAY THE 13th sequels - The Final Chapter. He shows us his love for the hack and slash cycle here, by renewing a few scenes from two of the genre's pioneers. You've got the 'murder in the shower' fresh out of Hitchcock's renowned classic PSYCHO. Here Zito makes it a lot more brutal, with some realistic and visually stunning gore effects from horror maestro Tom Savini. And then there are various references to Carpenter's HALLOWEEN, including the assassin digging up the grave of the victim he killed some 35 years earlier. Michael Myers steals his sister Judith's headstone from her grave when he escapes from his 15 year spell in Haddonfield's asylum. But although there are brief nods to his obvious influences, Zito also manages to supply some originality and some genuinely scary sequences. Back in the day it was thought that he was going to be the next Tobe Hooper after his flawless work within the horror genre. But sadly he went on to work with more action-orientated films such as Missing in Action, Red Scorpion and Invasion USA.The plot is believable and also extremely well written. It opens with black and white footage of GIs returning victoriously from WW2. Cut to a letter from a girl named Rosemary to an unseen receiver, stating how she 'does not want to hurt him, but could wait for him no longer...' In other words someone's been dumped and it looks as if a few people are going to have to suffer because of it! Again cut to Avalon Bay Graduation dance 1945 and we're shown the lady Rosemary for the first time with her new 'fella'. While the host merrily talks about Glenn Miller's death, Rose and her cocky boyfriend head out under the stars for a spot of good old harmless (or extremely harmful in these films!) huggin' and a kissin'! They choose a spot at the end of a brightly laminated pier and continue to smooch the night away under the stars, unaware that a somewhat unfriendly looking guy disguised in GI garb and brandishing a bowie knife is watching their every move! Suddenly the lights go out, and Rose and her partner are brought a little bit closer together...Both impaled on a pitchfork!Skip 35 years and Avalon Bay is preparing for the first graduation dance since the fateful events that occurred before. While the young enthusiastic teens are shown getting ready to find romance at the dance, it looks as if a certain unknown someone is preparing for another bloody massacre. One girl unknowingly predicts the events that follow while she's getting dressed for the party by saying to her sulky looking friend ""Hey you're not gonna mope about tonight are ya? Some of us will never see each other again..."" Her remarks prove to be surprisingly accurate!THE PROWLER is often pipped in the popularity stakes by the same year's similar slasher MY BLOODY VALENTINE. Many reviewers also find the latter to be the slightly better of the two. However I beg to differ, because even though MBV is a decent enough movie, I find this to be a scarier and for the most part more sinister attempt with a much stronger cast. Zito's spooky direction is superb and Savini's 'almost too realistic' gore touches just round it off perfectly. There are a few jumps to increase your heartbeat and I strongly wouldn't recommend any young femme fatale who's trying to grow her finger nails to watch this flick alone, because there are a couple of scenes when I guarantee you'll be biting them off!! One of my favorite ever murder scenes is also in this flick, the excellent swimming pool killing. A female teen who is bathing by herself under the moonlight paddles over to the ladder to climb out of the pool. She reaches the steps and begins to ascend them when all of a sudden she is brutally kicked in the face. She finally comes back to her senses and looks around to see who attacked her, but no one is anywhere to be seen! The silence is broken when the killer jumps out of the water behind her and gorily slices her throat in amazing detail. Watch for the blood that leaks out of her wound as her lifeless body sinks in to the murky depths of the cold water; it's Savini at his best...Excellent! The cast are also superb, which, must've helped the general production no end. Veteran actors Farley Granger and Lawrence Tierney have small roles, but the real 'round of applause' goes to fresh faced newcomers Goutman and Dawson who actually steal the show. It's only a shame they never went on to do much worth noting in the movies after this.All in all THE PROWLER is everything a slasher should be dark, scary, gory while at the same time fun. It's incredibly underrated so I would most definitely recommend it, try and hunt down a copy if you can and I guarantee you will not be disappointed!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjRmYjcyYjctYWZiMy00ZjQ5LWI4YzItNTUwZGE5MmM5NWU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDgxODg1MzU@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Now I know many people have a disdain for Michael Bay, but I actually think that he brings some visual prowess to his projects however it's clear that his name was only attached for recognition purposes. This is neither anything visually bombastic or anything close to being a pulse pounding thriller. It's a very amateur romantic drama that focuses more on the interpersonal communication between characters as they struggle through the changing times. It becomes increasingly dragging and you just keep asking yourself what the real intent of the overall film really is. Some of the actors are seasoned veterans but are truly underutilized for new or younger actors that are frankly not on par.

The current 3.9 rating at IMDb is, to my mind, ludicrous and flat-out wrong. It may not be an incredible, immortal masterpiece - I do have to admit it is second to The Abyss - but this is definitely a good movie in virtually every way. For the last fifteen years I've owned a VHS tape of it recorded from a laser-disc version, and seen it loads of times. Today I got the Region 2 Widescreen DVD, and I was once again confirmed in my opinion that this is a fine movie. It is underwater sci-fi horror, and one of several such movies from the era, but except that it doesn't have the clout, effects wizardry and budget of a James Cameron attached to it, it manages to be an extremely well-crafted production none the less.The actors are great. Every one of them have absolutely unique and realistic character traits and the dynamism between the crew is superbly entertaining. Nancy Everhard as a soft-spoken female navy seal is played with humble sincerity and feminine sensitivity, making for a very realistic package. Nia Peeples is the sexiest thing you ever saw, and the one whose intuition foresees the whole thing. Miguel Ferrer is even more obnoxious here than in Twin Peaks, yet also profoundly pitiable. Everybody gives an amazingly human and believable performance, and the action and production values are overall perfectly adequate and effective, succeeding entirely in suspending the viewer's disbelief.To the day I die, I will maintain that this is a good movie. And posterity will prove me right. One day...9 out of 10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmMTBjNDAtMWUxNi00NDM5LTlhMDItOWNhNzliMmUxNGZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It doesn't matter whether you're pushing pixels or pencils: if the story isn't there, all the synergistic cross-platform push in the world won't overcome archaic, low-tech, person-to-person word of mouth. In the case of ""Barnyard,"" Paramount and Nickelodeon don't even have much of a ""product,"" much less a movie. It didn't appeal to the little ones in our party, and left several of the adults in various stages of slack-jawed stupefaction.The much-discussed cross-gender, udder-enhanced bulls only hint at the parade of dubious marvels to be found within this marketing opportunity. (Again, ""Barnyard"" may be many things to many stockholders...but it's *not* a movie.) Its demerits have been detailed by so many critics, reviewers and movie sites that they hardly need to be repeated here.We saw ""Barnyard"" at a drive-in theater, so if there was something in the film's multichannel audio mix that would somehow enhance its qualities beyond belief, we missed it. However, the coup de grace to ""Barnyard"" was unwittingly delivered by the exhibitor, who ran an old Tex Avery cartoon (""Doggone Tired"") prior to the show. There was more comedy, better artwork (the design and poses of the dog alone drew laughs) and more emotional honesty in this six or seven minute cartoon than in all of ""Barnyard."" My 6-year old niece and her 4-year old brother kept recounting the best moments of this ""ancient"" short all the way home. When I interrupted to ask my niece what she thought of ""Barnyard,"" she paused a moment and said, ""Well...I'm sorry, but...I didn't think it was really too good"" - then proceeded to chatter on about the Avery cartoon.When children find that a nearly 60-year old cartoon short (in a faded, deteriorating print to boot) is more entertaining and memorable than the 2-hour animated feature it precedes, it can only mean one thing: Time for the suits at Nickelodeon to call more meetings, do more ""market research,"" and tell the ""creatives"" to come up with storyboards for ""Barnyard II: The Original Party Animals Meet The Fairly Odd Parents!""

I hadn't heard about the movie prior to getting the chance to sit down here in 2023 to watch it. And with it being a horror movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I opted to watch it.I had no expectations to the movie, as I knew nothing about it, aside from whatever little was mentioned in the synopsis, so writers Michelle Garza Cervera and Abia Castillo had every chance to entertain, impress and bedazzle me with the script and storyline for the movie.However, ""Huesera"" turned out to be a slow burn of a horror movie, and with heavy emphasis on slow. Man, talk about a slow and boring narrative. Nothing, and I mean that literally, happened of any worth throughout the snail paced narrative. I managed to endure a staggering hour of torment of the 97 minutes that the movie ran for. Then I just gave up out of sheer and utter boredom. There was nothing interesting taking place on the screen, and the narrative was so slow that it was an ever growing struggle to keep faking an interest in the storyline.It should be noted, however, that the acting performances in ""Huesera"" were actually good. Just a real shame that the actresses and actors literally had nothing worthwhile to work with in terms of a properly interesting and entertaining script.Visually then ""Huesera"" was nothing noteworthy. There was nothing particularly spectacular to see on the screen. And as for director Michelle Garza Cervara's ""Huesera"" movie being a horror movie, yeah well, that might be stretching the term quite a bit. Unless, of course, an insanely slow paced narrative counts as horror.""Huesera"" is not a movie that I will recommend for horror fans to venture out and get to watch. It just simply isn't worth the effort.My rating of ""Huesera"" lands on very, very generous three out of ten stars, as the movie's production value does seem good.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxOWYxODItZmJhYi00NjllLWIzMWItMWZiYTQ3Mzc2MjY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM2MzgyOTU@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He takes the part of the pursued and kills one of the attackers. The man he has helped turns out to be Rex Willard (William Ching) the son in law of Tuck Ordway (Robert Barrat) a powerful rancher with whom Madden has some issues. It also seems that Madden had been romantically involved with Ordway's daughter Lorraine (Dorothy Malone) who is now married to Willard.Riding into town Madden meets an old nemesis Seabo Pearlo (John Baragrey) the owner of a local saloon, and his ""singer"" Reva (Peggie Castle). Lawyer Luddington (John Dehner) is also there and we learn that Madden has hired him to find out if Ordway truly owns his ranch, Warbonnet. It turns out that he doesn't and the property falls into the public domain.Meanwhile Pearlo frames Willard for the murder of the gunman and Lorraine comes to Madden for help. He reluctantly agrees to attend the inquest but is ambushed by Pearlo's gunman, The Peso Kid (Paul Richards). Reva nurses him back to health and he returns to town in search of the Kid. However he learns that the Kid is planning to kill Willard on his way to trial with Deputy Barclay (Mickey Simpson). Madden is unable to prevent the murder and returns to town to learn that Pearlo has designs on Ordway's ranch.Not being interested in the ranch Madden decides that it's time to confront Ordway. The two agree to meet in a showdown in a darkened room where Madden learns that Ordway is almost blind. Madden returns to town to confront the Kid. Then there's the land rush for Ordway's property. Madden decides to join in and................................The romance between the Scott and Malone characters is a little hard to be taken seriously as he was twice her age at the time.

Personally, I always watch heist movies and feel bad for the victims, regardless of how truly endangered they are. If your leading man or lady has good intentions, then it becomes easier to watch, but I've never quite had an experience like The Old Man and the Gun before. This is a film that takes its time telling the story at hand and there's hardly ever an exciting moment, but it never feels like it drags. This is (surprisingly) a true story that I believe everyone will get a kick out of and here's why.Following Forrest Tucker (Robert Redford) after he has escaped from prison, The Old Man and the Gun is really just about a man who doesn't have many years left in his life and simply wishes to do what makes him happy. Robbing banks in the most polite way that he possibly can, without ever harming anyone, and pretty much always getting away with it, the character of Forrest is absolutely perfect for the way this film portrays him. Whether he's in a high-speed chase to the sound of a calm country song or sitting in a diner with a woman whom he's trying to form a connection with, this is truly one of the most relaxing experiences I think I've ever had at the movies in quite some time.Robert Redford has always been a likable screen presence. Since his early days in movies like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to even small roles in films like Pete's Dragon today, he has always had the charisma to charm his audience. This may very well be his final performance and if that's really the case, I believe he has gone out on a very high note. I don't believe this film isn't going to win any awards or really be nominated for all that much, but in terms of purely enjoying a character on-screen, The Old Man and the Gun delivers on everything you'd expect, and then some.Yes, as I said, this is a very calm film, so what's a calm experience without the much-needed elements. For a movie like this, you'd expect a slow score and music that will put you at ease, along with some solid comedy in the moments where he may be going a little too far for his particular characteristics. The film provides all of that and more. There were moments where I felt he was about to go out of character, but then the film either came up with a joke to make you feel comfortable about his choices or played a country song that was so on the nose that it makes you laugh. For as slow as this film is, it never once had me checking my watch. This 90-minute film flies by, even with its slow pace.In the end, The Old Man and the Gun is the type of film that's very hard to find a complaint about. It has a specific direction and it sticks with it throughout its entire duration. It's about a wanted gentleman who goes under the radar and robs banks, finds love and is continuously hunted by the police (namely a cop played by Casey Affleck, who is also extremely enjoyable in the movie). Look, if you're looking for a complex cops and robbers story, then I would look elsewhere, but if you just want to relax at the movies and have a good time, this is the perfect film for exactly that. The Old Man and the Gun comes highly recommended from me.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk3NjU5MjIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjU0OTU2NTM@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The world that Haynes creates is so meticulously detailed that one almost forgets that the movie isn't fifty years old.Julianne Moore deserves an Academy Award for her portrayal of Cathy Whitaker, a homemaker whose idyllic life begins to disintegrate when she learns that her husband is gay. Moore's Cathy is a delicate woman who would like to be courageous, but can't be because of the world that she is trapped in. As her innocence begins to die, she realizes how empty and superficial her life is. When she begins a cautious romance with her black gardener (Dennis Haysbert) she begins to see the racism and hypocrisy that forms the underbelly of a seemingly perfect world. At the end of the film Cathy has no illusions, and realizes that the life that she thought was perfect is actually a never-ending hell.Dennis Quaid is equally stunning as Cathy's tortured husband Frank. After Cathy discovers his homosexuality, the two are forced to grapple with a truth that neither of them can comprehend. Frank goes to a doctor for ""treatment,"" and his confession is heartbreaking. He says that he ""can't let this thing, this sickness, destroy my life. I'm going to beat this thing."" We look at Frank and pity him because we realize that such a feat is impossible, and unnecessary, but Frank does not possess that knowledge. Frank begins to drink more, and when he finally breaks down and tells Cathy that he has fallen in love with another man, all of the anger, shame, and joy comes pouring out of him all at once. It is a supremely moving moment, and the best performance of Quaid has ever given.As the marriage between Cathy and Frank begins to unravel, the two also begin to fight. All of Cathy and Frank's arguments and confessions take place at night, bathed in shadows. The truth has no place in this bright, artificial world, and it must stay hidden at all costs. One night, when Frank tries to make love to Cathy and can't, Cathy tries to placate him, saying that he is ""all man"" to her. At that remark Frank hits her, and for a moment the audience does not breathe. Cathy then asks quietly for her husband to get her some ice. Cathy is all restraints, and it is only with her kind gardener that she has a chance to break free. The scenes between Moore and Haysbert crackle with erotic energy because everything remains unsaid. When Cathy finally asks him to dance with her, it is a moment when we realize what human beings are capable of being together. The fourth example of stellar acting comes from Patricia Clarkson as Cathy's best friend Eleanor. Eleanor is a bitter, gossipy, cold-hearted woman, and when she tells Cathy ""I am your best friend,"" you want to scream to Cathy not to believe her. Clarkson makes the most of her rather limited screen time, and turns in a fascinatingly layered performance.Far From Heaven may very well be the best picture of the year. In creating an artificial world, Todd Haynes has managed to lay bare the human soul in a way that has never been done before. It is a moving and important motion picture, populated with some of the most nuanced acting I have ever seen. Cathy and Frank Whitiker may be far from heaven, but the film comes about as close to heaven as is possible.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE5ODI3MTM4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjE5OTg2._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Actual men and women worked on this film with no intention of creating a hysterically abominable failure.  Yet, despite a premise that fails to produce anything beyond derisive laughter, the project somehow landed financing.Highlights include: The Khan of Parmistan, a man who looks like Albert Einstein with Carl Levin's comb-over.  ""The Town of the Crazies,"" a village of criminally insane people.  A man who severs his own hand for no apparent reason in the aforementioned town.  A man (also in that town) who wears a cloak with the back cut out to reveal his buttocks.  The oft-repeated location, ""Karabal, on the Caspian Sea.""  The title card that lets us know when we've arrived at ""Karabal, on the Caspian Sea.""  Princess Rubali and her odd fascination with cutlery.  A man named ""Thorg,"" who has been admired by the hero ""since Munich.""  An actual line of dialogue that refers to ""a nightmare in hell.""  The five punch/kick sound effects that get recycled beyond believability.  A character who presumably fell to his death in a gaping, barren canyon only to have his fall ""broken by some trees.""  The random placement of gymnastics apparatuses.  The complete lack of resolution to numerous dangling plot points.  Kurt Thomas's wardrobe and haircut. The men working at ""The Salt Mines,"" who just poke a large pile of refined salt with hoes.  Also, we get the privilege of seeing a shadowy government agent push away a gymnastics groupie who tries to get too close to a post-dismount Kurt Thomas.If you happen across this movie, you must watch it.  ""Gymkata"" stands as an example of what happens when no one offers a dissenting opinion anywhere in the filmmaking process.  This is a technique that was later revealed in Joel Schumacher's ""Batman & Robin.""""Gymkata"" fulfills every expectation you may have of a film combining gymnastics and ninjitsu.  Plenty of gymnastics, plenty of ninjitsu.  See it with a friend and enjoy its many failures.

The only reason I was mildly interested in it is because I noticed Hanno Koffler, whom I had seen in an earlier homosexual film I really enjoyed, Summer Storm. It is a film that sucks you in from the beginning, at first being all jumbled up and out of place leaving room to wonder, and then has a very steady progression.The characters are genuine and believable. (I don't know what it is but foreign gay films are always much better than American ones.) There are very heartbreaking and heartwarming scenes, as well as just uncomfortable ones; it is a roller coaster of emotions. Another thing is there was also some intense and erotic scenes; the two leads have excellent chemistry together. Some cookie-cutter gay problems ensue, but overall the films stands it's own in knowing that it needs to be more than ""just a gay film"". I was really impressed with the subtle and wonderful deliverance of Kay Engel by Max Riemelt. He's a very beautiful man and some of his scenes are worth seeing just for the sheer acting value.Very pleasing, a movie that has definitely stuck with me for all it gives.

There have even been two sequels. The third one was called The Eye 10 as a marketing ploy by the US director. It is truly awful, so avoid it like the plague.That being said, the thing that both US influenced versions have are a total lack of creativity, suspense, or originality. It is a pity that Ms. Alba chose this role, as it was merely a shell of the original film. Every scene was reproduced in a typical US-dumbed down format, with typical cheap Friday the 13th scares thrown in. This version ironically lost sight of the original vision of the Pang Brother's classic. Instead, they change key plot elements to ""add to"" the suspense, IE: American audiences can't think, so we have to hold up a sign that says ""SCREAM"".Do yourself and others a favor and rent, or even better buy a copy of the original.

Deserves more attention","~I want to start off by saying that V/H/S 2 is a huge step up from its predecessor. It delivers more chills, thrills, action, and what we enjoy most...FUN! I was completely thrown off when I first watched this movie. I didn't know it was going to be so insane. ~For the people who haven't seen the first V/H/S, basically the movies are about a bunch of 'found-footage' short horror stories played through VHS tapes by people in a house. While they are watching these VHS tapes, something spooky is also going on in the house as well that stretches through the whole movie giving you updates on what's happening in the between changing of tapes. Now let's get to the tapes which is the main focus of this film. I won't give super spoilers, but i'll just give brief description of each tape.TAPE 1 - ""Phase 1 Clinical Trials"" This ghost story tape is the only one that made me jump a bunch of times. It will be the jump scare tape and that's what it heavily focuses on in scaring you. I enjoyed it for it's jump scares, but there is a questionable scene in there that doesn't make any sense, but luckily, I, a horror movie fanatic, knows that you aren't suppose to take horror movies that seriously or think SUPER deep about it. This one gets a... 8/10 (generous)TAPE 2 - ""A Ride in the Park"" Ever wanted to see through the eyes of a zombie? Well this is your lucky short. This is a pretty cool zombie short. It could have been just a little bit better, but it is still pretty good thanks to a few awesome scenes in it. This one gets a... 7/10TAPE 3 - ""Safe Haven"" This insane short is definitely the best out of the bunch. It is completely insane, bizarre, violent, and fun at the same time. Easily the most craziest, but enjoyable short I have ever experienced. If you see this film, make sure you watch this tape. It's long, but the crazy ending is worth it. This one gets a... 9.5/10TAPE 4 - ""Slumber Party Alien Abduction"" Well, the title of the tape speaks for itself. This short gets pretty fun and intense, but the most noticeable aspect about this tape, is the unique way that it's filmed. The camera is actually attached to the back of a dog, so we see what the dog sees and I had to give a big thumbs up for that. It's pretty creative and actually works out well enough. This tape will have you wondering what the f**k is going on but keep you thoroughly entertained. This one gets a... 8/10Wrap Around Tape/Frame Narrative - ""Tape 49"" As I said before, this is the story that plays on while the tapes are being watched. Two private investigators are searching for a missing college boy. They break into his house, search for him a little, then start to watch the tapes (which are the horror shorts) that he has. This story had a pretty clever twist in it that leads up to it's ending (which ends the whole film). This one gets a... 7/10OVERALL - 8/10.

This adaptation of Charles Willeford's 1971 novel carries the story to present and moves it from Florida to Lake Como, Italy. Under Capotondi's direction of the refreshed script everything works beautifully both in artistic and philosophical levels. The thin line between art world and underworld, questioning of art criticism, and ""reading"" of an art piece in terms of acquired notion and illusion are some of the intriguing points the movie provokes. James Figueras, an art critic willing to do literally anything to keep his fame and wealth (played by Danish actor Claes Bang) and American adventurer Berenice Hollis (Elizabeth Debicki) convey one of the most memorable performances and shine in the best screen chemistry I've seen in recent years. The other highlight is definitely Donald Sutherland as reclusive painter Jerome Debney who lives under care of an ambitious art collector Joseph Cassidy, a surprise cameo by Mick Jagger.

They were certainly a hot couple, and if they were crazy about each other, which reportedly they were, who can blame them? There is absolutely nothing special about the story, but the movie has some delightful musical numbers, including the title song - which has become part of the popular culture as it personifies everything Vegas.Colonel Parker wasn't happy about Viva Las Vegas because he felt that Ann-Margret was getting too many closeups in an Elvis Presley film. But without her sexy presence, the film would have lacked a lot of its energy.

A challenge comes in the shapely form of Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta Jones) who wants to marry (or preferably divorce) her way to riches. With Clooney hired to represent her soon to be ex husband, he inevitably falls for the gold diggers charms.Directed by the Coen brothers, a directorial team who have helmed oddball comedies such as 'Fargo' and 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' this is the team's first branch in to a high profile Hollywood film. Clooney, as the sharp suited lawyer, is excellent. Like Cary Grant or David Niven, Clooney is able to mock himself without compensating his screen appeal. Catherine Zeta Jones as the money hungry Marilyn is as sexy as her character demands from the scripted page. However, despite the quick fire dialogue, Intolerable Cruelty is simply not as funny as it thinks, it's cynical message of love and money taking away the romantic push it needs to place it in the league of the Tracy/Hepburn films the movie aspires to. Clooney's character also suffers from an over enthusiastic plot that later drives his character to attempt to commit a crime that totally contradicts the audiences perception of him. A battle of the sexes comedy that has sex appeal but no romance, Intolerable Cruelty is a film that reaches for the golden age of Hollywood but only touches the bronze.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ZlMjcyNjgtOWI4Zi00ZDUyLWE1Y2UtOTc5MDUzZDc2OTYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcwOTQzOTYy._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Some horror fans may find it too slow (it takes its sweet time to come to a climax) but it's worth it... the journey is entertaining and interesting.  This is a polished, professionally filmed movie with higher production values than the average for its genre.I've never seen a film before that went quite so in-depth into the subject of voodoo.  Filmed on location in Haiti, this movie goes into a lot of detail about various voodoo practices and introduces the voodoo versions of the good and evil magician, the houngon and the bocor.  If you have any interest at all in this subject matter (or the supernatural in general), I recommend the movie on that basis alone.Acting is uniformly solid throughout, if nothing really outstanding.  We do not come to care very deeply about these characters, so their trials, tribulations and deaths do not bother us much... but Craven's attention to detail really shows, and there isn't a moment of this movie that lacks entertainment value.  7/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjEzZjdjMzMtMGM5Mi00Y2JmLWFjYTEtYjcxNjA3NjdkNGQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I'd like to think I've been fairly hardened through the nineteen years I've lived. I can laugh at politically incorrect stuff. I find South Park quite humorous and satirical, rather than offensive and disgusting. It takes a lot to offend me. But this movie did. Dennis Dugan, continuing on the stroll he began with Saving Silverman which contained the biggest, most concentrated amount of misogyny in a single area, brings us one of the most racist films of newer time. Only, it's not what you'd immediately think; it's not racist against black people. Nope, it's against white people instead. As if that makes it any better. Hate and fascism is bad, regardless of where it's directed, which group or person is targeted by and for it. As pointed out on the message boards for this film, every bad guy in this film is white, and Lawrence's character plays the race card every other second in this movie. Now, let me make it absolutely clear; I don't hate anyone. I don't believe in hate. I have equal respect for everyone. I would have been just as offended had this movie targeted black people instead of white(the film would also have been shot down far quicker and more broadly), or if Saving Silverman had been hateful towards men, for that matter. The plot is pitiful. There was a scene in a courthouse that downright sickened me. The crowd was cheering as a victim of false allegations was attacked verbally and sentenced to jail-time... as if they were watching a sports event. The acting is OK. The humor was offending; most of it is Lawrence victimizing himself and berating white people. Both Zahn and Lawrence have been funny... what happened? There's not much else. I barely watched this film, because whenever I looked at the screen and paid attention to what was said, I was hit with an offending remark or action and felt a strong inclination to turn away, to concentrate my attention elsewhere. One to avoid. I don't really recommend this film to anyone... except for perhaps black extremists. Even most black people will most likely find this movie embarrassing and painfully stupid. And Dugan: so much hate... so much anger... have you considered seeking professional help? It can't be healthy. 2/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTgzZDQzNTQtY2NmMC00YTM1LWEwYmEtZGIwNmJmOTdiOTZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

A series of warped biographies on composers (Mahler, Tchaikovsky, List)incensed more than entertained audiences and critics. Laced with dark humor, vibrant costuming and Russell's sardonic use of the composers works in conjunction with his colorful and outlandish compositions the films were visual feasts that bordered on character assassination. In Valentino, Russell comes to America to offer his take on silent Hollywood and its biggest star of the era, Rudolph Valentino. Russell is relentless in his depiction of the exploitative and greedy nature of producers who in the opening scene stand over Valentino's body lamenting financial loss. Russell also works over newspaper reporters, actresses, Valentino's ex-wives and a comedian known as Fatty (Arbuckle?). Dancer, Rudolph Nureyev is no actor but as Valentino his poorly pronounced flatly emoted English fits and contributes to his sympathetic character. As in all Russell films there are scenes that are lush and grandly staged (ably assisted by ex-wife, Shirley Russell's original and over the top costuming) such as Leslie Caron's entrance at the funeral home, the fight sequence where ball room dancing takes place in between rounds, the producer with the pet gorilla in his living room, and a cult fan gathering outside Valentino's mansion. This film quickly sank from sight when it was released and thirty years later consensus remains the same. I personally believe however that Valentino is a sharply drawn dark humored satire that spits cynicism at two institutions (Hollywood and the media) that it depended heavily on for its success. Valentino succeeds on every level and that was probably its problem.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1ODcyMjQwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY1Nzg0NQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Years in the making, and has one foot in the blockbuster league which means it has to address a wide audience, satisfy investors and make a healthy recoupÃ¢ÂÂin the Chinese market, it did. What both these mean is that Kar Wai had to set up artificial limits to his vision, then swim to real ones, limits he cares to meet as an artist, then see how swiftly he can move back and forth.But let's not mince words here. Kar Wai is a cinematic master. And I'm sure I will remember this as one of the most interesting, most wonderful, most visual films of the year come December.Right off the bat, you should know that if you want the clean, rousing version of Ip Man you should go to the Donnie Yen films. It's a legend anyhow, most martial arts stories are (especially the Chinese), embellished in the telling. So if you want 'truth', you're looking in the wrong place to begin with. About Ip Man, you should know that the fighting style he is supposed to have originated called wing chun, at least as taught now, takes some old Taoist notions about softness and intuited flow and creates a uselessly complicated and scholastic system of study.But the notions are powerful, and this is likely what attracted Kar Wai to a film about him.So the artificial limits here are the kung fu movie, a type of narrative deeply embedded in the national character. So we get familiar history as the backdrop, Civil War, Japanese invasion and so forth. The film will be familiarly lush and operatic for the Chinese. It also means we get fights, we doÃ¢ÂÂsome marvelous ones. It means we get the heroic portraitÃ¢ÂÂthe good vs evil sifus, tied to contrasted history, tied to the passing of tradition. The kungfu plot revolves around preserving the secret 64 moves and avenging the old master's death, usual tropes in this type of film. But he sets all this up in order to break it, that's what Ip Man's talk about breaking the cake represents in his standoff with the old master of the northern school, contrasted to his belief that it should be wholeÃ¢ÂÂmetaphorically referring to a strong, unified China, the same obsession with fabricated harmony that powers both the political and martial arts narratives over there.This is what Kar Wai does, he breaks the harmonies. Not so much in the fights: Kar Wai plays with them like a master painter fools with paint in commissioned work. He plays with speeds, textures and choreographed impacts but does not radically push the language like he did in Ashes. Ashes really was a radical break in temporal experience, wonderful stuff with many layers. Here, we experience fights cleanly, in a way that will satisfy the broad audience.He breaks the heroic narrative: in his worldview, time does not linearly build to the 'big fight', it happens with one third of the film to go and Ip Man is not in it, what should have been a dramatic death happens offscreen, history is glimpsed off the streets, we get flashbacks and forwards, abstraction and long visual poetry. And the 64 moves are never passed on. All that fooling with structure is a way of loosening limits of genre and tradition, inherited limits to vision.But what is really worth it here, is watch him swim to meet his own limitsÃ¢ÂÂmultilayered reflection on memory as living space for the eye. In martial arts terms, that means soft, yielding to inner pull, to the hardness of fights, politics and quasi-mythical narrative. It means every hard narrative thrust in the name of tradition, country or lineage, becomes an anchor he uses to submerge me in visual exploration of feelings. In visitation of spaces of desire, flows. Sure, it is not as successful as previous projects, because the fancy fights and exotic settings get in the way, jarring me from a tangible experience. But it's still pretty much the same wonderful swimming, each thrust of the hand creating turbulent patterns in water.For instance, the daughter waiting in the train station to avenge the old master is the anchor. But between that first shot and the decisive encounter, we get a wonderful current of images; cooking smoke at night, snow, refracted light through windows, children running. These are not of the story, but snow flakes of remembrance the air drags in. The cut from statues of Buddha to grainy footage of bustling Hong Kong is one of the most thunderous edits I've seen. And the entire last third of the film is purely a Kar Wai film; all about unrequited yearnings, ashes of youth in a gilded box. So spliced inside the kung fu comic-book is a sort of Mood for Love where again we had the contrast to 'hard' fabrication in the writer of kung fu stories.It is muddled, because you can't have crispness when the whole point is a fluid recall. Tarkovsky is 'muddled'. But it's so lovely overall.The coveted moves as the excuse for the man and woman to meet attempting touch, the Taoist pushing and yielding of hands to be close.They are empty hand forms, in that there is nothing to be grasped beyond the shared flow. It is all about cultivating sensitivity, listening, placement in space.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTRiM2VmZTctY2Y0Ni00ZWJmLTg3MGUtMDA3ZmVkYWFkNzJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ2MTk1OTE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

And while Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas gets a perfect 10 from me, it still completely lacks plot. And so on.Arizona Dream, however, is different.The last movie I saw that was truly, in all aspects, perfect was Dog Day Afternoon, a 1975 true story starring Al Pacino and Chris Sarandon. For the longest time, it's been my obsession, my movified bible, everything other movies should aspire to be. And as of today, Dog Day Afternoon finally has competition in my personal top ten: Emir Kusturica's masterpiece very near surpasses Lumet's vision of captivating dialogue, insane details, and dodgy man-groping.Let's change the subject for a bit. Do you know the scene in Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys, where Bruce Willis is in his cage, and a hamster is running inside a wheel in the corner? Don't say yes, because you don't. It's inaudible. It's impossible to see. But it's there. Kusturica, much like Gilliam, is willing to make his world more detailed than your wildest dreams. His backgrounds are filled with symbolism and surrealism, his dark corners filled with soft puppies. And like Gilliam, he can make you cry with laughter, your only worry in the world being, 'how will I remember all these great quotes in the morning?'But unlike Gilliam, Kusturica has the power to, barely a scene after the happy happy joy, make you sit there in stunned silence, your number one worry in the world being, 'how will I get my brain to understand the sheer tragedy that is unfolding here?'. Your will find yourself thinking, 'how do I get my mind to comprehend how perfectly this music fits the dialogue?'. Your eyes will follow the camera angles, the expressions of the insanely lovable characters, the many things happening in foreground and background-and you know, you just KNOW, that you will have to watch the movie again, and again, and again.If you're a fan of movies such as Big Fish and AmÃÂ©lie, movies about people finding happiness and warmth in a world of surreal ambition, Arizona Dream will be your next obsession. But even if you think massive explosions and a grunting Bruce Willis are the only thing that can make a movie worth watching, you will still want to give this movie a chance- for the 'explosions' it causes will far, far surpass anything you've EVER experienced before.10/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjViZTgwMGUtNTJkNS00Mjg1LTkwZWQtNTg1YWEyOWFhY2I0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDQ2MTMzODA@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The acting is top notch, with Jim Caviezel, Faulkner, and Olivier Martinez really giving some nuanced and layered performances. Nobody phoned in their roles, you could sense a level of passion and commitment to the story. The music was also excellent, a gorgeous score that was paired with some nice cinematography and production design. The movie looked good and sounded, but importantly - it felt good.  Lots of films in the devotional genre tend to end up being mere dramatic recreations of the gospels, but this one, while delivering authenticity, was not as concerned with delivering a 'live-action experience of the Bible' so much as striving to express the true message of Paul. That message, the one that is basically Christ's Sermon on the Mount, is the crux of the film. This gives it an emotional heft that is quite poignant. I wasn't so moved by the characters' actions and the story in so much as what they were feeling in their hearts and what they were expressing.  Dammit this movie hit me right in the feels and I already know it will linger with me for days. That is a good sign that I just participated in some human art.  Won't win any Oscars, and sadly probably won't light up the box office but this is a fine and beautiful movie with an important and relevant message for the world today.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRkYTQ4NzctMDAwYS00NmE3LWI5NzUtMTMzNTQ0MDgwOWI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODQyOTY2OTA@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The family includes a grandfather (Kris Kristofferson), a son (Kurt Russell), his wife (Elisabeth Shue), and their daughter (Dakota Fanning). The son is a horse trainer and loses his job abruptly and takes with him a badly injured horse to his shrunken, empty, rundown horse farm.Just as the horse, Sonador, which is Spanish for Dreamer, struggles to become healthy, the family also struggles to become a caring, loving unit again. The indomitable spirit of the daughter as she cares for the horse forces the family to confront their problems. And ultimately they do face their problems with courage, spirit and even heroism.The acting in this movie by the family members was superb. But Dakota Fanning deserves a special mention.

I don't know whether its subconscious or what but the IMDb proves it; Almost everywhere I go, people seem to agree (at least movie lovers) that ""Aliens"" is even better than ""Alien"", yet ""Aliens"" is listed #85 on IMDb's top 250, ""Alien"" is #61. Then there is another masterpiece: ""The Godfather"", all though many people seem to agree that however great, ""The Godfather Part II"" is even better. Not so according to the votes from IMDb-users: ""The Godfather"" is #1, ""Part II"" is #4. ""Star Wars"" is #10, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is #15, and the list goes on and on. It's as if the general public goes into sequel-sucks-mode before they see the film and automatically would give it a lower grade no matter what. This also seems to be the case with ""Shanghai Knights"". Like many of my movie geek friends I thought the first film was great, but ""Shanghai Knights"" took me by great surprise and turned out to be even better, much more fun, better fights, greater villains, greater scenery, bigger plot, more film references, and I can go on. Still, it gets a 6,4 average while the first one gets a 6,7. Apparently it is one of the laws of physics that all though you personally feel a sequel outdoes the original, the masses would have you believe otherwise (the ""Toy Story""-movies being the exception that proves the rule).Well, we're all better off without the masses anyway. That's why nature invented things like the plague!Now to my review of ""Shanghai Knights"":I rarely laugh out loud to comedies unless it's Monty Python-type comedy filled with unpredictable insane humour, but ""Shanghai Knights"" had me in stitches several times. I really liked the first film, but the sequel is filled with references to everything you ever found fascinating about Britain and the charming duo of Chan and Wilson this time reaches its peak. But what really gets this film going is fight scenes like you've never seen them before! I am serious, I've watched Jackie Chan-films since I was a little kid and everyone knows he is the Buster Keaton of martial arts, but this time the fights ÃÂ choreographed by Jackie himself ÃÂ are so exhilarating to watch, boasting with playfulness to such a degree it leaves you dumbstruck in awe. All though it is apparent they used wires on some of the stunts, the mix of wire- and wireless stunts seem to balance themselves perfectly, giving a show fit for the greatest circus on Earth! It is hard to put to words the sheer delight it is to watch Jackie Chan (now close to 50!) beating up a gang of crooks while at the same time doing an homage to Gene Kelly and ""Singin' in the Rain""! It gave me that rare sensation I remember getting the first time I saw Chaplin perform the ""dance of the rolls"" in the ""Gold Rush"", Buster Keaton caught in the middle of that hurricane in ""Steamboat Bill Jr."" or when Donald O'Connor ran up the wall in ""Singin' in the Rain"". It is a rare cinematic treat, created by and performed to excellence by Jackie Chan, again underlining what a rare and unique screen artist he is and how grateful we should be for him risking his back to give us that joy. People who still think of him as only a martial arts artist should take a hike. He's been a legend in his own right for close to two decades, one of the greatest entertainers of his generation (if not THEE greatest) so I ask you this: when will they give him an Honorary Academy Award!? I am sure Chaplin, Keaton and Gene Kelly would have supported this wholeheartedly, had they been alive today!A great deal is also owed to the writing pair of Alfred Gough and Miles Millar (Made Men, Spider-Man 2) who pepper the story with quirky charm ÃÂ the type Chan & Wilson seem born to play, once in a while serving up hysterical one-liners that should crack up anyone with an IQ over 50 (the best one has to be the subtitle after one of the characters has an encounter with Jack the Ripper).Not surprisingly many of the people with an IQ *under* 50 bothered to fill the Goof-section up with all the factual errors in ""Shanghai Knights"" when it is just the thing you have to expect from a crazy comedy of this kind. For as long as I can remember I've enjoyed British history, I know the first real automobile wasn't invented until 1889, I'm a big fan of the Jack the Ripper-legend who terrorized London in 1888, I love the work of Chaplin who was born in 1889, I know Arthur Conan Doyle was originally a doctor of optometry, but not once did I mind all these things clashing in 1887's London, it is pure fantasy and should be enjoyed as such. Wonderful escapism played to perfection by great talent in front of and behind the camera. The writers didn't intend to re-create history, they just did as Jackie Chan would do in a fight: take every thing available and throw it in to make it more entertaining to the viewer! Then again there are people who have NO relation to any of the above-listed things and not surprisingly they won't find ""Shanghai Knights"" that entertaining. Which is really sad, for if you love movies you should *really* learn to love history as well, as the two can make a fabulous pair whether it is done in the name of fantasy or fiction. Of course director David Dobkin also deserves special praise for never letting the heart and soul of the film getting lost in all the commotion.I didn't mention Owen Wilson in all this, but don't get me wrong, he's great as usual. Wilson and Chris Tucker (Rush Hour) has to be the greatest thing happening to Jackie Chan since he discovered the art of mixing comedy with martial arts. And of course the supporting actors deserves mentioning, especially Aidan Gillen who makes a wonderful sneaky upper-class villain (named Rathbone, not exactly the most inventive referance to Hollywood ÃÂ legendary actor Basil Rathbone - but still wonderful the same) and Aaron Johnson as a kid who looks and acts like he was just pulled out of ""Oliver!"" with great conviction (a scene where Wilson tells him of for being a an orphan is both heartbreaking and side-splittingly funny at the same time). Fann Wong also does a great English language-speaking film debut as Jackie Chan's sister.To sum it all up; leaving me laughing to the point of exhaustion, ""Shanghai Knights"" is one of this years most pleasant surprises!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg3N2IwNWMtODkwNi00NTE1LWI4MzMtYzI5ZDU4MGE4NjBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcwOTQzOTYy._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Once he does, he doesn't die but goes to a place where others who have committed suicide live as well. It's a bizarre tale of love, friendship, and the afterlife told through the eyes of director Goran Dukic and is based on the short story ""Kneller's Happy Campers"" by Etgar Keret. A funny, strange but very original film ensuesÃÂ I had the pleasure of being able see this film at the Philadelphia Film Festival earlier tonight and I was glad that I got the opportunity to see such an original and creative film which so few will ever see. While this movie may actually be too dark or weird for some audiences, I personally loved it. It's been a long time since I have seen a romantic comedy that is this unique and this original. The plot for the movie is so bizarre that your eyes and brain are glued to the screen the entire time.This movie puts a whole new spin on the idea of a romantic comedy and does it flawlessly. All the characters seem to connect as they interact with each other. The movie seems to be a mix of the movie ""Interstate 60"" and the work of writer Hunter S Thompson. The movie at times is very dark and odd but it only adds to the originality and creative minds behind the film.When watching this film, just sit back and enjoy the ride. This film takes you to a world that you have never seen before. Who would ever think you would see a movie about a world that exists only to those who have committed suicide? And the funniest thing is it's the same thing as our world but a few minor differences. This is a movie that relies on imagination, something we as adults seem to forget to use anymore. This movie challenges Hollywood to take risks and go beyond the typical storyline and into something more creative and out of the ordinary.The acting in this film is very solid. Patrick Fugit who I feel is always underrated as an actor really does a great job in this film. I mean you think after movies like ""Almost Famous"" and ""Saved!"" his career would have taken off but oddly enough it hasn't yet. Regardless of his career, I think he did a great job with the material given to him. Also Shannyn Sossamon who played Mikal did a great job as well. Again I think she is another actress who has potential. She hasn't had a great breakout performance as of yet but I feel she has the potential to be big and when she does land that breakout role, she will be. Shea Whigham who played Eugene was very amusing. I enjoyed him as the crazy sidekick to Zia. And finally just because I think the guy is a riot and since half the audience started to laugh when they saw him appear on screen I must give credit to Will Arnett (GOB from Arrested Development) who appeared on screen for way to short of a role in my opinion. What made his role stand out was the fact that so many people recognized him as GOB on ""Arrested Development"" which as he came on screen near the end of the film, half the theater laughed and clapped. There are several others I haven't mentioned here but they all did a fine job as well.Director and writer Goran Dukic did a great job on this film especially since it was his first feature film. As the audience talked with Mr. Dukic during the Q&A I found out that a lot of this film was taken directly from the short story but the way he brought the film alive was amazing. I honestly think this is probably one of the most original and creative films I have seen in the theater in the last year or so. And Mr. Dukic does a fine job directing this film and capturing this bizarre world.In conclusion, if you're a fan of dark comedies I highly recommend this film. If you like movies that dare to be different I recommend you see this film. Honestly, I don't know the target audience for this film but it's definitely a must for those who want to see something original and different from the norm. It's a fine first film from director and writer Goran Dukic and it puts a new spin on the romantic comedy genre and all the things we will do for love. I would have to say it's probably the second best film I seen all year maybe not for being powerful or moving but for being really original and creative.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Wristcutters: A Love Story"" is a 9/10. A must see for those who love creative and dark stories or like movies that go beyond the norm.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU3NTRhYWYtZWI3YS00NTZjLTliMWUtNTIyMGQ1MzliMjFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The plot in both films is fairly simple and straightforward. After a plane crash lands in the Gobi Desert, the survivors hit upon the notion of rebuilding the damaged vehicle in the hopes of flying it back to civilization. Dennis Quaid assumes the role, originally filled by Jimmy Stewart, of the pilot who, against all odds, endeavors to lead his passengers to safety.Although the new version follows the original fairly closely in terms of both character delineation and plot development, the story doesn't seem quite as fresh today as it did when we first encountered it close to 40 years ago. Perhaps what's missing is the guiding hand of a master craftsman like Aldrich to really deliver the goods (John Moore, a far less distinguished director, is manning the controls here). This ""Flight"" feels awfully predictable and rote, as we plow our way through each of the various survival threats, rescue attempts and internecine personal conflicts that are standard in all such tales of survivors stranded in a hostile environment. Each of the characters steps out of the shadows to have his or her own Moment in the Sun (yes, in this version, there is actually a woman aboard), before receding dutifully into the background to allow the next person to do the same. About the only intriguing element in the story is the fact that the main character, the pilot of the plane, has to actually be talked into participating in the Quixotic rescue plan. Thus, he is a leader and a hero more by default than by design.Although the crash itself is fairly impressive from a technical standpoint - despite a rather phony-looking, computer-generated sandstorm that brings the plane down - once we end up on the desert floor, the movie doesn't do a particularly effective job conveying the truly grueling nature of the predicament these individuals are facing. We never really get the sense that they are just a few water droplets away from dying of thirst or heatstroke. Moreover, the feat that they are able to accomplish seems barely credible - from a sheer mechanical engineering standpoint - given the lack of resources and expertise with which the group has to cope. The main weakness with a film like ""Flight of the Phoenix"" is that, when the plane goes down, we're stuck in the desert right along with the characters, and if they don't have anything particularly interesting to say to one another, we can feel just as stranded as they.Thus, despite a few quality moments, this ""Flight"" never manages to get off the runway. Check out the original instead.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyMjY4MzcwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQ5MzcyMQ@@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The rest of the cast exists to point the way to the inevitable.The philandering, materialistic, self absorbed husband/father illuminates the barren marriage.The fumbling sexual attempts of the son with the girl next door and her contradictory accusations of his sexual attempts as either too rough or not rough enough (gay), understandably confuse the son and provide the mother with a mentoring, nurturing sexual role for her son about how to sexually succeed with women.The mother, stumbling upon a bedroom sexual session between the son and the girl next door, reacts more in jealousy than in any maternally disproving fashion.The mother's flirtatious ways with the male neighbors, doctors, and ultimately with the girl next door's father point out that while she may be her son's mother, she is still a very desirable woman in the eyes of the rest of the male world.From the beginning through the end, you never believe the son and mother ever had a mother/child bonding. Both of them are intellectually superior, highly educated. The mother was young when she gave birth and she thinks of herself as her son's educational, intellectual and ultimately sexual mentor, not his mother.The teenage son's inability to ""spank his monkey"" combined with the boredom, liquor and medications downed by his mother provide the explosive elements that are just waiting to be lit. The mother's seductive smile and a slight hiking of her nightgown set off the explosion.This movie is nowhere near perfect, but it's compelling enough to let you sit through the unnecessary (e.g. stoner friends) and that's a lot more than you can say for most movies with a budget that is a thousand times greater.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTcxZTlhY2MtMmI4Ni00NTQxLTllMDItZDVlYmUxZTI0MTIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This movie is far more than anti-war.Because it is not a rich story ,but a rich truth and an emotion. It doesn't want to give you an opinion about what war is, but show you an emotion about a young man and a war. A so-called hero came back from Iraq, how is his life?In the real world, the truth and emotion are complicated. So it is hard to say what its theme is. Maybe the theme is to doubt our fake society Maybe the theme is to show the hero's confused life. However, they are parts of this movie. It is more like a section of Billy's life. He has family,battle companion, stranger and girlfriends. Sometimes he is distracted at his important moment,sometims all in front of him remind him of war. He sees and thinks.He might find that life is difficult to choose,finally he go back to the place where he belongs.If you can feel you are Billy Lynn, you can feel how ridiculous this society is.Nobody understands you,people see what they want to see.the sad thing is, you can change nothing but follow the direction of fate.If you don't have sensory substitution,this movie is boring.From the beginning of Billy's halftime showÃ¯Â¼Â I can't help crying.

"Florence Foster Jenkins","2024.0","U","111.0","Biography, Comedy, Drama","6.8","71.0","Stephen Frears","Meryl Streep, Hugh Grant, Simon Helberg, Rebecca Ferguson","59,633","The story of Florence Foster Jenkins, a New York heiress who dreamed of becoming an opera singer, despite having a terrible singing voice.","169","A gently comedic story of love and deceit.","Perpetuating little white lies is part of everyday life and keeps society ticking over. But to what point is it acceptable to massage an ego with a dirty black lie. A real whopper. And is such a lie perpetuated by love? Greed? Or the pursuit of personal glory? This is the rather subtle sub-text behind the story of Florence Foster Jenkins.Based on a true story, Florence Foster Jenkins tells the story of a truly awful singer (Meryl Streep), cossetted in her closed world of a 1944 New York hotel and pampered by her husband St Clair Mayfield (Hugh Grant), who is otherwise entwined with the sensuous Kathleen (Rebecca Ferguson). Together with ex-actor Mayfield, the wealthy Florence is the co-star of the show at her self-owned ""Verdi Club"" where she has a non-speaking role enacting various 'tableau' scenes. But in the interests of following her dreams she recruits the help of famous singing instructor Carlo Edwards (the marvellous David Haig) and an enthusiastic and personable young pianist Cosme McMoon (Simon Helberg, ""The Big Bang Theory""). Carlo is aware of what he is in for (he wants to keep the arrangement 'on the quiet'); Cosme is not (to great comic effect).This classic re-telling of 'The Emperor's New Clothes' ultimately takes us on a journey to a packed concert at the Carnegie Hall, where many of the tickets have been given away to rowdy and drunk servicemen. It's impossible to describe a film as ""delightfulÃÂ just delightful"" without hearing the velvety tones of Hugh Grant saying those words. But that's what it is. A treat of moving and at times wildly funny storytelling from director Stephen Frears (""Philomena"", ""The Queen"") that just works from beginning to end.Meryl Streep is just glorious in the titular role, oozing charm. Those UK readers will probably fondly remember the piano playing 'skills' of the late, great comedian Les Dawson (google it for a youtube clip) who had to be an absolutely brilliant pianist to be able to deliberately play so badly. In a similar way, we know (from the likes of ""Mamma Mia"") that Streep knows how to belt out a good tune, so it requires some considerable skill to deliver Florence's songs as well (or as badly) as she does. Bravo Ms Streep, Bravo!And Hugh Grant is often quite unfairly criticized for playing Hugh Grant in every movie (as if Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford are much different?), but here he turns in a totally sterling performance. The drivers behind Mayfield's character are never totally clear (and I won't spoil that here), but in the final reel the motivating factor becomes crystal clear, and Grant has never been better. (Bravo Mr Grant, Bravo!).To round off the accolades for the lead performances, Simon Helberg turns in a genius comic performance as the goggle-eyed pianist, who lights up every scene he's in and delivers his lines (e.g. one about a naval encounter) with perfect comic timing. Shining again in a supporting role is Rebecca Ferguson (""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"") who once again is dazzling. Among the bright young acting newcomers of the likes of Vikander and Rooney, Ferguson (who is approaching her mid-30s) brings a level of sophisticated glamour and maturity to the screen that is strongly reminiscent of the great starlets of the 1940's and 50's like Kathrine Hepburn or Lana Turner. She is fast becoming one of my favourite actresses. Also worthy of note is Nina Arianda as gold- digging starlet Agnes Stark Ã¢ÂÂ effectively playing (at least at first) the ""little boy in the crowd"" in the Emperor's fable.Written by TV-writer Nicholas Martin in his big-screen debut, the story is slowly and subtly unwoven, only progressively revealing the plot points in an intelligent manner. Other screenwriters take note: this is how to do it.Cinematography is by the great Danny Cohen (""The Danish Girl""; ""Room"") and with the Production Design, Costuming and Special effects crew 1940's New York is vibrantly brought to life. While the film's leisurely pace might make the younger set fidgety, this is a treat particularly for older viewers looking for a great night out at the cinema. The film got a good old-fashioned round of applause at my showing when the credits came up. ""DelightfulÃÂ just delightful"".

One of Roberta Collins' finest movie moments!","What a great movie!  An entertaining female ""Great Escape""!  Roberta Collins, Pam Grier and Sid Haig in particular are real hoots with some great moments and dialogue. Bodine (Pat Woodell) is a great character too (introduced as someone not to be messed with), especially letting loose with twin machine guns in the final gunfight. Lots of fun to be had in Jack Hill's Women In Prison exploitation classic. See Matilda The Hun and Foxy Brown themselves duke it out and mud wrestle. Ponder as to how someone so skinny (whereas the resident junkie is quite healthy) got to be head guard. The obligatory prison breakout relies on the help of one prisoner's pet cat to come through at the right time. The scenes with the junkie being completely out her tree are hilarious, although she also gets to show her creepier, more deranged side too in some scenes. The prison break attempt and the final gunfight with the authorities are fun and exciting stuff and for me Roberta Collins steals the show. Not content with the aforementioned mudwrestle with prison bully Pam Grier, she gets some male action at knifepoint and gets great revenge on the evil prison governess. Roberta has some great dialogue too in ""Get it up or I'll cut it off!"" and ""Bye bye lardass!""  The head guard has a slight Barbara Steele resemblance. The ending is a bit rushed, some character's fates are left up in the air and the dialogue that seals Judy Brown's fate was a dub forced on the film but it's still great fun and was a groundbreaking hit for AIP. Roberta, Pam and Judy had all just been in ""Women In Prison"" beforehand and Jack Hill later also directed Pam Grier in some of the blaxploitation flicks that made her an icon. Roberta Collins would of course go onto starring in the masterpiece ""Death Race 2000"" and the inferior (in my opinion) prison classic ""Caged Heat"".  As you'd expect from this type of movie, there are chances to see attractive women getting naked or scantily clad and you get amusing foodfights and catfights.  The female leads are obviously in on the joke though and have fun with it.  There's some amusing moments and unlike the ""Charlie's Angels"" tv show, these resourceful, smart women really do get a chance to kick ass and get tough.  Classic feelgood exploitation!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWIxZGUxN2UtZjE4Mi00NjVlLWI4ODMtNTgzMzhkZGY4ODgxL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I'm a straight gal, but these actresses represented all the nuances that every couple (regardless of sexual orientation) can experience: clinginess, irrational jealousy, unexplainable sadness, family anger that trickles down into every day life, desire for space and breathing room, and very real arguments about music. I love that the movie represented two extremes of the human spectrum -- one person who is vivacious and care-free, and one person who is a little more mild and guarded.

It seems that all is hopeless, until she bumps into Mark Kendall.","58","Decent if you're in the mood for a light comedy","Lauren Hutton is a vampire simply named ""The Countess"" who must bite a virgin three times per year (ending on Halloween) in order to retain her youth and beauty. However, living in California in the mid-1980s, it's becoming impossible to find a virgin.This is a horror comedy that's not exactly atmospheric, thrilling or suspenseful (it's also completely free of gore), and not exactly hilarious. Rather, it's just a very lighthearted, mostly enjoyable film that happens to be about vampires, although it's primarily interesting for a one of the earliest, pre-fame appearances of Jim Carrey, and for nostalgia, as Once Bitten is firmly mired in mid-1980s pop culture.The biggest flaw is that the mythology behind the film is not very well explained or followed. The Countess finds Mark Kendall (Carrey) fairly easily, but we're not shown her and her clan looking very hard until just before Halloween--they had all year. We're never told if the clan has to follow the same rules. It doesn't seem so in the end, but why not? It's never very clear why The Countess can't just go after, say, an eleven year old. When things are getting down to the wire near the climax of the film, there are other virgins around, but The Countess just ignores them as potential drinking fountains of youth. It seems like maybe she has to bite the same person, rather than three potentially different people, three times, but that's never directly stated. How long does it have to be between bites? Why couldn't she just bite the one person twice, then bite someone else three times within a few hours? Although I don't usually like to try to apply real world logic to films, in this case, I couldn't help it. Once Bitten isn't meant solely as a comedy, and there is a long sequence during the climax that should be as suspenseful as it is humorous. But the suspense was gone, because all I could think of where the questions above instead. To make it worse, the timeline of the film gets a bit muddled, and we lose any sense of when Halloween night is actually occurring. At one point, during a Halloween dance, that seems like that should be Halloween night, but then it seems like Halloween should be over already at a later point. At that later point, it seems like the dance must have been on a different, earlier day. That this crucial fact for suspense in the film isn't clear is a problem. Once Bitten suffers from sloppy scriptwriting and sloppy direction from Howard Storm, whose resume shows that he's much more comfortable with half-hour television sitcoms.But if one can overlook some of those flaws, Once Bitten is worth at least one viewing. Carrey's performance is good. He easily shows why he became a star in later films. His transformation over the course of the film is great, and a scene with Carrey in full vampire make-up and clothing makes one long to see a serious vampire film with him as a star. I also liked the ice cream truck and took it as a nod to Phantasm (1979). There are enough comic moments that most viewers will at least be occasionally smiling, if not laughing out loud. A scene where Mark's friends are trying to check him for evidence of vampirism is a standout, as is much of the material where Mark and his friends interact. Carrey's scenes with his parents are even better, but there are too few of them. Both Hutton and Karen Kopins (as Mark's girlfriend, Robin) are sensuous. The Countess' vampire clan is severely underused, but they are okay when they do appear. And even the obligatory mid-80s music video/dance scene is mostly tolerable.I also enjoyed the subtext that sex is a means of protection from evil, rather than something dangerous to be avoided. Robin's attitude about Mark's relationships was also a nice change of pace.This is definitely a film that needs to be approached with lowered expectations, but in the right mood, you just might enjoy it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjkxOWQ2MWItNWQ4Zi00MWRjLTkwYWUtYTBmMmYwOTUzZDgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This is one of them.This touching film is about daring caveman Atouk and his brave companion Lar, who are expelled from their tribes, journey through exotic, precambrian lands, learning about the people and world around them. Ultimately they form their own tribe and, more importantly, learn cameraderie, the heart of what it means to be human and to have love. Caught up in the chaos of a savage, ancient world, Atouk and Lar eventually have to struggle just to stay alive.This movie lost the Best Picture Oscar in 1981, but history will likely remember ""Caveman"" for much longer. And with more fondness. The cinematography is excellent. Alan Hume's prehistoric world is photographed as a mystical paradise. Then, we see the horror of human greed, lust and cruelty, also stunningly photographed. There is also a nice scene with a bunch of people thrashing about in a large pile of dung. It looked so realistic, that for a moment, I felt like it wasn't a movie, but a documentary.The acting is top notch, especially early performances from Dennis Quaid, who exposes his buttocks and Barbara Bach, who should have. In one scene, Dennis Quaid makes impressive use of method acting, urinating against a glacier. And Ringo Starr deserved the Oscar he unfairly lost to Dudley Moore that year.Everyone needs to see this movie at least once. Although it might be a little disturbing, the violence is not gratuitous, the love affairs wistful and heartbreaking. Despite the tragic elements, however, the movie is inspirational. One of the best films to come out of the 80s!It's underrated films like this that don't get any publicity and the over-rated, pointless films do. I guess that's just the way Hollywood operates. This is one of the saddest, most touching, most unsettling, most moving films I've ever seen. It's one of the best. It nakedly shows the rudimentary nature of humanity, by showing our primal origins, when a fire, meat and the warmth of a lover and support of friends was all that kept us from the brink of death. ""Caveman"" captures and horrifies the viewer. There is something classical about the plot of ""Caveman."" If Aeschylus was alive today and making films, he would have made ""Caveman.""The vivid imagery and music is outstanding, but the acting and intensity shown is very realistic. This is one of the most harrowing, gripping films I've ever seen, reminding me of so many other films of the era. ""Quest for Fire"" being one, but ""The Killing Fields"" being another. ""The Killing Fields"" is a movie about people who weren't exactly on the front lines, nor are they exceptional warriors. They're everyday people, like you or me, who do what they can to help one another out. ""Caveman"" is like this.I can't put my finger on exactly what it is about this film that gets to me so much, but it is THE most haunting, emotional film experience one could hope for.Excellent performances from the cast. A brilliant score by Lalo Schifrin. Scenes of high emotion, tension, drama, horror and even one or two pieces of light relief, usually involving Shelly Long.An excellent film. Certainly one of the best foreign films in recent memory, ""Caveman"" is ripe for a new Director's Cut edition, or perhaps a modern English-version remake featuring John Malkovich. I have only ever seen the original, undubbed and not-subtitled version (I never figured out what language it was -- probably Swedish) and had difficulty with some of the more elaborate dialogues.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3ODcxYzQtMjM0Mi00ZWU4LThlYTMtMzI0YTFlZmIxZjcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUxNjc5NjY@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He already won two Oscars and nominated for at least 5 times. This movie's theme is boxing and this a biography movie. So my expectation was very high and for me, it is a highly anticipated movie because Robert de Nero starring Raging bull is also a boxing- themed movie which's success is known by all. But this movie is pathetic. Total mess and very poor performance by all the lead cast. I think the biggest flaw of this movie is the script. very poorly written and may be not researched well by its contents. It is a biography movie and there are lots of opportunities to show plots and subplots with interesting incidents. You have to choose the best true incidents with transparent history, not the fantasy. But there are no such things in this movie which will be interesting or transparent. The most important thing of a sports biography movie is its twist or the turning points which are completely missing in this movie. The story writer surely missed the opportunities to show the actual suspense and the originality. This is the story of Roberto DurÃÂ¡n Samaniego (born June 16, 1951), he is a Panamanian former professional boxer regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time his nickname is ""Manos de Piedra"" (""Hands of Stone""). He won many historic matches and in these matches, there are lots of thrill and suspense. At least 15 incidents in his life are happened which are turning points of his career and for his life also. I cannot spoil this and cannot reveal for the known reason. The script and the screenplay are written in a very lazy way and they missed these incidents. The direction is not up to the mark and the director completely failed to maintain the pace which is very important for a biographical drama movie. The script is poorly written and at least 5-6 times I failed to follow the subplot. Content could have been better and the theme is very confusing for realizing and several subplots created over the top impacts.Watch at your own risk and It will be good if you expect nothing from this biographical drama.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxNzE4ODU1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA4Njk0ODE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In fact, to put it bluntly I totally loathe them. (I prefer movies that at least try to have a cohesive plot line with a reasonably accessible story idea and some decent tight pacing; ie: something that's both informative and fun. This is my interpretation of the classic idea of ""a good story, well told"".)With that in mind, I wish to state that this movie (film, whatever) really does work, at all levels. It's a good intelligent story (apparently based on fact} about a very bright, very young kid who is discovered to be naturally good at chess and enters the serious national tournaments. During which time, there are raised issues of the concept of the winning ethos; and keeping (or losing) your humanity in the process.This cast is magnificent here. The central leads are played by Joe Mantegna and Max Pomerance as the father and son respectively. Both give very well-balanced performances. Sensitive, without being sappy. Max in particular is very good, especially in the dramatic climax of the film; which he handles with total dignity. It could have been so over the top and patronizing in lesser hands, but this time it isn't.They are ably supported by Laurence Fishburne and Ben Kingsley as two different types of coaches, from ""opposite side of the tracks"" (sorry for that old clichÃÂ©). It may seem formulaic, but in this case the dramatic contrasts works surprisingly well, and both come over as intelligent representatives of their particular points of view. And there are also great character moments by David Paymer {QUIZ SHOW, MR Saturday NIGHT, etc} and Hal Scardino {THE Indian IN THE CUPBOARD} as well.Over all, I would highly commend this film as the type of story that manages to tread the fine line between intelligent ideas and an entertaining story.

The film centres on Michael Stone, a depressed customer service guru who struggles to connect with others, finally meeting someone he can truly connect with - a woman named Lisa.Anyone familiar with Kaufman's work knows that he has a tendency to write incredibly deep and complex stories embedded with a plethora of themes. ""Anomalisa"" might just be the one exception (or anomaly) to that fact. The story is surprisingly simple; most of it takes place over the course of 24 hours. The messages behind it, fortunately, will still require multiple viewings and further analysis in order to be fully grasped. The final synthesis is elegantly woven to near perfection and is at times humorous and even thrilling. Running at only 90 minutes, the film never feels slow nor bloated. I believe ""Anomalisa"" is a good starting point for those just starting to get into Kaufman's filmography.The stop-motion animation is some of the best that I have ever seen on the big screen. For a project that was funded on Kickstarter, I have to say that the quality of the animation is the equivalent to what you would see in an Aardman Animations or Laika production - if not better. There were certain shots that made me stop and really appreciate the efforts that the team went through just to make all of their characters' movements flow realistically. Kudos to them!The reasons why I think ""Anomalisa"" is one of this year's most important films not only have to do with the way the film was financed and produced, but that it also opens up a dialogue on isolation and social disillusionment - they are usually seen as flaws inherent only within the individual, despite the fact that everyone plays some part in furthering it.""Anomalisa"" is a true work of art on many levels. It is a simple story that touches on a wide range of emotions, riddled with the complexities of our perceptions on relationships. Do not be surprised if this film makes you laugh more than cry. Do not be surprised if this film makes you cry more than laugh - for that is the true beauty of this anomaly of a film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMzI2MzQ1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg0MzQxNzE@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He is forced to use his unstoppable form of martial arts to destroy the corrupt officials and their lackeys.","141","Gore epic.","Close second to ""Dead Alive"" as goriest film ever made. Rivers of ridiculously over-exaggerated red will fill your screen and turn your stomach.Riki was just an innocent (though super-powered, think Mr. Incredible) youth until the day his girlfriend was killed in a botched rape attempt by gangsters. After dealing out his bloody revenge he is carted off to prison where he wishes to serve his sentence as peacefully and undisturbed as he can. However, this pseudo sci-fi Asian prison is any thing but peaceful. Prison film clichÃÂ©s ensue (ie. corrupt guards, an evil warden, an escape attempt).Technically speaking, the movie isn't very good. The sets lack believability, the dialogue is pretty horrible, and the acting is way over board. The bad guys seem to be bad because they can be...either that or they are just bored, one or the other. Outside of Riki, there is no background attached to any of the characters and none of them are ever developed properly. Additionally, the plentiful fight scenes aren't choreographed very well. Top it all off with some of the cheesiest kung-fu dubs ever recorded and you have a film suffering from lack of talent.So why the positive score? This is a damn fun movie, that's why. Each and every fight scene ends with a gory display of gruesome blood letting. Heads crushed, stomachs torn open, eyes popped out, faces cut off, one villain even tries to strangle Riki with his own intestines. Amidst the crimson flow, the dumb-as-a-brick story is awash in unintentional humor; the more serious it takes itself the funnier it is. Even the gore itself makes for a joke, it's so over the top it ceases to offend and becomes a sight gag.Main stream viewers will not get this movie and will simply not like it. Genre fans, however, will find the holy grail of gore flicks.8/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmU0ODhkMzYtYjdhYy00ODhiLWEyYjItNDk4YzIwZDJlN2I2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzgzODI1OTE@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Director Peter Markle, working with a magnificent cast, headed by Gene Hackman and Danny Glover, does wonders to recreate this story of valor under the worst possible circumstances.The cinematography is excellent. The film relies on visual effects, that are not to be confused with the incredible special effects that we have seen in other movies. Yes, of course, we all know that they are special, but the movie relies in the interplay between the missing Col. Hambleton on the ground and Capt. ""Bird Dog"" Clark who had the courage to stay focused, first in his plane, and later in the helicopter as he searches for this man, who he didn't even know. It's a tribute that these two military men in caring for one another in a difficult situation. Gene Hackman is an actor that always project convincing character. His take on the colonel is the real thing. Danny Glover, on the other hand, is on target. He demonstrates he has what it takes to hold it against big stars, like Mr. Hackman, or in his films with Mel Gibson. He is a joy to watch in his portrayal of a man who is an honest professional.For fans of action war movies, this is a more real approach to the genre thanks to the vision of its director Peter Markle.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVjOTZjMDUtY2ZiOS00N2Y3LTlhYzgtMzcxMDdjZmNhMzE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The fact that it presents the message it has with a hammer doesn't hide the fact that as a film it is just shallow. It is exactly what the title says. It's about a group of climate change activists that plan and carry out the disabling of an oil pipeline in Texas. The problem is that the characters are paper thin. They are just a collection of grievances and slogans, not three dimensional people. I have watched many films like this where I may not agree with the cause or politics of the characters but at least in better movies of this kind I can relate or at least empathize with at least one or some of them. Even though this film uses flashbacks to set up the characters you don't get to know any of them. Those scenes are used to set up and justify their actions which we know is the blowing up of the pipeline. There is no suspense because I didn't care for characters. They are just stereotypes as opposed to fleshed out characters. Each character seems like a bumper sticker representing a particular grievance. This film wants the audience to think about how deep the message is but fails to create compelling characters to support the ambitions of their message.The film is well made but is content with not really delving into the subject it wants to represent.

I enjoy the romantic comedy genre, so I gave it a shot.I won't say that Picture Perfect was completely awful because I did watch it all the way through. I will say that this film paints humanity in an ugly light.Kate is utterly self-centered, showing the total lack of awareness of others. The entire film is predicated on the decisions she makes out of her self-centeredness. Even the ""happy ending"" depends on Kate's lack of awareness for anyone else but herself. It doesn't occur to her that she's ruining a stranger's wedding because she can't wait 30 minutes to get out her apologies. The film's writer insults the viewer by assuming that because Kate manages a few tender moments while she's being selfish, we then are supposed to be endeared to her.Nick shows no dignity for his own self. The more he gets to know the self-centered Kate, the more he falls in love with her?? She insults him with her proposal, she is disrespectful and rude to him, she shows weak moral character by her ""affair"" with a colleague who is using her for thrill-sex... and yet, he professes that he likes her more and more. The viewers are expected to endear ourselves to him too.Kate's colleague, played by Kevin Bacon, only sleeps with women who are married or otherwise committed. Enough said.Kate's boss only shows his female staff respect based on whether or not they are ""stable"", which in this case is determined by whether or not Kate is showing signs that she's in a committed relationship.Kate's friend encourages her to lie and cheat in order to fool her boss into thinking she's ""stable"".Kate's mom is portrayed as an overbearing mother whose self-worth depends on the constant reassurance that her daughter cares about her.Kate's other work colleagues are portrayed as gossip-mongering and thoughtless.Don't be tempted to watch this. Whether it's intended or not, the film ends up being a commentary about the inherent selfishness of and lack of self-dignity in humanity.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2UwN2E0ZGItYmM3NC00ODVkLTkxOGItNGQ1NDMxMDdiMjQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

'Un beau matin' is a very honest and beautiful movie, not bound by time or space. It's a timeless story.The movie is especially good because the storyline is disarmedly strong and honest, with restrained emotions.The film is made even more beautiful and stronger by the many silent moments between the dialogues. There is also not too much talking, which I always like a lot.The expression on Lea Seydoux's face, who plays Sandra (a widow and mother of one daughter), says a lot more than some emotional tantrum.And then there is the wonderful music of Schubert and the recurring beautiful music of Jan Johansson.

It does so because most men won't want to admit they like a love story, or go to the movies to see one. This movie is a top rate love story, from beginning to end. What possibly could this movie have in common with Fight Club,,or even As Good as it Gets? In Fight Club, Ed Norton meets a girl that he obviously can not handle , so he reinvents himself. Same with Ben Shockley. He meets his match, so he must act quickly, making up a story about snakes at the cave. He then thinks on his feet, and acquires himself a bike, impressing the girl and cementing their alliance. Jack Nicholson breaks down to Helen Hunt and claims ""You make me want to be a better man"".Estwood starts saying please, and and emotes a deep trust in his counterpart; He realizes he must soften up a little to keep the lady around.He does. Shockley isn't some phony Top Gun hero who loses the girl, he's a loser who does what he has to get the woman in love with him, and it works, this is his only chance at love.This is Lockes best film. Is it because of the acting or is this Lockes personality? She does it well enough where you honestly believe she is ad libbing at least half of her lines, pulling them off the top of her tongue. She sizzles, oozing sex in the back seat of the cop car. You honestly believe she is so used to verbal abuse that she sits there and takes the insults. She is just playing possum, lying in wait. She takes her turn, and delivers a knockout counter-punch to the constable,forcing his mind to admit that he is just a sleazeball flunkie. What is best, is that nothing but honesty and cold reality come out of her mouth. Eastwood accepts the truth, and lives. The constable refuses, and dies. Locke is the anti-feminazi. She saves her mans life, and immediately wants to go back to being a real woman, in his arms.This movie deserves a ten, because the action scenes are just there so people can handle all of the raw truth in the movie.

There is no plot as such, rather the film takes the form of a human survival story about three people trapped up a tree with a man eating crocodile lurking somewhere in the water beneath them.Personally, I thought the acting was mostly very good, despite the roles being quite demanding at times, and I felt a sense of warmth for the characters. The situation they were in was quite terrifying and I really felt nervous for them. I found the whole film quite nerve wracking because of the sheer helplessness of their situation and the constant threat to their survival.The crocodile effects were handled surprisingly well for such a low budget film, and believe me, I have seen my fair share of dodgy croc movies. The creature moved well and had real menace and, although the audience I was with didn't seem too keen on the film as a whole, they still jumped and gasped whenever the crocodile appeared.Script-wise, I would have made a few changes, particularly towards the end, but this was not a major problem.

I just thought that a society devoted to the telling of ghost stories was a great idea. Anyway, while the plot does wander around a bit and it takes time to get to the point, it still works great. It was nice to see that Fred Astaire could still act (because he was such a great dancer we forget that he had a great comic talent and, in this case, a dramatic talent). The others are equally formidable. There are also some pretty slimy, putrid visions that appear and make for a pretty good rank on the jump scale. The actually scene that explains everything (I won't spoil it) is both sad and revealing. While not the greatest movie, it works very well and I would recommend it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjkyODk0MmQtODEzZC00NTU5LTgyMTktZmFlZGM1ZTQ2ZTNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I, on the other hand, feel that the film profits greatly from expert cinematography, fluent storytelling and convincing(albeit rather undemanding)acting. Pitting Gibson (the now-retired drug dealer lured back for one last deal) and Russell (the reluctant sheriff assigned to bust him) as best of friends on opposite sides of the law was a strong premise, made even more compelling by the fact that the drug dealer (Gibson) is the sympathetic character and the cop (Russell) is the sly, manipulative sort. There is an apparent sense of irony and it goes a long way to making an otherwise average story, interesting and very watchable. Pfeiffer is the glamorous love interest whose character does a lot to intensify the rivalry between the two men. Much of the drama and strength however comes from the late J.T Walsh as Russell's superior, hell bent on bringing Gibson down and his Mexican drug counter-part who nobody has ever seen. A special sense of irony presents itself at the denouement for Walsh unknowlingly becomes a pawn in the drug ring that has now become the talk of the town thanks to his vendetta.The also late Raul Julia never disappoints as the charismatic yet enigmatic Mexican law enforcer. Julia and Walsh complement the film beautifully as side characters with dubious intentions. They are multi-faceted and like all the other people in this film are torn between what they should do and what they want to do, and in fact what they end up doing. Nothing is black and white in Tequila Sunrise; it's a very grey area. With every development we learn more about the people and how they are so far from being what we originally perceived. Hats off to to Robert Towne for his writing. Tequila Sunrise may lack the inventiveness, vision, and dynamism of Chinatown (Robert Towne wrote both scripts), but it should, by no means be discarded as a mediocre cop thriller.It is a very slick piece of cinema with fine acting, glamorous sets, and great dialogue. Furthermore, unlike some of it's predecessors it's a film that can be seen repeatedly without losing it's cutting edge. Under appreciated and underrated, Tequila Sunrise is an excellent film","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEyYWRkNGItNjFmZS00NTRjLTlmMGQtN2ZhM2ViNjNiODAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The screening was held at the ""Icon"" festival (sort of the Israeli version of comic-con) in Tel-Aviv, Israel. The screening began at midnight on the night of Sep. 24-25 2013. The movie was introduced by one of the producers. She got on stage, said a few words about the film and then dropped the bomb on all of us - This was the world premiere! The theater ERUPTED! Clapping and hooting for a good 2 minutes before she could keep on talking.What can I say? It was a theater packed with geeks and everyone went wild! the film is fantastic! The cast is brilliant and I laughed out loud at least 20 times (Even though on this page it doesn't say that the movie is actually a comedy - it totally is!). People were even clapping and cheering at many key moments. The feeling in the room was electric. We don't know which cut we got to see though, but it didn't feel too long - just right, in fact. Peter Dinklage is wonderful as usual and Summer Glau's performance - she was was fantastic. She is every geek's wet dream of course.. But she really delivered the whole ""I'm not really into this but I'm playing along with it"" role. She looked amazing in her costume! Her on screen chemistry with the other characters was excellent. She is definitely one of the underrated actresses out there.The film itself has some great plot twists and even though it had a very low budget - it manages to escape the feel of a B-movie. It even had some pretty good CGI animation. At the end everyone was clapping and as I walked out of the theater, feeling giddy - EVERYONE was smiling, laughing, reminiscing and all in all I didn't hear a single person saying anything negative about it. The only reason this film gets a 9 is because a 10 is reserved for maybe 5- 10 movies in my life. If you are a geek, were a geek, or simply have a little bit of geekyness in you - don't hesitate when it is released - it's worth every penny! Go with friends who appreciate this kind of stuff.

This seems like a fairly radical claim that I doubt they could really defend even though my knowledge of Hindi cinema is still far from complete. DIL SE seemed like a pretty honest examination of the subject to me, and that was several years earlier. I don't want to hold the claims on the DVD case against the movie though, as SARFAROSH is certainly an interesting take on the subject.Ajay Singh's brother is killed and his father brain damaged by terrorists when Ajay is a small boy, because his father was going to stand up against them in court or something. Ajay takes this to heart (as you would), and as a young adult he devotes himself to becoming a police inspector and fighting against crime, and terrorists in particular. The movie is essentially about one case, where Ajay has to get to the roots of an operation smuggling guns into the country. The operation is backed by a Pakistani general, with the rationale that arming criminals in India is a cheap but effective way of waging war. The movie does push a fairly unbalanced ""Pakistan aggressors, India = victims"" message, though it is very careful/keen not to equate this with Muslim vs Hindu and turn it into a religious issue. The movie is fairly serious throughout - although there is a romantic interest (the lovely Sonali Bendre), it's not overplayed and does serve a useful function by building the character of Ajay and putting the case in the context of his life. For the most part though, the movie is focussed on the investigation and the encounters between the police and the criminals as they trace the criminal network closer to its roots. It's quite an action packed movie, and features some of the best action scenes I've seen in an Indian movie. No bullet ballet or kung fu, but quite realistic fights and shootouts that are never-the-less very well choreographed and filmed. The movie bears an 18 rating, because the action does get quite violent. A lot of people die in the course of the movie, and a few of them in quite gruesome ways. One thing I've noticed in quite a lot of Asian movies is that police violence is treated quite sympathetically - even as quite noble. The cops in Sarfarosh don't mess around - if threatening, beating or framing a criminal is the best way to get a result then they don't hesitate to do so. If a criminal happens to get killed in the course of an operation then they don't seem terribly upset either, unless it was somebody they wanted to interrogate .Ajay Singh is played by Aamir Khan, an actor I haven't come across before. He's not a pretty boy by any means, but he does a very good job with the character. It's a good character too - well developed and believable, honorable without being sanctimonius. The rest of the cast all do a good job too, although Sonali Bendre doesn't have a lot to do except look pretty and dance around in the musical numbers.The script for the movie is very tight, with both the criminals and the cops operations and motivations seeming quite convincing. The movie does veer a little towards preaching in places, especially towards the end, but this is forgivable. The direction is very confident and focussed, and sound and cinematography throughout are good throughout.All round, a good movie worth seeking out.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQwMWE0ZDItOTBjOC00MzJhLWIwNWYtYzU4ODJkMjA3MTI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcyNDY1NDgw._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Being from Hawaii and now living in the mainland it was fun to watch this movie... yes it's very much like goonies but the infusion of the Hawaii culture, language and folk lore made it all the more special. The night marchers story was very similar to what we were taught growing up as was the pidgin and infusion of Hawaiian words. Loved that their home was authentic with glass jalousie windows and tons of wood paneling. The filming of most of the film appears to be in Hawaii and they even have Halona beach from "" from here to eternity"" in it. The cast looks like the majority of them are from Hawaii which is refreshing considering the majority of the tv shows filmed in Hawaii have lead characters who are not from Hawaii and butcher the Hawaiian Pidgin and culture. The family relationship is realistic and my kids could identify with the siblings. It was.clean and light hearted.

His partner is the rookie Bobby Keough (Scott Speedman), the nephew of the Chief of the Department Jack Van Meter (Breendan Gleeson), one of the best friends of Eldon's father. Eldon follows his orders without questioning, being protected by his superior, when interrogated by the Internal Affairs. Jack and Eldon do not have ethics, using intimidation, corruption and blackmail to achieve their targets and defeat their enemies. However, Assistant Chief Holland (Ving Rhames) is a honest officer, who fights against the corruption in the department and wants to destroy Jack and Elson. Bobby does not fit well in such a corrupted environment and is in love with Sargent Beth Williamson (Michael Michele), who works with Holland and had a love affair with him five years before. When four persons are executed in a Corean store by two criminals protected by Jack, Eldon and Bobby are in charge to find two scapegoats to take the blame. Meanwhile, tension is increasing on the streets of Los Angeles due to the trial of four white officers, who spanked the black motorist Rodney King. Having the backdrop of the real case of Rodney King, and consequent violence on the streets of LA after the absolving of the four white officers responsible for his aggression, and many plot points, ""Dark Blue"" is a very different, realistic and dramatic police story. Themes like racism, police excessive (or brutal) use of force for intimidation, corruption, blackmail, violent crimes, redemption etc. are presented in this film. The corruption in all levels of the police department and the justice system is explored in this movie. Although being in Los Angeles, it could be in most of the police departments of different nations. The performance of Kurt Russell is once again amazing, in the role of a man who goes to hell, destroying his personal and professional life in all the aspects, and looking for redemption in the end.

Yes, they are entertaining, usually with great actors and fine performances - thinking man's thrillers. But generally they remain nothing more than that - a well-done conversation piece. ""A Civil Action"" was a pleasant surprise because it is not only like neither of those films, but also because it is a good film starring John Travolta. While he had his moments in the spotlight for good reason (think: ""Pulp Fiction"") his movies are generally not that great. But that's just a personal opinion and I may be wrong.Still, ""A Civil Action"" is a great courtroom film. For one, it's a true story (which doesn't necessarily say much), and it is told with restraint, quietness and respect for the characters involved (which should be saying a lot). It takes the best from ""Silkwood"" and ""Verdict"" and it gives us people who are real and who engage in battle the way we imagine real people would. They don't have dramatic moments in the courtroom upon which an unreal stillness descends so as to be shattered at the end of the speech by the thunderous sound of unanimous, emotionally-fraught clapping.John Travolta is great here and so is the rest of the cast, among them William H. Macy, Kathleen Quinlan, Sydney Pollack, John Lithgow, Stephen Fry (in a small cameo role), Kathy Bates (in an even smaller cameo role) and the great Robert Duvall. In the end, it is Duvall who steals the show in his quiet, unemotional musings, advice-givings and deliberations with Travolta. He embodies the restraint for which the film strives. ""A Civil Action"" is quiet in its proceedings and, consequently real. It tells the story of a lawyer who reluctantly accepts a case having to do with the contamination of water and the deaths of many children in a small town and becomes obsessed with it to the point of going bankrupt. His obsession mirrors the self-destructiveness of Paul Newman's lawyer in ""Verdict,"" and it has real results. His adversaries are not evil people, per se (think Jack Nicholson in ""A Few Good Men""), but people who are simply doing their jobs damn well, defending their interests. We shouldn't expect them to cave in to pretty speech-making, nor should the jury.And watching ""A Civil Action"" we don't and it doesn't. The personalities clash, personal tragedy is pitted against financial burdens of the legal process, and it yields startling conclusions about the American Justice system. And that is what ""A Civil Action"" chooses to focus on more so than the true story it tells (though it doesn't ignore it either). The film shows the price of justice and how justice is understood in the legal process. In fact, it draws a very fine dichotomy between non-legal justice and legal justice and shows how hard it is to get ""justice"" in a legal setting. Needless to say, it becomes a very expensive ordeal full of re-interpretations of the law and annoying manipulations of it. What we can gather from the story, however, is that we should be grateful for people who are willing to go to extreme lengths, at great personal cost, to define justice on their own terms and to fight for it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmEzNjhiZWEtNTM5OS00ZmQyLThhYjEtNjY4ZDZhOGFkMzI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

That was a very pleasant hour and a half.I like to be told a story, and that's what the movie does. This story is completely centred around its characters, the young couple next door, portrayed with simplicity and in a way that lets us relate and empathise. They also act and react like sane and sensible people, which is so uncommon nowadays that it's worth mentioning.I'll sum it up as both intriguing and amusing, a double source of entertainment. One way to achieve that is to confuse the viewer as much as the protagonists. A very right thing to do, and done in the right proportion in my opinion. We can get confused for a minute, yet we always understand what's happening. There is also a constant undertone of drama.

Most of the original Creep generated its atmosphere from the audience's lack of knowledge about the main character and what his actual motivations were. This time we are aware of who he is and what he is about, so while eager to see what happens this time it would be hard to pull off the same magic with a completely similar plot. Luckily the creators knew this and made enough changes to the dynamic, while still basically keeping it in line with the expectations set by the first, to give a fresh feel to the set up. While they kept in most of the unease that made the first Creep great, they also actually delved more into the main character and his backstory, if he is ever to be believed. This possibly more intimate view of the main takes away a small amount of the tension since he has to become more vulnerable and likable, but it is done in such a way where it is still enjoyable and gripping, and events unfold without too much of an obvious conclusion. Overall it is a worthy sequel, if in my opinion not as good as the original, and is well worth a watch.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2MTkxMDYzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTc3Mzc4MzI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I've read about him before, and from memory, he was an exceptional martial artist (he practiced Hung-Gar) and became a folk-hero to the people of China, much like his father, Wong Kei Ying. So there is the true story, and then there is the 200 or so movies made about him. 'Drunken Master' is one of these.I haven't seen most of those 200 movies, except for the Drunken Master movies, Jet Li's 'Once Upon a Time in China' series, and 'Iron Monkey'. The 'Once Upon a Time in China' movies and 'Iron Monkey' may be somewhat over-the-top wu xia movies, but they portray Wong Fei Hung as a serious hero. 'Drunken Master' features a very different take on the character.Jackie Chan's Wong Fei Hung is a rebellious trouble-maker. His father, Wong Kei Ying, has given up on disciplining him, and sends him to his uncle, So Hai, the master of drunken boxing, hoping that a year of training with So Hai will sort Fei Hung out. Fei doesn't seem to learn his lesson until a chance encounter with Thunderfoot (Hwang Jang Lee)...Story-wise, it is a bit of a standard kung-fu plot. However, in a documentary on Jackie Chan (I can't remember the name, I know that as of this review, it isn't listed on IMDb, but it was shown on SBS in 2003), 'Drunken Master' was mentioned as his breakthrough hit that nearly killed his career: Apparently Chinese viewers were insulted by Jackie's portrayal of Wong Fei Hung and nearly boycotted him when he was just gaining fame as an actor.Onto more important matters. Like kung-fu. 'Drunken Master' is one of the kung-fu classics. Boosted by the presence of martial-arts star Hwang Jang Lee, this pretty much made or solidified the careers of Jackie Chan and Yuen Woo Ping (in his directorial debut). 'Drunken Master' features some very well choreographed fights and training scenes. 'Drunken Master' is very funny too, and is one of two movies I know where a young main-character gets beaten by an older middle-aged lady (which is always funny, more movies need a scene like this) - the other movie is Battlefield Baseball.As a matter of interest for Jackie Chan fans: 'Drunken Master' signaled the end of Jackie Chan's work with director Wei Lo. Yay. In fact, the Columbia Tristar DVD release of 'Drunken Master' includes audio commentary by experts on Hong Kong cinema. I will check that out sometime, but it sounds like it would appeal to fans of kung-fu movies. Some more trivia - the latest release doesn't have the complete Cantonese sound track, and so the English dub is used where the Cantonese track is incomplete.'Drunken Master' features awesome kung-fu scenes, and has some interesting historical perspectives. Ah, kung-fu movies and history, some of my favourite hobbies together at last - 10/10, a must see for any fans of Jackie Chan or kung-fu movies, 'Drunken Master' is kung-fu perfection.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY1ZjM2MzgtODUwZi00NWM3LThlYjAtNWJjZGM2ZDY1ODg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQyMTMwOTk0._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The film makers simply missed the mark on this and did a very poor job of turning this murder case into a story line for a film.As a movie, it felt extremely disjointed. They flicked between different time points very quickly, which made it difficult to grasp how much time had actually passed between events. There is very little character development so viewers are left without any idea of who most of the people actually are, which is especially sad given that there are real people behind every character. In terms of the case details, they had some very odd choices in what to include and what to leave out, and they dramatized certain things but down played others. I feel they misrepresented certain people and certain relationships, and didn't seem to present much of a story. Overall it was just a terrible movie.

"Moonwalker","1971.0","","93.0","Action, Crime, Fantasy","6.1","","Jerry Kramer","Jim Blashfield, Colin Chilvers, Michael Jackson, Joe Pesci, Sean Lennon, Kelley Parker","18,264","Anthology movie by, and starring,Michael Jacksonin his prime, combining a number of music videos from his bestselling ""Bad"" album with a fantasy tale of Michael's confrontation with a ruthless drug dealer known as Mr. Big.","80","Self-indulgence as only Michael Jackson knows how","In 1988, Michael Jackson was literally on top of the world. His 1987 album Bad had set a record for the most number one singles to come from the same album. Add to that the fact that his previous albums had all set records for sales, to the extent that not even an organisation as powerful as the RIAA could withhold his rightful share of the money. To cut a long story short, Jackson was the King of the musical world, and even to an old cynic like myself who was raised on Black Sabbath, it did not seem undeserving. So when Michael Jackson asked for more than twenty million dollars to make a series of fantasy viginettes based around his songs that basically portray him as the saviour of the world, the last thing the combined powers of the MPAA and RIAA were willing to say was ""no"". But then the 1990s hit, and Michael Jackson's reputation in the world's consciousness changed from that of an eccentric billionaire to a worn out circus freak. Let that be a lesson to all budding musicians - if it can happen to Michael Jackson, it can literally happen to anybody.It appears that Warner Brothers now own the rights to this rather odd piece, so it has finally seen the light of day on DVD-Video. This time capsule of the late 1980s is as odd now as most of the rest of the Michael Jackson material that came after. As you can expect from a film that mostly consists of viginettes put together to the specifications of an eccentric millionaire, unifying themes are hard to come by. The first thirty-five or so minutes of the film is a quick recap of Jackson's career up to that point, followed by what is essentially an extended pair of music videos that satirise the cannibalistic fascination the press had with Jackson in the 1980s. It is after this thirty-five minutes that the material finds a real focus, and in spite of the high bar set by the earlier material, it manages to get even stranger than before.The plot of Moonwalker proper concerns itself with a non-specific future world where we follow three children living in a dirty world of squalor. As a hit squad makes an attempt on the life of Jackson, who is playing himself, we get a flashback to happier times that ends in a weird explanation of why the world we see is now so dirty. Joe Pesci portrays an embodiment of evil by the name of Frankie Lideo, whose ambition is to have every child in the world taking drugs. Given that Ritalin and such torture pills were still popular at the time, Jackson's vanity project takes on a scary level of accuracy I doubt he intended. Of course, the whole thing is just a transparent Just Say No message that gained Jackson a few points with the Reagan administration at the time, and doubtlessly got the nod from Bush senior, too. Not least because of Joe Pesci's immortally embarrassing line about how his troops have to stop ""them"" praying in school. I do not know whether Jackson or co-writer David Newman came up with this crock, but it is a good thing Jackson ran out of favours with the Republican party during the 1990s. Otherwise, who knows what kind of propaganda we would have to tolerate today?To be fair, the new footage of the film is skilfully edited, shot, and choreographed. Being one of the few films shot with a 1.33:1 aspect ratio in mind, it is surprising how dynamic some of the shots are. Joe Pesci chews the scenery like he was previously on a hunger strike, while Paul Reubens gets a cameo as a voice and claymation puppet that will amuse the adults in the audience. The cinematography of the main event is actually quite tight. The special effects more than justify the budget. At the time, the twenty-two million dollars used to make the film was consider extravagant, even by Michael Jackson's standards. The claymation is far from seamless, and some of the effects are dated, but considering the advances in film-making technology since, it does not look too shabby at all. Had Michael Jackson intended to make a coherent musical rather than a loose framework for music videos, there is no telling what might have resulted.While RIAA-endorsed music has only got worse since Michael Jackson's fall from the limelight, it is somehow considered cool or hip to rag on the man and his music. I do not know the truth of all the allegations made about Jackson. I really think they are best left to those making them, and the man himself. So when I see the film depicting him playing catch in a park with a small group of children, I do not get the sense of alarm bells so many others describe. The video game based on this film is a whole other story, but video games were considerably cruder in those days. The is a reason why Bad yielded no less than six number one singles (from a track list of eleven, no less). Jackson was at his creative apex, both writing songs and conceiving music videos that neither he nor anyone else endorsed by the RIAA have matched since. The next time you hear someone try to tell you that creativity was dead in the 1980s, this, along with some videos from the likes of Devo, will set them straight.When all is said and done, I gave Moonwalker a five out of ten. It is as self-indulgent as you would expect from a man who could afford to light his cigarettes with hundred dollar bills. Much of it is unnecessary, even crap, but when it falls back upon its strengths, namely the music, it shines. This is the kind of time capsule that the culture of the 1980s really deserves.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM4ZDcxM2QtMTEyNC00OWJhLTkyMjUtYzg4MzRhMTBiNzE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjY3MjUzNDk@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Wow.A film that took 5 years to make and co-ordinate. Shot in Panarama 70mm, across 26 countries, needing major government and regulatory clearances, having to wait for certain seasons or lunar phases to get the light to hit the way director Fricke wanted...carefully strung together with a massive 7.1 surround sound design and music score from Michael Stearns, Marcello de Francisci, and Lisa Gerrard (of Dead Can Dance).The 70mm negative has been digitally scanned and oversampled at 8k resolution (much like the 'Baraka' Blu-ray); the TIFF Lightbox theatre installed a brand new Christie 4k projector (Christie Projection Systems rushed the projector before its release to the market specifically for this event) making it the first true 4k screening of it's kind. From sweeping landscapes to time-lapse sequences of the night sky and from exclusive looks into the processing of food to the consumption and effects it has on the human body, Samsara is nothing short of astounding. Modern technology, production lines, and human robotics are juxtaposed against a backdrop of deserts, garbage mounds as far as the eye can see, and traffic congestion in modern centres. The time-lapse footage is simply transcendent. In fact, I caught myself questioning the reality of some of the landscape vistas and night skyline montages...they looked so hyper-real that I thought they must have come from a CG lab somewhere. Simply astonishing. The richness, depth and clarity of colour and image achieved within the processes utilized gives birth to the most beautiful visual meditation that I have ever witnessed.As one film journalist noted, ""That Samsara is instantly one of the most visually-stunning films in the history of cinema is reason enough to cherish it, but Fricke and co-editor Mark Magidson achieve truly profound juxtapositions, brimming with meaning and emotion. It sounds preposterous, but it's true: In 99 minutes, Samsara achieves something approaching a comprehensive portrait of the totality of human experience. If you're even remotely fond of being alive, Samsara is not to be missed.""If you ever come across the chance to see this film in a decent theatre, run, and let your eyeballs (and earholes) feast upon its brilliance.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjY3NzM4MTI5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk3NTA5Nw@@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Is this movie Oscar material?  Certainly not, but it's a great film in many ways.First of all, Bill Conti offers up a first rate uplifting musical score. It's outstanding work and you hear a bit of resemblence to the score he wrote for a 1982 film that received a little bit of notoriety -- The Right Stuff.Next, the cinematography is simply gorgeous.  Soccer is not an easy sport to film and I think this film was done wonderfully.  I thought the choice of film stock, a certain amount of grain to make it almost like you're watching a documentary was a nice touch.  Some of the action shots and slow-mos are absolutely wonderful to behold.Finally, we have a nice plot with a couple of surprises, a great cast, and an auteur director.  Certainly, Huston was in failing health and not at the top of his game by this time but his work on this film was still memorable. For me I will always remember the wonderful line with ""The Forger"" asking Hatch ""You don't want to get shot as a spy do you?""  And the quick reply, ""No, I don't want to get shot as anything.""  Simple one liner, uncomplicated, yet funny.Victory is a great inspirational film, a sure hit for soccer fans (of course he wasn't offside - he was behind the ball when it was struck!) and a nice film for war buffs.

There are very few movies I won't sit through. No amount of shock or horror or immorality or amorality or even cheesiness will deter me. Practically the only thing that will is poor film making. The type that is lazy and bland. Mostly I manage to avoid these type of thing by never watching films with Vince Vaughan but once in a while you let your guard down. I could claim it was Billy Bob but it was probably Winona. What can i say? I am weak.This film has nothing to offer and nothing to say. The bass monotone of the soundtrack that washes over the disparate and poorly written open 15-20 minutes tries to imply a threatening atmosphere of doom or something but you cannot imply meaning without there being meaning. There was more to the eighties than bad hair and depeche mode. We already know that blonde people are shallow and sex without love is a meaningless experience (""but as meaningless experiences go its one of....."").Films are difficult to make. But there are a few simple rules that will help. Establish character and motivation. Give the audience something to care about or at least intrigue them with something unfamiliar and new. Don't pretend you have said something when you haven't yet. Try to earn the respect of the audience with good dialogue. Multi-layered narratives can work but weak trivial garbage on top of trivial garbage is still ... well you can work it out.Of course i might be wrong. Some people seemed to like it.

You couldn't have a movie that was 2 hours of nothing but band performances so you HAD to wrap a formulaic story around it. ""Boy meets girl/boy loses girl/boy gets girl back and learns the value of teamwork in time for the big showdown"" is a formula that has worked for years -- and it works here!Another poster remarked that the band camp scenes were unrealistic because they were too ""militaristic"" ... he didn't believe that (among other things) that the students would be made to run around holding their drums and so forth. Well, believe it!I marched in one of these bands (Southern University in Louisiana) 20 years ago and back then, band camp was FAR MORE INTENSE than anything you see on the screen in this movie. YES, it is that competitive. YES, it is that grueling. YES, it is that disciplined. Black College marching band is serious business and this film gives you only a small sample of what it takes to ""make the band.""The actual band performances are AWESOME and will definitely be an eye-opener to anyone who has never seen this type of thing before. More importantly, there is no sex, violence, drug use, and very little bad language (just the requisite ""d*mns"" and ""h@lls"" - nothing any more intense than prime-time television.) Equally important, the movie features strong male figures who resolve differences without resorting to pathological violence.One last point -- the movie grossed 13+ million dollars in its opening weekend. And this was against Star Trek (18.7 M) and the Jennifer Lopez (19 M) movie. Although it finished in third place, it was shown in about 1,000 fewer theaters than those two.

I shall not comment on the greatness of the film's technical achievements; the stunning cinematography, the production design, the brilliance of the screenplay based on actual transcripts from the trial, or the perfection of Mr. Dreyer's direction. The performance of Falconetti as Jeanne d' Arc has a profundity and depth far beyond my ability to illuminate. I suppose the best I can hope to do is to share my feelings, however inadequately expressed, of the effect it had on me. To say that it may be the greatest film ever made is to sound both obvious and trite. That a work of such beauty and simplicity, made seventy-six years ago can still have the power to move audiences in an era of multi-million dollar, hi-tech, bombastic over-wrought cinematic drivel is in itself a testament to the vision and genius of Carl Theodor Dreyer, Maria Falconetti and their collaborators. It is nourishment for those that hunger for something more in cinema, a feast for the soul. It is a reminder that film can indeed be art, and this film like all great works of art, lifts and transports us from the routine of our work-a-day lives to enable us, if only for a moment to experience the sublime. When viewing it we look at it as looking in a mirror. That is to say we look into ourselves. We question ourselves as to our own beliefs, or the lack thereof and the strength of spirit that enables an individual to endure the unendurable. Viewing it is a profound experience the nature of which for myself is transcendent rather than religious, because I am not in the least a religious person.

It looks like the young man is going out way beyond being a Walt Disney bubblegum poster boy for pubescent young ladies. When we first meet Efron in the title role he looks to be a young man with a bright future. A scholarship to Stanford is his as he graduates high school from his New England coastal town where he enjoys sailing and the companionship of his younger brother Charles Tatan. The two are rabid Red Sox fans as all New England kids are brought up to be. Efron's boat is named the Splendid Splinter which everyone in New England knows is the nickname of Ted Williams. Being much older than Zac or his character, I actually remember seeing Ted play.A cruel trick of fate puts the two of them in the path of an oncoming drunk driver. Both die, but a determined paramedic played by Ray Liotta brings Efron back.As per an agreement they made minutes before the crash, Efron and Tatan still meet in the woods every day to play catch and work on Tatan's baseball skills. It's all Efron lives for. By some trick of fate he can communicate and see Tatan, in fact he sees all kinds of dead folks including a young man he graduated with from high school who was killed in Iraq. Efron's forgotten Stanford and he now works at the local graveyard, the better to be near the ones he identifies with. I won't go into the rest except that Efron does learn to let the dead bury the dead. Meeting up with Amanda Crew, another sailing enthusiast does help. And Liotta now dying of cancer tells Zac that he was saved for some special purpose.Two great lessons of life are to be learned in Charlie St. Cloud. First that we all have some kind of destiny, the trick is to find it and recognize it. The second is that some people die young and maybe are meant to so that the rest of us recognize how precious life is and not to waste it. Having lost any number of people including a sister at a young age, it's something that is always uppermost in my mind.Charlie St. Cloud is beautifully filmed with some breathtaking sailing sequences. The performers are flawless, especially Zac Efron. One thing I will agree with other reviewers about is that I wish that the role of the mother of the St. Cloud brothers played by Kim Basinger was more fully developed. After the death of her younger son, she moves out of town and you never really learn why.Despite that minor criticism, Charlie St. Cloud is a moving film that should be seen by all generations for the life lessons imparted.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFkNTUxOTMtMGNjNC00NTUyLWI1NjctMGI0MGM1ZjY1MzY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI1Mzg0ODA5._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

And this is before raising the events that developed her into the women she was - all that is provided here is a few flashbacks to her father speaking in public. There is no real mention of her fight for the leadership, nothing on her career before politics, and very little about her developmental years (university etc).In summary it just seems this film was out to try and get in the running for as many Oscars as it could and they didn't care if they screwed any one over to get there. Not only is Margaret Thatchers retirement private but her declining health should not be used as an opportunity for someone to get in the running for an Oscar.

It's always a risk serving up a visual absolute of a universal concept, but it works surprisingly well here because Haggard knows just how much to show.

Incredibly, however, this film would seem to be the first-ever English-language version made for the cinema rather than television. There were a number of versions made in Britain or America during the early days of the cinema, but these were all silents.The reason for this neglect of the play may be connected with sensitivities about the play's alleged anti-Semitism, a subject which has been even more sensitive since the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933. (This may explain why all previous versions were made during the silent era; in 1908 or 1922 it would have been easier to portray Shylock as a straightforward villain than it would be today). Yet in my view the film is not anti-Semitic at all. It should be remembered that during Shakespeare's lifetime there was no settled Jewish community in England; the Jews had been expelled by Edward I in the late 13th century, and were not permitted to return until the time of Cromwell, some forty years after Shakespeare's death. As far as we know, Shakespeare never travelled abroad, so it seems quite possible that he himself never knew any Jews personally or experienced the effects of anti-Semitism at first hand. The play is not simply about the Jewish question, but is, among other things, an analysis of the corrosive effects of religious prejudice. It may, in fact, be a coded examination of the mutual antipathy between Catholics and Protestants in Tudor England (something of which Shakespeare certainly would have had first-hand experience) and an appeal for greater tolerance between them.Then as now, traditional anti-Semitic stereotypes had always depicted Jews as avaricious, but Shylock's principal sin is not avarice; if it were, he would certainly have accepted Bassanio's offer to pay him six thousand ducats, twice the amount borrowed by Antonio. Rather, Shylock's besetting sin is anger, and the root of his anger is the way in which he and his fellow-Jews are treated by the Christians of Venice. Not only are Jews in general regarded as second-class citizens, but Jewish moneylenders such as Shylock are particular targets for abuse, even though the services they provide are necessary to the Venetian economy. The play shows the corrupting effects of prejudice. Not only do views of this sort corrupt the Christians who hold them, they can also corrupt the Jews who suffer abuse. Shylock's vindictiveness is out of all proportion to the wrongs he has suffered. By spitting on him and calling him a dog, Antonio behaves like a boorish bigot, but boorishness and bigotry are not generally regarded as crimes deserving of the death penalty. Moreover, Shylock seeks to revenge himself on Antonio not merely for the undoubted wrongs that Antonio has done towards him, but also for all the wrongs, real and imaginary, that he has suffered at the hands of the Christian community, such as his daughter's marriage to Lorenzo. It is to the credit of the film's director, Michael Radford and of its star, Al Pacino, that they understand all these issues. Pacino's Shylock has, initially, a sort of angry dignity about him that gradually gives way to vindictive rage and finally, after his humiliation in the trial scene by Portia's reasoning, to pathos. We see clearly that he has been the instrument of his own destruction, but we can still sympathise with him. In my view, none of Pacino's performances that I have seen have ever equalled those he gave in the first two 'Godfather' films (not 'Scent of a Woman', for which he won an Oscar, and certainly not 'Godfather III'), but 'The Merchant of Venice is the one that comes closest to those benchmarks. The other acting performance that stood out was Lynn Collins's luminous Portia, speaking her lines with great clarity and simplicity and bringing out the intelligence and resourcefulness that make her character more than simply a romantic heroine. I was less impressed with Jeremy Irons's Antonio, who seemed too passive. Antonio is a complex character; part loyal friend, part melancholy contemplative, part religious bigot and part enterprising capitalist. Although Irons captured the first two of those aspects, it was difficult to envisage his Antonio either spitting on someone of a different faith or hazarding his all on risky trading ventures. Radford's interpretation of the play was attacked by the film critic of the 'Daily Telegraph' who, although he admired Pacino's performance, disliked the period setting and argued that Shakespeare needs to be placed in a contemporary setting if it is to have 'relevance' for a modern audience, citing a recent stage production which set the action in Weimar Germany. I would disagree profoundly with this approach. The theatre and the cinema are quite different media and, while there have been some striking modernist approaches to Shakespeare in the cinema (Trevor Nunn's 'Twelfth Night' comes to mind), a traditionalist approach is often the best one. (I preferred, for example, Zeffirelli's 'Romeo and Juliet' to Baz Luhrmann's). The idea that we can only appreciate Shakespeare in a modern guise is sheer intellectual laziness; we are not prepared to make the effort to see our greatest writer in the context of the Elizabethan society that produced him, but rather prefer him dressed up as an ersatz twentieth-century man.Radford's traditional approach not only enables us to appreciate that bigotry and vindictiveness are age-old, universal problems, but also makes for a visually striking film. In the play, the scenes set in Venice itself are characterised by turbulent action; those set in Portia's country house at Belmont are happier and more peaceful. In the film, the Venetian exterior scenes were shot on location against a backdrop of misty, wintry grey skies, similar to the look achieved in 'Don't Look Now'. The candlelit interiors, with faces brightly lit against a dark background, were reminiscent of the chiaroscuro effects of a Caravaggio painting; I suspect this was quite deliberate, as Caravaggio was a contemporary of Shakespeare. By contrast to dark or misty Venice, the Belmont scenes (shot in an enchanting Palladian villa on an island in a lake) were characterised by sunshine or peaceful moonlight. This is one of the best Shakespeare adaptations of recent years; an intelligent and visually attractive look at a complex play. 8/10.A couple of errors. We see a black swan on the water in front of Portia's house. These birds are natives of Australia and were not introduced to Europe until well after 1596, the date when the film is set. Also, the portrait of Portia in the leaden casket is painted in the style of the Florentine Botticelli, who was active about a century before that date. Lynn Collins may be reminiscent of a Botticelli beauty, but it seems unlikely that a late 16th century Venetian lady would have had herself painted in the manner of late 15th century Florence.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGJiNGUxZGYtM2U2YS00ZjJlLThlNjQtYTVkNWUxZGRmYTk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

After learning he's hiding a sum of cash around, the women start scheming on him.","86","The ""Citizen Kane"" of trash cinema","Three go-go dancers - Varla (Tura Satana), Rosie (Haji) and Billie (Lori Williams) - are racing their sports cars out in the desert when they meet up with a young man named Tommy (Ray Barlow) and his girlfriend Linda (Susan Bernard). Tommy is an amateur car racer who has come out to do some time trials. Varla challenges him to a race. When she cuts him off with her car it leads to a fight and she kills him. Dragging the frightened Linda with them the trio go into the nearest town to fill up with petrol. There they see a muscly young man (Dennis Busch) carrying his crippled father (Stuart Lancaster) to his truck. The petrol station attendant (Mickey Foxx) tells the girls that the muscle man is retarded and that his bitter old father is reputed to be rich, but must have his riches stashed away somewhere at his isolated homestead. The girls decide to drop in for a visit hoping to find the old man's riches. They pass off Linda as a rich man's runaway daughter they are bringing home against her will. What they don't know is that the old man is a misogynist who delights in kidnapping women for his son, whom he refers to only as The Vegetable, to rape. They will have to rely on their own deadly talents and the possible decency of the old man's other son Kirk (Paul Trinka).Russ Meyer's black and white ""ode to the violence in women"" made little impact when first released in 1965. Meyer had taken the world by storm with ""The Immoral Mr. Teas"" (1959), the film most often credited with kicking off the nudie cutie craze. And he would become a household name with the success of ""Vixen!"" (1968). But the films he made between those two landmarks, though some of them are among his best work, didn't attract much attention. But then John Waters, in his 1981 autobiography ""Shock Value"" wrote : ""'Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!'...is, beyond a doubt, the best movie ever made. It is possibly better than any film that will be made in the future."" Waters dubbed Meyer ""the Eisentein of sex films"" because his use of skillful editing to get maximum impact out of scenes of sex and violence is reminiscent of the methods by which the Russian director managed to powerfully convey his political messages. Waters' championing of ""Faster, Pussycat!"", in particular, led to it becoming a favourite on college campus's across America.If Meyer is ""the Eisenstein of sex films"" then ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" is the ""Citizen Kane"" of trash films. I don't use the term disparagingly. For me a trash film is a film which appeals on a visceral rather than purely emotional level. In trash films realism is bad style. We must always know that we are watching a movie and enjoy it as a fantasy formed from our own base drives - from those uncivilised aspects of our nature that we must repress to live a civilised existence. Hence the term ""trash"" for the substance of these films is those aspects of ourselves which must be discarded. The violence in the trash film appeals to the knot in our stomach from every time we've had to bite back on our anger. It's prurient sexuality appeals to the lusts generated by everyday existence for which we may have insufficient outlet. We don't sympathise with the characters in a film like this, but we can identify with their actions because they take place in an obvious fantasy world. But the trash film has another appeal - the exhilaration that comes from the transgression of the bounds of good taste. And its sense of humour is the kind which elicits a belly-laugh. The anarchic spirit of the trash film has no less value than the more rarefied pleasures and intellectual stimulation of the art film.What makes ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" great is the way that it takes the sex and violence of the trash film and distills them into something more iconic than explicit. Unlike most of Meyer's films, there is no frontal nudity or sex scenes. The violence is powerful, but not extended or shown in gory detail. Yet Tura Satana in her tight black jeans, half-exposed breasts practically bursting free as she eyes up a man like a side of beef or takes him out with karate chop to the neck, distills any amount of sex and violence into a single unforgettable mythic figure. Similarly the vastly underrated Stuart Lancaster is the very personification of sleazy misogyny. Add to this the brilliant build-up of the opening monologue, Meyer's masterful editing and Jack Moran's eminently quotable and often hilariously funny camp dialogue and you have a trash film masterpiece that just gets better and better the more times you watch it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQzODhjOTktZDY2ZS00Y2E0LTgwZWEtNzdlOWI4MjY4OWMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUxOTQ5MzA@._V1_UY209_CR7,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

On the outside his father is a well respected civil servant but on the inside he's , prone to manic depression, and abusive husband as well as an neglecting father.Martins mother(Amanda Ooms) is weak, cannot stand up against her husband and can only watch as the family slowly unravels in front of her eyes.

This film is also loosely based on real life crime story ""The Sandhamn gang"" that was brought down by the police in the 1970's. The biggest surprise is the strong direction, acting and high production values regarding set designs, clothes music etc. Director Hannes Holm usually makes very mainstream Swedish rom coms, comedy dramas, that hasn't made much impact on me but this is clearly(so far at least)his best film.Bill SkarsgÃÂ¥rd is the son of famous Swedish Stellan SkarsgÃÂ¥rd (his two other acting sons are Alexander SkarsgÃÂ¥rd, Gustaf SkarsgÃÂ¥rd)does a pretty good job but most impressive is the sourrounding cast; Peter Dalle is very good(winner Goldbug award best male actor for this role), BjÃÂ¶rn Kjellman as the alcoholic father etc.The only criticism one can say is that screenplay has some flaws, the story sometimes predictable, certain characters not that interesting but overall a very good Swedish film, easily compared to international productions such as: Lords of Dogtown (2005),A Bronx Tale (1993)etc.Biggest surprise..?

Videos and DVDs should be released only in a double-box.Most ""Musketeer"" movies are travesties loosely based on Dumas.  The 1993 version with Chris O'Donnell is a case in point.  It uses little more than the names of characters, and it's woefully inadequate.The script-writer in Lester's ""Musketeers"" movies was George MacDonald Fraser, author of the ""Flashman"" series.  And Fraser, unlike writers of all other ""Musketeer"" movies, seems to have read the book.  Some of the wildest things in both movies (for instance, Buckingham's shrine to Anne of Austria) are actually from Dumas.  The script, rambunctious and silly as sometimes is, is startlingly close to the book.Rumor has it that Lester envisioned ""Musketeers"" as a project for the Beatles.  If this is true, he's fortunate he lost them.  The cast is uniformly wonderful.  Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain, and Frank Finlay are perfect in their roles (Finlay is particularly marvelous as he, not a large man, is able to portray the huge, blustering Porthos).  Michael York is a fun D'artagnan.  Faye Dunaway and Christopher Lee are suitably evil.  Rachel Welch, the Pamela Anderson of the late '60s, shows a flair for light comedy that was not often utilized (most of her other movies highlight her . . . ahem . . . other talents).  Charlton Heston is the anchor at the center of the film as the scheming Richelieu.  He doesn't have much screen time, but his presence dominates the movies, as well it should.  Lester also has small parts filled with amazing talents, including Spike Milligan and Roy Kinnear. Keep your eye on a genuine Frenchman, Jean-Pierre Cassel, as the king (and, much later, in Lester's ""Return of the Musketeers"", as Cyrano);  he's a delight in every scene.Lester's locations are fabulous.  His France looks lived-in.  One gets the sense of a long, medieval period that has decayed by the time of D'artagnan in the early 1600s, and of a struggling monarchy dominated by the Cardinal trying to rebuild it.  Even Cardinal Richelieu, who wasn't really evil, comes off as three-dimensional (compare Heston's subtle performance to Tim Curry's bizarre, anti-historical, one-dimensional inquisitor and fool in the 1993 version).Being ""The Three (Four) Musketeers"", there are many sword-fights; Lester somehow is not a great action director, but he somehow manages to make each duel unique, and funny.  In ""The Four Musketeers"" he's given us a duel on the ice between York and Lee that's very funny.  And the climactic duel in a church is sublime.In 1989 Lester released ""Return of the Musketeers"" with the same cast. Fraser's brief script for that movie (about 100 minutes) gives us the gist of ""Twenty Years After"", and is quite amusing and a good coda for the series (it's a shame Lester didn't get a chance to do ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" with a G. M. Fraser script and the same cast.  The version with Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich will do, though it's darker and less loyal to Dumas).On the whole, ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers"" are the best Musketeer movies ever made.  They star men and women who were at the top of their profession at the time.  The scripts are superb and there's not a wasted moment.  Do not accept lesser substitutes.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTcwNjM3NGUtYjRlYy00ODNjLTliYzMtMzkzOTBhNGJjMTZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I hope that one day even teen-movies from U.S.A. can be a little sophisticated and subtle.I really like Julia Stiles as an actress and I admire her talent but I simply doesn't get why she's able to participate in such a simplified film. The old-fashioned love story is kind of great, but when you have some knowledge of how Danish society actually functions you can't really appreciate this movie as you're supposed to.Facts about Denmark: The Royal Family doesn't take part in politics and none of the members are allowed to vote at elections. The actual Danish Crown Prince, Frederik 10th, has been studying Political Science at Harvard University (92-93) without any undercover servant/nanny, can you believe that!(just kidding)To sum up the plot itself is okay, but the superficial way of portraying Europeans is a bad habit a lot of Americans has, sorry but true.

My point is that Europe contains several different cultures and the countries are actually easy to separate from one another.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTllMGQzZGQtNzZmMy00ZjA2LWExNzMtYjViNGU4YzRmNGE2L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Although it does slowly progress, the day-to-day life on the inside seems repetitive and predictable, particularly when the overall message is all too familiar and practically clichÃÂ©d. All in all however, Starred Up is one of the best prison dramas in a long time, and probably the best British film this year. Not for the faint-hearted, this superbly acted drama will scare you into following the law to the strictest command.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczOTY4MTg2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTM2NzcxMjE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

However, higher ups in the dream research program may have ulterior, nefarious motives.Dreamscape may be a good candidate for ""most misleading poster art"". The theatrical poster, which is also the DVD cover, suggests a kid-oriented, slightly hokey adventure film--perhaps a combination of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), The Neverending Story (1984) and ""The Hardy Boys Mysteries"" (1977). Not that the combination sounds like a bad idea to me, but this film is much more adult, much more sci-fi, and more of a thriller. It's not really an adventure, although some of the dream material could be seen that way. The tone, if not content, is closer to something like Coma (1978), and later films like Flatliners (1990) and The Cell (2000), the latter being obviously influenced by Dreamscape. It also has a bit of the bizarre surrealist tone of late-1970s fare such as Phantasm (1979) (and this aspect also influenced films like The Cell).Part of the reason the films works as well as it does is the cast. Dennis Quaid carries the film, frequently injecting enjoyable comic relief. Max von Sydow is always excellent. Kate Capshaw, as Jane DeVries, is also good as the research assistant and Alex' love interest. Although they're underused, Christopher Plummer, Eddie Albert, George Wendt and David Patrick Kelly all turn in superb performances as well.Director Joseph Ruben frequently treats us to great dream sequences, with often-subtle touches. Note, for example, the different colors upon entering different persons' dreams. For the relatively benign construction worker, the entry is blue. For the child troubled with nightmares, there is a complex of colors. For Jane, who is giving Alex the cold shoulder, the color is an icy silver-white. Although the film was relatively low budget, and effects relatively primitive at the time, I thought all of the effects worked well. I even loved the part stop-motion, part guy-in-a-costume snake-man. At times the stop motion work briefly resembled Harryhausen. I especially loved the more surreal and more horrific aspects of the dreamworlds, such as we see from Eddie Albert's character, the expressionistic sets for the child's dream, the zombies, and so on.Surprisingly, perhaps, Dreamscape is also much more effective on the suspense/thriller end than I expected it to be. There are a few great chase scenes, and one brutal (though not graphic) murder on-screen, one off-screen. It was also steamier than I expected in one section.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM3YzQ4YzItYzUzOS00MjNkLWI2YWEtZTQ0ZGFjYjg4YWQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

And given my life-long love of the horror genre and Asian movies, of course I needed no persuasion to sit down and watch this movie.Writer Riheam Junianti put together a fair enough script. It was entertaining for sure, but at the same time writer Riheam Junianti was cashing in on a lot of stereotypical horror tropes, which sort of made certain aspects of ""Panggonan Wingit"" a bit mundane and generic. I am not saying that it is a bad movie, far from it, because I definitely enjoyed the storyline, and I am sure that newcomers to the horror genre will get a kick out of watching this movie. As a life-long horror aficionado, however, I found the movie to be good but not impressive.Given my relatively brief exposure to the Indonesian cinema, then I was only familiar with leading actress Luna Maya in this movie. I will say, though, that the acting performances in the movie were good. The actor Egy Fedly, playing the spiritualist Ki Danang, was really well-cast for his role, because he put on quite a memorable and convincing performance.""Panggonan Wingit"" has a fair amount of blood and visual mayhem, without being over-the-top. So director Guntur Soeharjanto managed to take something that was used in moderation and get something good from it. I liked the special effects, props, sets, and wardrobe in the movie.Running at 110 minutes, the movie could perhaps have benefitted a bit from a more generous trim in the editing room.Worth sititng down to watch if you enjoy horror and Asian genre, of course. But it is hardly a movie that warrants more than just a single viewing.My rating of director Guntur Soeharjanto's 2023 movie ""Panggonan Wingit"" lands on a five out of ten stars.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTZmZWViMzEtYjJhYy00YjI3LTgxZGYtY2M5MWNhZjQ5NDc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTg2MDI2Njc@._V1_UY209_CR13,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

When I first watched this show back a  couple of years ago, it just caught me like no other had ever done before. The characters, the settings, the stories, all just magnificent.One thing a lot of people pick on is the writing. I, myself, do not have a problem with it at all. In fact, I find that the stories make this show one of the most unique sci-fi's ever done. The 12 Colonies of Man all decimated by the Cylon Empire and the struggle of the refugees to survive, all escaping in some 220 refugee ships all being protected by the Galactica herself in search of the planet earth. And let's not forget the other memorable stories, such as the discovery of Commander Cain & the Battlestar Pegasus and when the Galactica found Kobol and discovered some of the origins of men. There's also the stories involving the Ship of Lights, Terra, and other ships from within the rag-tag fleet.Another highlight of the show is the characters, especially Adama, Apollo, and Starbuck. One could say that Adama was the father figure, the wisest of the group. Then there's Apollo, just one of them good ole boys. And then we have Starbuck, probably the most memorable character from the entire series. And let's not forget the others: Boomer, Jolly, Athena, Cassiopeia, Boxey, Muffit, and last, but definitely not least, Baltar. Yes, this menacing figure is probably the 2nd most memorable face in the series.And let's not forget the Cylons. These guys were probably one of the biggest money makers of the series back then. Menacing and powerful, they will stop at nothing until the destruction of the human race is complete.One of the biggest highlights of this production is the music. Who can forget the opening theme? No doubt one of the greatest in all of sci-fi. We also have the Cylon music, very dark and menacing. In this production, Stu Phillips was a genius and he should definitely be commended.Now, the special effects are something to be admired as well. Created by Star Wars' own John Dykstra, the effects in Battlestar Galactica greatly outshined the rest at that time. Though, the biggest drawback is the constant reuse of special effects footage over and over and over and over again. But it was done to save money, so it's understandable.Another memorable aspect of the show are the ships themselves. The Galactica, herself, is a huge and powerful vessel, while retaining a charm that few other ships can keep. Probably the most popular ship was the Colonial Viper. While they may resemble the X-Wing Starfighters of Star Wars, the Vipers are unique and special in their own way. Probably the most unique ship in the show was the Cylon Raider. Bat-like in appearance, it was a fierce competitor for the Viper. Then there's the Cylon Basestar, just plain menacing is all that can be said about it. Then there are the other ships: The Rising Star, The Colonial Movers ship, The Celestra, The Prison Barge, The Livery ship, The Gemini Freighter, etc. They all were memorable in their own way.This show is VERY underrated. A work of art, in my very honest opinion. I give it a 10/10. Extremely brilliant.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMyMDQ1NjItNzMzZi00MTk5LTgzNzEtNDZjOGIzMmZhNzRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDY4MzkyNw@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He arrives in a small village, keeping secret his ability as a swordsman.  The village is split with rival gangs, one of whom hires a troubled but talented samurai to wipe the others out.  Meanwhile two beautiful geisha sisters are more than they appear.  Into the middle of the impending bloody conflict walks Zatoichi.One of the good things about Kill Bill may well be that it brings a wider audience to the martial arts genre from the Far East on a bigger scale. If that is the case then this is one of the films that they will likely come to first in the cinema, as it is about to have a full UK release.  I was able to see this as part of the Birmingham Screen Festival 2004, so I was in a full audience that was ready and willing to be entertained and this may have helped me enjoy it more than a half full cinema of people who have just drifted in.  With or without this atmosphere I found this to be an enjoyable, stylish, funny and violent film - but not without flaws.The biggest flaw is the plot sadly.  At it's heart it is a good story, but the manner of delivery really hamstrings it's ability to engage and grip. I have read that it was meant to be a homage/spoof of operas, and my very astute (and beautiful!) friend told me that the way of having lots of minor characters to almost cover costume changes for the main actors is a musical thing and that the film reminded her of that.  While I accept that may be the reason for the way the film is, it doesn't change the fact that it didn't work for me.  The films starts with difficulty - it is hard to follow with so many characters and gangs of which we are given no history to work with.  This continues for much of the film, with minor characters coming and going, partly contributing to the overall story but also breaking up the flow with subplots that are never really explained or understood.This trend continues, with the film never getting a real tension or pace to it.  The conclusion of the film is a bit of a letdown - although I may have been conditioned to expect `the big showdown' in this genre.  It still works pretty well but I just had a pretty big problem with the way the story flowed (or didn't).  This is not to downplay how much I did enjoy it.  The film has a great thread surrounding Osei where he acts as a comic relief - all his stuff is very funny and it really helps to break the tension; it's just the things like the bodyguard's subplot - nothing explained yet quite a lot of weight put on him.  While it does lack pace, tension and punch, it still works well enough to hold the action together.The fights are bloody, stylish and enjoyable although I fear that those weaned on Kill Bill's excess will not accept it as gory enough.  The use of CGI blood may be a problem as well - personally I found it to compliment the otherworldly effect of the film by being almost more pronounced than `real' blood would be.  The fights are enjoyable, although they are perhaps a little too brief - certainly some of the more important fights were over way too quickly and without ceremony.  Generally though, the film looks amazing. Each shot is framed really well and, where the characters are still or set against a big background, many of the shots would look great on a poster. The sets are fantastic and really capture the sense of period and place. As director, Takeshi really has done well even if he could have done with a bit more help on the action front.The cast are roundly superb even where the are let down by the material a little bit in terms of their characters.  Takeshi plays his character with an easy going humour that contrasts nicely with his sudden, violent movements at key moments.  Easily the standout performance though is from Taka, who brings so much to the film with his likeable, comic fool.  He is very funny throughout the film and his lack of background is not a problem as none of his strands call upon that like the others do.  Asano's bodyguard is interesting but sadly poorly served by the material.  The two sisters are OK but again their performances are overshadowed by the fact that their sections of the film are not as strong as need be - the slightly corny CGI ending involving them is only corny because I didn't have sufficient buy in to their characters to care that much.  The various villains fail to impose themselves on the film but enough is done by Takeshi and Taka to keep the audience engaged.Overall I did really enjoy this film.  It was visually very stylish, funny, engaging and enjoyable.  It has flaws with the structure, the plotting in regards characters and suffers from a lack of real excitement or consistent tension but it is still more than worth seeing.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ2MzNmZDYtZDExNi00MDA2LWFkNjYtY2I4N2E4NzkzOTEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

After realizing that they want to sacrifice him because of his virgin blood, he sets out on a mission to lose his virginity by sunrise. Think ""American Pie"" meets ""Superbad"".Having low expectations, I'm happy to say we were quite surprised with it. There were plenty of laughs and we were all chuckling a lot by the end. The two lead actors have a great rapport, probably due to them being good friends in real life, and all the others in supporting positions are just enough to keep things moving along at a good pace.

We were also lucky enough to hear the director, producer, and one of the cast members (Annie Clark) talk about the creation of the film a bit. They were all quite personable and funny, which explains the tongue-in-cheek humour of the movie a lot.All in all, it's absolutely worth the 90 minutes or so. It's no Shakespeare, but solid nonetheless!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTUyZTFiYmQtZDhhZC00YjhkLWJjNTktNjFlMjBkNTgwNjE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDgyODgxNjE@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"
"Les yeux sans visage","2023.0","Not Rated","90.0","Drama, Horror","7.6","90.0","Georges Franju","Pierre Brasseur, Alida Valli, Juliette Mayniel, Alexandre Rignault","35,219","A surgeon causes an accident which leaves his daughter disfigured and goes to extreme lengths to give her a new face.","144","Surreal fantasy masterpiece","Georges Franju's atmospheric masterpiece is a tapestry of contradictions. Eyes Without a Face is a compelling tale of sadism that has an astute tenderness at the same time. A film that will disgust you with it's macabre imagery, yet simultaneously mesmerise you with it's beauty; a seething tale of love, fashioned by extreme guilt. Through the Gothic confines of a grandiose mansion, Franju has taken ideas from classic stories such as 'Frankenstein' and constructed a dream like surrealistic fantasy that has inspired legions of filmmakers since: from obvious inspirations like Jess Franco's The Awful Dr Orlof, all the way to the full blown Hollywood action fest, Face/Off; Eyes Without a Face stands out as one of cinema's most important, yet most overlooked films. The central story is a deliriously simple tale of vanity, guilt and redemption; yet one that is lent a great depth from it's cast of central characters. Doctor GÃÂ©nessier, guilt ridden over a car accident that left his beloved daughter, Christiane, with a destroyed face uses his assistant to kidnap young girls in an attempt to reconstruct her ruined features. The good doctor peels the faces from his victims and grafts them over the ruined features of his young daughter. However, the experiments are a continual failure but, motivated by a strong sense of guilt, Doctor GÃÂ©nessier must keep trying. The doctor himself is a masterpiece of horror film villainy. Unlike many mad scientists since, the doctor here is firmly placed within reality which makes his motivations easy to believe and therefore the horror all the more fascinating. He is supported by his assistant, Louise; a fellow web of intrigue. Louise isn't the normal mad doctor's assistant; she isn't deformed, or demented but rather a cunning, malevolent and cerebral predator; gathering her victims to aid the doctor's latest experiment. The real masterpiece of characterisation, however, comes from the central character; the disfigured tragedy herself, Christiane. The scenes that see her float around in her mask gown are some of the most memorable ever brought to the screen. While wearing her mask, Christiane represents both life and death. The mask itself is stagnant and lifeless, but the eyes beneath the mask are full of life's beauty, giving the young girl a surrealistic look that epitomises the film in that it's hard to place; is it beautiful, or revolting; good or evil? This film is a rare treat in that it's actually frightening. Eyes Without a Face taps into the viewer's fears by presenting us with a situation that is terrifying because it involves a central character living with horror. You can have all the maniacs with all the weapons you can think of; but it doesn't compare to having to go to bed every night with a face that is scarred beyond redemption. A fate worse than death, I'm sure you'll agree. This premise is given conviction through a stark and constantly foreboding atmosphere, which comes as a result of Eugen Shuftan's magnificent cinematography. The film has a crisp and clean look, which brilliantly offsets the macabre scenes that it is capturing. Thankfully, Georges Franju also seems keen to keep the focus on the surreal horror aspects of the story, which is shown by the way that he rushes through the police investigation that stems from the doctor's experiments. The film also features a striking and memorable musical score. The music sounds like it wouldn't be out of place in a carnival or circus, which fits the movie brilliantly as it covers the weird and wonderful imagery that we are treated to on screen.Overall, Eyes Without a Face is a magnificent expression of the horror genre. The creativity and beauty of the film are sure to delight anyone who encounters it, and this is as important and as breathtaking as anything cinema has to offer. All I can say is that the word 'masterpiece' was added to the English language with this film in mind.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMzOTc5ZTYtMjkyZS00Njk4LTllNzYtNDViZmU0Yzk0ZDVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUzNzgxODE@._V1_UY209_CR8,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The answer is no.It is incredibly worse.Ladies and gentlemen this flick has cracked my top ten on the list of the worst movies ever made. It is truly that terrible.The film, if you can even call it that, has no virtually no story or plot. It is honest to god, a bunch of sketches. Something off of SNL or Mad TV, but for raunchy. There is one character that runs throughout the entire film and he tries to get the girl. Nothing new, original or funny there.The ""film"" for some reason has recognizable names. Stars like Jamie Kennedy, Matthew Lillard, Frankie Muniz and Michael Cera. This ""film"" is an embarrassment for all involved and should be locked away with films like Belly or Carnivore.Non of the sketches are funny. We've seen all these things before. It tries to be edgy, but comes off as juvenile. A woman gets her cellphone stuck in her vagina and it constantly goes off, pleasuring her at the most inappropriate times. A kid buys a sex toy, a life like vagina and the entire skit is his relationship with it, it becomes jealous and kills itself. Matthew Lillard some unknown reason inter cuts the sketches with unoriginal jokes that your father probably knows.The only tolerable bit was Cera, and it's only because he sells it, not the writing.For the love of god and all that is good, never watch this trash.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDAzNzQ4MDEtOGViNi00YjliLTlkMmItNjc0YWRhZGJhMDJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

So what is so wrong with this movie that it warrants such a low rating and so many negative comments? In my humble opinion absolutely nothing's 'wrong' with it, in fact I thoroughly enjoyed viewing it. The plot doesn't offend (it is what it has to be as a parody - KISS simple), the scriptwriting is excellent, the camera work/lighting is professionally done and the actors all do their part well. There was a synergism between the principal actors and they worked together really well. I can understand that the movie will not be to everyone's taste: the humor certainly is a little raspy-raw toilet humor at times but that certainly did not define the humorous content of the movie as a whole and there's an unashamed borrowing of ideas and more from other movies: but it works and works amazingly well! After reading other reviewers comments I didn't expect much from this movie but kept an open mind and I'm glad I did otherwise I'd have missed out on a very enjoyable movie experience.If I had to pick the most notable actor in this movie it would have to be the guy with the beard for his extraordinary portrayal of 'the other' guy with the beard in 'the other' movie. I also have to admit that I'm a fan of the beautifully sexy Rita Volk and she didn't disappoint. In summary then, nicely controlled tongue in cheek performances from the entire cast make for a very good laugh out loud piece of film entertainment. I rate it 6.5.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NjM3MDk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTEzNTY3MDE@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

To me, she's always great to look at listen to, especially with a comedy here. This is about as good as she's ever looked. I also enjoyed her narration. Also, with director John Landis, you almost always get a very entertaining movie.The special effects in here are fun to watch and the general off-the-wall humor is great. If you appreciate dark humor, you'll like this movie. The filmmakers also did not go overlong on the action scenes. The film is almost a put-on about vampire movies. The negatives are too much profanity, too much for a comedy. It sometimes gets ridiculous. Robert Loggia plays most of the profane characters I've ever heard on film, yet is very funny at times. The gore is overdone in parts, too, but nowadays - even watching television (i.e. CSI) - we're used to that now. My other complaint is why this DVD is not on widescreen.

No description does it justice, no warning truly gives you an idea of what you are in store for.  Few movies are as bizarre, yet oddly compelling at the same time.Because one movie wasn't enough to contain these people; Breakin 2 picks up where the first movie picks off.  Or so I assume, I haven't seen Breakin, but the three main characters Kelly (Lucinda Dickey), Ozone (Adolfo Quinones) and Turbo (Michael Chambers) are the same.  In this installment the trio try to save a youth center named Miracles from the clutches of evil (read: white and unhip) government bigwigs who want to bulldoze the unsafe building and make way for a new shopping center.It's fortunate that the trio live in an alternate universe in which breakdancing can solve all of society's ills.  No exaggeration here; over the course of ninety-four boogie filled minutes, dancing stops bulldozers, pays bills, ends gang wars, and even cures the ill and the infirm (One person bounds out of the wheelchair in jubilation; apparently they simply forgot they could walk).  There is so much dancing in this movie that it frequently appears that the plot is intruding on it, and not the other way around.  These are people who work a hard day's living dancing then go home and blow off some steam by, what else, dancing.This isn't a poorly made movie in the traditional sense; it isn't full of continuity holes or bad special effects.  For all its silliness, it probably succeeds in exactly the way it wanted to; as a movie about people who love breakdancing so much they'd rather do that than say, eat, sleep, converse, or share meaningful human contact.  More than fifteen years later, it's terribly quaint, and hilariously dated.  But it has a city-wide dance party, a hospital-wide dance party, a dance-filled climax (a shock, I know) and two performances by Ice-T.  What more do you want?  Do yourself a favor and rent this movie.  By the end, you'll be dancing too.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMwNGI0NzAtY2U1Zi00MTI3LTk2NWQtMTU0ZmQ3OGZmMjc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It portrays his victories, controversies, rebellious persona challenging tennis norms, and his influence as a tennis rebel icon.","2","Entertaining Is the Game","Ilie Nastase, the first ATP world number 1, is vividly brought to life in a documentary that celebrates his numerous titles and larger-than-life personality. This makes for a highly entertaining film that captures Nastase's charm, but also falls short in structural coherence and depth, leaving many potentially interesting aspects of his life unexplored. The early years are notably absent, offering only a glimpse into his fiery nature and leaving most of the root causes to the viewer's imagination.The documentary, while touching lightly on the political and social context of the late 20th century, focuses more on reminiscing about an era of professional tennis that is gone now - one marked by a closer, more informal camaraderie and stronger personalities. Nastase might be seen as intolerable today but was a product of his times, contributing to the sport's transformation. Or maybe just witnessing it. The narrative conveys warmth and nostalgia through testimonials, past and present, from tennis legends like Arthur Ashe and Billie Jean King, who reflect on Nastase's complex personality with a mix of admiration and bemusement.Despite its engaging content and archival footage, the film struggles with pacing and clarity, often feeling like a fragmented collection of anecdotes about Nastase's talent and temperament. It veers towards impermanence and is afraid to look deeper into his legacy and how aging and leaving the limelight has affected such a complicated personality.Nevertheless, the documentary succeeds in capturing the essence of Nastase's flamboyant character, making it a compelling watch for those interested in the history of tennis. And for those longing for ""the good old days"".","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODViYTIwNzEtMWZjYy00NzJiLWFhMWMtNWQ0ZDRmZWQzYjhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcwNDM0ODI@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

His best friends, Mike and Slim, are both stressed trying to work out where they could be when they both get pages from his ex-girlfriend.  They go to her house to find him drunk and experiencing doubts.  As they drive around, sober him up and dry clean their suits for the wedding, they take time to uncover why he has doubts and also take a trip down memory lane and where they grew up in Inglewood.Having seen several films on the trot where race is used to `comic' effect in a string of endless racist jokes it was refreshing to sit and watch a film where the cast were almost 100% black but the story was not told in relation to the colour of it's characters.  Instead the story is a straight story of childhood memories and it could easily have been any culture telling it.  Of course there is a thread of black culture running through the film but it is simply there as opposed to being the focus.The story is slight and not totally together but it is interesting.  The reasons for Roland's doubts are not made totally clear by the end of the film and there is a suggestion that it is really just a frame for the memories to occur within.  This isn't too bad as the memories are really more of the story than the modern day trigger is.  Both strands work quite well as long as you don't expect too much, it has a gentle humour that is pleasant and enjoyable and both strands seem to be able to carry it.  The `to-camera' narration was a bit of a risk that I thought it didn't totally carry off but, happily, after the first 10 minutes it is pretty much absent for the rest of the film.  Some of the strands don't totally come to a close and the fact that the main plot (Roland going missing on his wedding day) is mostly a side issue is a distraction but not to a detrimental point.The cast are all pretty good.  Epps is a good lead and is a likeable character.  Diggs is good looking but he doesn't act as well as he can for much of the movie ÃÂ his `drunk' acting is pretty poor although he gets better as he sobers up.  Jones is a bit of a comedy figure but does his job well despite being the least developed of the three.  The teenage actors all carry themselves well, although in this modern tabloid world of hysteria it is a little uncomfortable to watch two young teenagers have sex (although I was relieved to find that the sexy one of them, Malinda Williams, was actually 24 when she played a 14 year old).  The women are all very good looking but have lesser roles as the males take the meat of the story ÃÂ Tamala Jones is good and Epps' co-star from Love & Basketball (Sanaa Lathan) joins him for a brief role.Overall it is a very light film that has a plot in a very basic sense but is really more of a nostalgic trip down the teenage years that is told with honesty and humour.  It may not resemble any life I ever had but there were themes I could relate to.  Slight but fun and, after seeing National Security, Undercover Brother and Bringing Down the House (where race is used for humour, rather than being a side issue) The Wood was also a breath of fresh air.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTI4MWU2MGEtMGE3MS00MGU2LWJlNTUtM2I2MzEzMTBlYzgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MTM5NjI2._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

You really felt like Rothrock's performance when she sheds tears at a very nasty incident was quite convincing.  Another thing that works in the film's favour is the chemistry between Rothrock and co-star Richard Norton (Australian Karate exponent). As you might expect, though, the fights are what this and its sequel are really about, and these are some of the best Western fights ever, I reckon.

"De Sade 70","2023.0","","87.0","Drama, Horror","5.2","","JesÃÂºs Franco","Maria Rohm, Marie Liljedahl, Jack Taylor, Christopher Lee","2,002","An innocent girl goes to spend the weekend on an island with a woman and her brother, but soon finds herself entangled in a web of sexual experiments.","20","EUGENIE...THE STORY OF HER JOURNEY INTO PERVERSION (1969) ***","Having read a lot of positive reviews about this film on the Internet (and the mystique surrounding it due to unavailability), it was no real surprise that it would be the first Jess Franco title I decided to seek out. Overall, I'm very glad I finally took the plunge to discover for myself Franco's very distinctive world-view. And I know this is one film I'll be looking forward to watch again ÃÂ and not purely for its exploitation value, mind you!De Sade was most certainly a writer ahead of his time, so the updating to modern times comes off particularly well here. Production values are efficient enough and generally manage to belie the low-budget Franco and producer Harry Alan Towers had to work with; Franco's mise-en-scene is quite confident and the film is certainly good to look at. Still, what holds one's attention here is the invigorating 'atmosphere' of decadence which Franco manages to create around a flimsy but fascinating plot. Perhaps thankfully, the film is not all that long so that it does not overstay its welcome.While there is certainly a great deal of nudity on display, the film rises above being mere exploitation fare - which I assume is a rare feat for this director, considering his notorious reputation. It is aided a great deal by genuinely interesting characterizations, particularly the two female leads: Eugenie's blind faith in her obviously more experienced mentor is so complete that she doesn't realize until too late that she is being manipulated; Marianne herself comes off as fairly sympathetic despite her devious nature ÃÂ all in all, a human being, and we feel sorry for her when she dies (at least, I did!); even the minor supporting characters are put to good use, like the black boatman/guitar player and the deaf-mute servant, which is not often the case with these type of films.Having said all this, I would be lying if I said I thought that EUGENIEÃÂ THE STORY OF HER JOURNEY INTO PERVERSION was a perfect viewing experience. Despite the attractive scenery, I found the numerous out-of-focus shots very distracting and rather than aiding the hallucinatory nature of the story, they end up being merely annoying. Furthermore, I felt that some of the S & M sequences could have been better staged. Besides, there are some inconsistencies in the plot as well: whereas the black boatman is at first depicted as being contrary to the pagan practices, he is seen to join in during the final ceremony where Marianne meets her come-uppance.The casting is OK, I guess, but it still comes up short in my opinion: Marie Liljedahl, nice-looking though she obviously is, is not entirely comfortable with the complexities of her role (particularly towards the end, where she is unable to properly communicate Eugenie's psychological 'degradation') [N.B.: I tend to agree with what Glenn Erickson wrote about this in his review of the R1 DVD on the 'DVD Savant' website: 'The supposed 'corruption' of Eugenie is completely unconvincing - she remains a duped puppet. When she kills the first time it is out of fear, and the second time is just not fully explained. You don't get the idea that she's progressed to the point where she can 'replace' her hostess in the cult, and that turns out not to be the plan anyway.']; likewise, Jack Taylor - though suitably enigmatic and, at times, even vulnerable - hardly makes for a compelling screen presence. On the other hand, for me, Maria Rohm is the focus of the entire film and she also gives the best performance. Christopher Lee, despite his brief appearance, is smoothly sinister and a definite plus to the proceedings; in fact, he and Rohm make for a much more convincingly 'evil' pair. Then there is Bruno Nicolai's music: a very fine score and a memorable one, but which I feel is, in spots, a bit too jovial for its purpose.I had already read that the story of the film was 'imagined' by Marianne in online reviews, but it still managed to take me by surprise when it happened. At first I was a bit let-down by this 'flashback' device ÃÂ for me the film would have ended ideally when Eugenie runs out of the house, comes upon the graves on the beach and realizes that she is trapped on the island which is enclosed by barbed wire. Even the next morning shot when the police siren is heard sounding off in the distance was rather unnecessary. However, upon realizing that everything that we had been watching has yet to take place, rather than seeming a 'cop-out' (akin to what contemporary critics had said of the similar ending to Fritz Lang's marvelous THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW [1944]), it just added a new layer of subversion to the proceedings. It not only implies that Marianne actually relishes the thought of perishing at the hands of her beloved Eugenie but also that this eventuality would be the epitome of a vicious circle of lovers killing each other as a climactic finale on which to end their relationship, tenuous as that may have been: Mirvel (Marianne's stepbrother and long-time lover) kills Theresa (also perhaps once Marianne's lover); Mirvel is in turn killed by Eugenie (Marianne's present lover); Eugenie was to have been killed by Marianne but with the aid of Dolmance (conceivably once also Marianne's lover) kills Marianne instead; Dolmance (also presumably lusting for Eugenie) double-crosses her and pins all three murders onto her, etc.The acceptance of the dream-state as the environment in which the film is ultimately taking place seems to excuse and indeed justify some of those technical fallacies and character inconsistencies of which I spoke earlier, for what dream is anything but an imperfect and half-remembered rendition of real-life events? In the end, therefore, the impression I was left with regarding the ending was more comparable to the open-ended and ambiguous one found in Luis Bunuel's magnificent BELLE DE JOUR (1967) which could be interpreted in any number of legitimate ways.Though the film was apparently shot in English, the soundtrack was looped later in the studio. In this respect, it isn't too bad if not always in synch which can prove a distraction. After the many glowing reviews I had read, I found the DVD transfer to be somewhat disappointing (even if I can entirely understand its shortcomings) but, as it is, there is simply too much grain in exterior shots and the print is also a little faded in spots. The extras are fantastic: the 17-minute documentary is excellent indeed, particularly Franco's sincere ruminations about the film and his own working conditions; he comes off as a quite pleasant, even intelligent, man ÃÂ and completely unpretentious. Tim Lucas' liner notes are a good read, even if he feels a bit over-awed by the film's many (and doubtless genuine) 'qualities'.In the end, EUGENIEÃÂTHE STORY OF HER JOURNEY INTO PERVERSION - or, as it's called on Anchor Bay UK's R2 disc, MARQUIS DE SADE'S PHILOSOPHY IN THE BOUDOIR - may not be a very subtle film (certainly not much is left to the spectator's imagination) but, for all its faults, is quite often a sublime one.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJlMDU0OGEtZmFkOS00NzU1LThkYWUtY2Y0N2I4ODM0ZjAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjQ5NzM@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

January releases are always a bit of a gamble - not just for filmmakers, but also for viewers. A few gems are often buried in the indie dump, so an open mind is especially beneficial and necessary this time of year. Landing somewhere in between the hidden gems and the muck is this B-movie crime thriller from writer-director John Stalberg Jr, and his co-writers Rex New and Nick Turner.Like so many immigrants to the United States, Felix (Diego Tinoco) is a bright-eyed man, desperate to work and save enough money to relocate his family from Ecuador. At a local convenience store one morning, Donnie (Luke Hemsworth) offers a job (digging a hole in the desert) to Felix and another day-laborer named Alfonso (Hemky Madera, ""Queen of the South""). While Felix seems eager and friendly, Alfonso is grumpy and hardened, but it's Donnie and his cohort who turn out to be psychopaths and criminals. Things turn violent with a blast of gunfire and a pickax to the chest. Felix and Alfonso find themselves knee deep in a botched drug deal and are forced to become partners in order to survive.Alfonso's secret past as 'God Killer' works to their advantage, and soon enough he has called in a favor from a skittish scumbag (Thomas Jane) who runs a junk lot with a car crusher. He also has a contact for a local veterinarian (Nick Cassavetes) who is on-call for, um, non-pet medical emergencies. On their tail is a fixer (Tyrese Gibson) who works for the ""gringos"" on one side of the drug deal gone wrong. Working to the film's advantage is that the actors are all fully engaged and never distract from a situation that most of us can't exactly relate to (thank goodness).Felix has a dream of bringing his family to the states and opening a restaurant that features his specialty: chicken with pumpkin. While I will likely never try his signature dish, I found this little movie surprisingly easy to watch - despite the violence and low budget (and inconsistencies with Hemsworth's arm).Opening in select theaters and VOD on January 26, 2024.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGU5MTJkYjAtZTczMi00ZWNkLThiOTktNWY0ZjhiNzFkMDRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzUwMDA5NDE@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

As some guy once said ""steal like an artist"" but with this one, it's like you're watching a weird reenactment of cool ideas from other movies without adding your own details or imprint or at least gluing them together with some sense.And this is the case with this movie. They made a soup of ideas from other films: vintage and sports cars, protagonists that get trapped in doing a ""job"" for the rich douche bag, pretty locations, chases, and cute faces.But when you add in really bad acting, way too many plot twists and side characters, an absolute lack of chemistry between the main actors, boring racing scenes and some of the stupidest lines of dialogue one can only wonder how come no one realized it was destined to fail in such a loud way?Speaking of loudness - here is a message to its creators: turning that goddamn volume up to 1 million won't make it more entertaining but instead leave its viewers with a gigantic headache.I could, however, see 2 qualities in this racing flick: some pretty panoramic views of France (a la Fast and Furious, of course) and the protagonist half-brothers who actually felt like they were half brothers.Teens will probably fall in love with the cute faces but otherwise, you should stay away from this poor man's Fast and Furious because it ""overdrives"" far from its inspiration points way up to the realm of too much, or too little.

"Noroi","2023.0","","115.0","Horror, Mystery, Thriller","6.9","","KÃÂ´ji Shiraishi","Jin Muraki, Rio Kanno, Tomono Kuga, Marika Matsumoto","15,399","A documentary filmmaker explores seemingly unrelated paranormal incidents connected by the legend of an ancient demon called the ""kagutaba.""","88","The Scariest Film I've Ever Seen, and I've Seen A Lot","Note: Check me out as the ""Asian Movie Enthusiast"" on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies.Anyone familiar with horror films knows that most of them are not scary at all. Some people enjoy gorefests with subpar story lines and character development. I personally enjoy horror films that focus on atmosphere and interesting concepts (e.g., A Tale of Two Sisters, Kairo, etc.). Whatever the type of horror film one personally likes, there are only a select few that really scare you. Noroi is one of them.This is a documentary-style movie, which means that the entire film is a compilation of video clips that are linked by the legend of a demonic entity named Kagutaba. The premise is that a journalist filmed his own footage by interviewing people associated with the demonic rituals associated with Kagutaba, then compiled footage from other sources that link with his research. What results is a relentlessly chilling experience that feels very real and very disturbing, despite the fact that the story itself is fake.Some have compared Noroi with The Blair Witch Project, but the only similarity is the documentary style. One obvious difference between the films is that Noroi scares the viewer by linking events to one another using different sources. For example, the journalist records the exterior of a house that he is researching and sees something strange on the porch. Later in the film, a clip from another character's home video introduces that very same strange occurrence. The viewer's memory links the two incidents and chills start running down their spine. Another example involves a television show with a child psychic who answers every single question correctly except for one. In fact, her answer is so wrong that the viewer may wonder what the filmmakers were thinking. Later on, however, that wrong answer turns out to be linked to an extremely disturbing event. This is intelligent film-making indeed.Another difference between Noroi and Blair Witch is that Noroi provides not one, but two very long finales, the second of which is placed a minute after the credits start to roll and is the single greatest scare scene in the history of horror cinema. I do not say such things lightly. It totally wrecked me in a wonderous way.Other aspects of film-making are well done. The legend and ritualistic background of Kagutaba are very interesting and most of the actors did a good job. The only over-the-top performance comes from a guy who's supposed to be crazy anyway, so that's expected. The cinematography is intentionally gritty because all of the footage is supposed to represent videos shot on camcorders. Japanese films are not known for their special effects, but the effects used here were awesome. In some cases they create an other-worldly feel (e.g., the static interference or the first finale) but in other cases they are alarmingly realistic (e.g., the second finale).When all is said and done, Noroi goes down as the scariest film I've ever seen. I would go so far as to say that there is no film in existence that provides such sheer terror from beginning to end like Noroi does. See it now.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2E0MGIwNmItZjMxMS00OWYxLWFmZjYtOGRkYmJkOTVlNDAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Discovering ""Karusell"" has been one of the highlights of my year so far. In Taiwan, the film title was aptly translated ""Halloween"" (with the last syllable cleverly playing on the word for 'catastrophe' in Mandarin, which is quite intriguing). It's the best horror film I've seen this year. There are no Visual effects, no CGI, and none of those cheap jump scares where some devil suddenly pops on the screen. Instead, it showcases superb makeup artistry!The film's atmosphere is gripping, with the compelling storyboards keeping me on edge, as well as the escalating music (reminding me of ""Resident Evil"").The plot, while not complex, was yet rational. ""Empathy"" in this movie contributes a layer of the gravity of bullying in schools. It diverges from meaningless killing as in ""Final Destination"" or the ""Scream"" series. I don't understand why local Swedish audiences rated this masterpiece so low.I eagerly hope the filmmakers will make the sequel.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGNlNjk1MjctMDI4OS00MWI1LThjNDctZjhiYjc5ZWEwN2NiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTU5NTY0ODg0._V1_UY209_CR13,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I was hoping it would be like a frenetic, 90-minute episode. But there was also the fear that too many things might be changed for the hopes of making something ""accessible."" Unfortunately, the second part was what happened.Now the story is fine enough, yet another story surrounding the Belcher's inability to keep up with their bills. The kids go on an adventure to help the family and hijinks ensue. The foundation is there for sure. However, there is just too many ""buts"" for my taste.Let's start with the songs. Typically, songs within the show are pretty spontaneous and weird, and this is really the strength of the series. And then we get that first song....and it is endlessly awful. Maybe it was the improved animation that just made it weird looking, or just the rather lame lyrics. I don't know. This was a recurring problem, as each song was just more uninteresting than the last. That last song in the submarine room....woof! In all honesty, these were the biggest sins of the movie.The other problem...it was scaled back for general audiences. The kids are not as mouthy, the double entendres are gone, the innuendo is missing and just the energy is gone. While this sort of thing is built more for the half hour format, there was virtually no sight of this energy in the movie. I only assume the regular writers were exempt from the show to make it easier to sell to kids.Maybe I am expecting too much, but the shortcomings of this movie was very similar to The Simpsons movie. Maybe half hour shows should not be brought to the movie screen.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzFhNDNkY2UtYjc3ZS00NzVkLTlhNzEtYmZiZGMzYmRjMjVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

For one thing, to describe the plot would be to give away the twists and thus spoil its surprises; but for another, it's impossible to take a great work of art and put it into words. That said, here goes:Truth be told, it was the promise of Gael Garcia Bernal (whom I've loved since ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") in drag that piqued my interest in seeing ""Bad Education."" The only other Almodovar movie I'd seen before this was ""Talk to Her,"" which I was on the fence about, but if Gael Garcia Bernal was involved, I was happy to give Almodovar another shot. (Interestingly, ""Bad Education"" has given me a new appreciation of ""Talk to Her."" The two films share a lot of themes -- false identity and self-creation, the willful self-deception and fantasy of falling in love, the spiritualization of aesthetic beauty -- not to mention a hypnotic use of music, an indifferent attitude towards women, and a few actors I recognized.)Almodovar's genius in both ""Bad Education"" and ""Talk to Her"" is his ability to set the scene, stringing the audience along, lulling it into a sense of comprehension and security, and then suddenly turning the tables with a twist of such dizzying magnitude that the mind, reeling, forced to give up on trying to understand, must just relax and allow the movie to take over -- miraculously, all without leaving the audience feeling manipulated. In ""Bad Education,"" he takes this device to breathless, upper-atmospherical levels, for with each twist, the film takes on a new genre.It begins as a tender coming-of-age story, interspersed with boarding-school flashbacks reminiscent of such French fare as Louis Malle's ""Au revoir, les enfants"" and FranÃÂ§ois Truffaut's ""L'argent de pÃÂ´che,"" although I sensed a lot of Fellini in the mod outfits, feathery hairstyles, and picturesque bicycle-strewn streets. Probably the most romantic segment of the film, it alludes even to ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" (Henry Mancini's ""Moon River"" hasn't been employed so creatively since last year's ""Angels in America""). Indeed, the performances are so endearing, the cinematography so warm and luminous, that this segment of ""Bad Education"" could easily exist as its own self-contained movie. I was fully prepared to embrace it and love it as a sincere period romance.But without warning, the film turns itself upside down and becomes an exhilarating meta-commentary in the vein of Charlie Kaufman's ""Adaptation"" (complete with crocodiles). Romance turns to farce and tragedy to comedy as the self-consciously cinematic style gives way to the silliness of a movie-within-a-movie.Unlike ""Adaptation,"" though, ""Bad Education"" goes on, and in this way it retains its heart and soul. Further twists are introduced, and the movie metamorphoses into a mystery, a thriller, a dark rain-soaked noir -- by the end, I felt as though I had just lived through a hundred years of cinema history, all condensed into less than two rich, glorious hours.So what holds it all together? The answer is Gael Garcia Bernal. He is a true movie star -- divinely beautiful, dazzlingly charismatic, with that all-important aura of mystery -- and though he virtually plays five characters as his character transforms along with the film, his strikingly calm blue-green eyes and sensual mouth provide a steady center for the madness around him. Despite the rumors of his abusive treatment on set at the hands of Almodovar, Garcia Bernal has a dignity (without which ""Bad Education"" would collapse under the weight of its own intelligence) that no amount of makeup, wigs, dresses, induced anorexia, or fake Spanish lisping can mask.""Bad Education"" was one of the most intense movie-going experiences I've ever had, and if its future doesn't hold critical acclaim and recognition as a classic, then there's no justice in the world.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY3OTMyZmMtZmY2OC00MjRhLThkYmYtYzFiOGFhOTQ5NGNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcwOTQzOTYy._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The credits were funky, the heroic Elmer Bernstein score was sweeping, the dialogue was amusing and the plot was something every 12-year-old boy only wishes he could take part in.  After all, what could be more fun than taking your android companion on a simple mission to retrieve 3 female survivors from a destroyed outer space pleasure cruise ship who land on a planet nobody is supposed to go anywhere near?  I was game!As Wolfe, the man motivated to rescue the three maidens for some big time ""megacredits"", Peter Strauss is fantastically watchable.  I don't know what it is about him as an actor, but he does try to bring some sense and sensibility to a pretty generic role.  Joining this little adventure is Niki, played by a very young Molly Ringwald.  Sure, she's annoying and a pain-in-Wolfe's rear end, but who else could you see playing her from that time period?  One of the cast members of ""The Facts Of Life""?  Also included in the cast is Andrea Marcovicci (too bad her part wasn't a bit longer), Ernie Hudson (who always manages to bring some intensity to his roles whether in a good or ""not so good"" film) and Michael Ironside as Overdog (the opposite of ""Underdog""?), the baddie.Yes, the film consists of a whole lotta cheese; the dialogue borders on laughable (especially by the dwellers on the planet), the special effects don't quite live up to expectations and the plot revolves around a bunch of set pieces that don't seem to make for a consistent story.Still, you know what?  This movie holds a very special place in my heart. Let's face it, folks, they don't make them like this anymore.  There's no fart jokes, no nudity, no sex and very little language.  What's more, Peter Strauss gets some very funny moments!  Upon finally rescuing the three screaming women from Overdog, a frustrated Wolfe shouts at them ""Will you PLEASE shut up?

The film's strength, in my view, is how people tried their best to maintain their normal lives and customs as their world crumbled around them, both literally and figuratively.The young man playing the central character does a fine job of bringing Boorman's childhood to life.  The natural ability of children to adjust to change (but not without consequences) is brilliantly depicted.  The ""gang"" sequences were not only funny but also felt remarkably true, especially the collection of plundered booty and scrap war material.  It's just the type of mischief you'd expect from letting the boys run wild through this type of damage.Sarah Miles and Sammi Davis are excellent as the mother and older sister to the central character; their interaction shows the damage war does to relationships and moral values.  The highlight for me was the grandfather, however.  The gentleman stole every scene in which he appears.  The final scenes of the movie show his delight in his grandson in such a novel and moving way that it became almost the film's highlight.I worked with a man who lived in London during the war, when he would have been the same age as the boy in this story.

Peter and Richard Simpson, the Canada-based team responsible for Prom Night were the producers, marking their second joint venture into the kingdom of slash and explaining the healthy budget and strong casting decisions. It's no secret that it suffered a nightmare production that was riddled with problems, which began when lead actress Celine Lamez refused to play a full-frontal nude scene a fair way into the shoot. She was consequently fired and blacklisted from working in Canadian motion pictures for four years. Linda Thornson replaced her, but obviously all the parts that had already been filmed had to be re-shot with the replacement, costing more money and putting a dampener on the set's general atmosphere. After that, things just spiralled further downhill, resulting in various script changes and complaints from the financers that were unsatisfied with Ciupka's work as director. (That came as a big surprise when I found out; I thought he did a superb job!) A lot of scenes ended up on the cutting room floor, which explains the studio stills showing screen-shots that never appeared in the final print when it was finally released after being shelved for three years. I'm fairly sure that some of the conspicuous plot holes that can be found throughout the runtime are most definitely resolved on a roll of film that's stashed away somewhere in a Canadian office, waiting for someone to uncover and re-edit it into a 'director's cut'. Those sorts of on-set complications usually and quite understandably completely ruin most efforts that are unfortunate enough to be plagued by them. Just look at Steve Miner's Texas Rangers. As a filmmaker, Miner usually always manages to deliver the goods, but after one too many accidents involving careless horsemen and an uninspired crew, it reportedly created an atmosphere of ÃÂlaziness'. The film was first rumoured to be ÃÂunreleasable', before it slipped out silently some months later and bombed like a dysfunctional torpedo. Despite all that worked against it, Curtains is still one of my favourite genre-pieces from the early eighties. Ciupka directs with an exquisite style and confidence, and Paul Zaza's superb score creates a relentlessly foreboding environment that has rarely been matched to such a great effect. The story resolves around a mysterious director that is trying to produce a film, which he feels soulfully passionate towards. Jonathan Stryker (John Vernon)'s lover and lead actress, the well-respected Samantha Sherwood (Sam Eggar), bought him the rights to the movie, in return for the lead role. She was hoping to play the central character, Audra, whom is an infamously psychotic and eccentric woman. Like the best Method actors, Sherwood discovers that research is the essential key to performance, so she fakes insanity to have herself sectioned into an asylum, so that she can become emotionally closer to the persona that she wishes to portray. Stryker visits her constantly at first, but as time goes by, he becomes concerned that the actress is looking a little too convincing and perhaps she really has gone doolally.  So what does he decide to do, tell the doctor that it was all a farce and save the woman from impending delusion? Of course not, instead he just abandons her to rot with the rest of the whacko in the institute, and decides on a casting weekend at his remote New England mansion to find a new Audra! Hmmm, I'm betting that someone's going to have to pay dearly for that endeavour, don't you agree? The auditions consist of six actresses spending forty-eight hours away from civilization and undergoing vigorous dramatic examinations. Stryker himself sums the tests up perfectly, making himself sound like a military instructor, when he says, `The next two days will be unlike anything that you've ever seen before.' All the women have their own unique talents, and they're all attractive and unattached, proving that the crafty mogul has truly got his head screwed on correctly! When they all meet up over dinner for the first time, they discuss what lengths they'd travel in order to win - what would surely be - the role of their careers. The mood is decided when one budding thespian says that she'd ÃÂ...kill for the part'. The atmosphere gets all the more tense when Sherwood turns up unannounced and looks as if she's going to do just that! As sure as night becomes day, a masked killer makes an appearance and begins working his way through the cast-list one at a time, leading me to believe that he's auditioning for the crown of most creative slasher movie massacre inflictor! As is the thread with the multitude of genre entries from this point in the cycle, we have to decide whom we think is under that impressively creepy mask...Curtains certainly has more than its fair share of noteworthy moments. The awe-inspiring second killing, which can best be described as ÃÂskate and slash', ranks alongside The Prowler's ÃÂlate night swim' as two of the best from the genre's peak period. Christie (Lesleh Donaldson) sets out early in the morning, skates in hand, to practise her forte in the bright snow-laden woodland. She finds a fitting pool of ice and places her beat-box down, before treating us to a corny eighties love song and some visually credible skills that were indeed polished enough to rival those of acclaimed Olympic-twosome, Torvil and Dean! After a good couple of minutes watching her whiz around in circles, her performance is cut short, when the tape that she was listening too is mysteriously stopped. (It was a shame ÃÂcos that cheesy old ballad was actually quite catchy!) She looks over to where the stereo is placed, but sees no one, so heads over to get a closer look. On inspection she discovers a bizarre and spooky-looking doll buried under the snow beside the radio. As she cleans the frost away from its woe-be-tired face, we see the first shots of the mysterious killer as he begins skating towards the hapless female from a distance. Christie looks up to catch the assailant charging in her direction, which is shot in superb slo-mo and backed with some perfectly orchestrated work from Paul Zaza. She soon realises that this uninvited guest doesn't have her best intentions at heart, when he raises a scythe above his head and decapitates the dolly that she was clenching in her hands! After an apprehensive pursuit through the snow-coated trees and an unexpected jump-scare, lets just say, that the world has one less season ticket holder to the local ice rink! It truly is a brilliant experience watching the superbly deranged psychopath in the old-hag mask skate up in slow-framed shots, while the victim struggles to make sense of the situation. The tension was literally impeccable and Donaldson's decent performance as the petrified youngster made it all the more realistic, somehow. You'll be hard-pushed to find a more memorable sequence anywhere in slasher cinema. It's genuinely terrifying. The final chase was equally as suspenseful, utilising a superb use of lighting and claustrophobic trappings to create a fitting final to a competent offering. The prop-room location gives Ciupka a chance to shine as he makes the most of his previous experience, chucking in tonnes of striking moments. These include, flashing lights revealing the killer hiding in the back of a beaten up Mini, then disappearing when the camera returns, and the quick cuts through shots of strung up mannequins (and even a corpse), which are accompanied by the dieing screams of an unfortunate female. The patent credibility allows this to stand alone as privileged to possessing its own unique environment that separates it from the rest of its production-line counterparts. It's hard to describe, but Curtains has a matchless ambience that remains unparalleled, even today. It's hard to maintain whether it's down to the constant haunting shots of spacious corridors ending in spooky bright lights, the above-average editing or Zaza's terrific score, but one thing is for certain, it's definitely huge on atmosphere all the way through. Even the weaker points of the feature aren't all that bad, although admittedly, the artsy ballet scene and the rape sequence were overlong, somewhat random and fundamentally inexplicable.Another bonus is the good work from the cast, which is filled with actors that have more undiscovered talent than any kind of reputation or A-list credibility. John Vernon makes a competent - if a little theatrical lead, earning kudos for expelling any pleads for sympathy, while Eggar does a good job as the essential red herring (or is she?). But it's Lynne Griffin that really steals the show more than anyone else does. The dynamic little Canadian actress gets the chance to make up for her disappointingly brief role in Black Christmas, in which she spent most of her screen-time playing a corpse in the attic, with a bag over her head (no fair!) Here, she gives a fantastic portrayal, switching between emotions of anxiety, fear, insecurity and anger, even taking the time to include a stand up comedy routineÃÂseriously! I've already mentioned the tremendous use of music, but it's also worth noting the final piece that plays over the end credits. It's a beautifully composed melody that makes the most of the talented musicianship that was on offer.                The flaws are all mostly due to the problematic production. Even though we're unable to tell exactly how much the shoot was affected by the unfortunate occurrences, Ciupka having to use a pseudonym when the film was released proves that it certainly wasn't a rose garden. Some of the characters are far too under developed and one or two of them even remain nameless. It's impossible to pick your choice for surviving girl, because not one of the actresses was on screen long enough to display their individual characteristics, which also had a devastating affect on the mystery. It is a surprise when the killer is revealed, but to be honest, it could have been absolutely anybody, we're not offered any real clues or motives. What's really needed is a total rehash of the picture from the raw footage or the ÃÂdailies' - so to speak, so that we can get a true look at how it really should have been. Anchor Bay has worked wonders with movies like Maniac, Terror Train and Dawn of the Mummy, putting them to DVD with commentaries and decent extras. It'd be nice if they could raise similar interests to get this flick redeveloped with a commentary explaining exactly what's missing and why. Unfortunately, it's doubtful that anyone would bother funding such an exercise for an effort that wasn't all that successful in the first place. What we're left with, is a half-finished print that still manages to kick up one hell of a storm. Turn the lights down low and prepare to enjoy this decent offering with some of the most plausible directive decisions since Halloween first surfaced in 78. The evident brilliance easily outshines the few not so good moments and that one aforementioned murder alone, redeems the often budget-friendly asking price.

The CEO of a pharmaceutical company, a doctor, and a patient.","3","from 3 perspectives","Greetings again from the darkness. Actor Bryan Greenberg's (PRIME, 2005) first feature film as writer-director could have been subtitled, ""those who suffer vs those who profit."" Most of us can agree that businesses providing a desired product or service are entitled (not guaranteed) to turn a profit. And on a seemingly unrelated note, most of us can agree that those suffering from addiction deserve and need assistance in breaking the cycle that is destroying their life. The road where these two intersect is when drug companies produce an effective yet addictive product that is prescribed by doctors. The issue arises when profits soar due to the spread of addiction.The story focuses on the Opioid crisis, and evidently, it's a topic that filmmaker Greenberg feels strongly about. He serves up three perspectives so that we better grasp the full reach. Greenberg himself plays Michael, a restaurant owner in desperate need of a refill on his Oxycodone prescription. Ashley Madekwe (""Revenge"") plays Mary, a doctor whose practice has grown due to her willingness to write these prescriptions. Griffin Dunne (AFTER HOURS, 1985) and Ryan Eggold (""The Blacklist"") play CEO father Lawrence and ambitious son Jacob, who run one of the drug companies producing and marketing Oxy.The three-tiered approach works as we see Michael, divorced from Allison (Sophia Bush), is no longer attentive to his work or family, Mary has good intentions but carries the guilt of the drug's effect on her patients, and the heads of the drug company are facing an FDA hearing to determine their level of guilt and damages. It's a bad day for everyone. Perhaps Greenberg over-complicated the story unnecessarily with some additions like Mary's afternoon delight with the drug rep, Jacob's planned corporate coup over his dear old dad, and Michael's, umm, digestive issues at his son's basketball game. Of course, all of these elements are meant to show the progression of cause and effect when it comes to addictive drugs. One subplot that I couldn't make work was that of the doctor having financial troubles with patients lined up for the next prescription. It makes sense that she wants to escape the oxy world, but with her practice booming, why the financial woes?Familiar faces appear throughout, and include Dash Mihok (""Ray Donovan""), Jamie Chung (""The Gifted"", married to Greenberg), Josh Peck (THE WACKNESS), Yara Martinez (""True Detective""), Michaela Conlin (""Bones""), Hill Harper (""CSI:NY""), and Dascha Polanco (""Orange is the New Black""). The cycle of addictive drugs presents itself as causing money issues, trust issues, personal and marital issues, health issues from addiction, kids that can't count on parents, and political ramifications that lead to corruption. While it has the look and feel of one to stream, the film's message is quite clear and powerful.The film will be in theaters and on demand on January 26, 2024.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQ1OGM5NWItMjMzNi00YjEzLTlhOTMtMTJkNjcwNWRlNTdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjIyMjQ1NzY@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

That same depth is never reached again throughout the rest of the film. What we get are boring conversations like ""what do you do?"" ""where are you from?"" ""I study so and so,"" etc, as they walk through some of Paris' ugliest multi culturally wrecked streets, as if this French capital city is in a state of full blown AIDS itself. (Not far from the truth, mind you). There are also a few loose references to classical French authors to fill the intellectualism quota, as well as some nuggets of dubious political propaganda. The two characters do not connect on any level, other than sex; and one notices. The dialogue is unbearably banal and uninteresting.

"Vanity Fair","1999.0","PG-13","141.0","Drama","6.2","53.0","Mira Nair","Reese Witherspoon, Romola Garai, James Purefoy, Jonathan Rhys Meyers","23,514","Growing up poor in London, Becky Sharp defies her poverty-stricken background and ascends the social ladder alongside her best friend, Amelia Sedley.","133","A novel without a hero becomes a film without any bite","If Becky Sharp, Georgian England's conniving, calculating social climber, had a contemporary equivalent, it surely would be Tracy Flick, the deliciously ambitious high school student played delightfully by Reese Witherspoon in the acerbic comedy, ""Election"" (1999).Director Mira Nair has said what made Witherspoon the ideal Becky Sharp was the actress' ""American energy and sassiness."" Fair enough. But why did Nair then tame that energy and sass? We see none of it in Witherspoon's Becky. This isn't the feisty actress who proved she could play edgy and biting in ""Election"" and ""Freeway"" (1996). This is Elle Woods as Becky, thanks to Nair's misguided decision to turn Becky into an appealing feminist.I'm not averse to directors stamping their distinct styles on literary works, mixing film styles or modernizing old works. But you don't change the work's crucial essence. You don't transform Goneril and Regan into caring daughters, for instance.That's where Nair's take on William Makepeace Thackeray fails miserably.She and Oscar-winning screenwriter Julian Fellowes - the two other credited writers, Matthew Faulk and Mark Skeet, reportedly disowned the film alleging the shooting script bore no resemblance to their work - have stripped Becky of all her viciousness and cunning. They've declawed her in a ridiculous attempt to make her likable.In interviews, Nair and Witherspoon insist they didn't want to make a typical ""bonnet"" film. Fine. But you also shouldn't make a film that doesn't know what it wants to be and lacks emotional resonance. And that's what Nair's film is.It sparkles for about a half-hour or so as we see a young Becky, played pluckily by Angelica Mandy; then, the older Becky (Witherspoon) leaving school with her friend, Amelia (Romola Garai), and meeting, among others, Dobbin (Rhys Ifans) and George Osborne (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). Later, Becky becomes Sir Pitt Crawley's (Bob Hoskins) governess and meets her future husband Rawdon (James Purefoy) and Matilda (Eileen Atkins).But once Becky heads to London, the film screeches to a halt. With no one seemingly knowing what the emotional tone should be and the story's harshness and satiric edge excised, the film grinds at a snail's pace, the actors slowly sapping all the energy out of it. A scene between Becky and George at the piano should be tart, their words should sting. Instead, the two actors labor with the dialogue and make the moment as sharp as a dull razor.Adapting Thackeray's massive novel into a feature film was never going to be easy. But Nair gets more wrong than right. With the exception of the children, none of the characters age. Gabriel Byrne looks the same at the end of the film as he did in the beginning, which takes place 40 years earlier. Witherspoon, Garai, Hoskins, Ifans, Purefoy and Rhys-Meyers also show no hint of aging. And in an attempt to condense the story, important characters - Amelia and Dobbin, for instance - disappear for long periods and show up solely to wrap up subplots.The highlights are Declan Quinn's striking cinematography, performances by Hoskins and Atkins, the only two who seem to be having any fun, and a superbly restrained Ifans, playing convincingly against type.Much has been made about the Indian influence in Nair's story. There's nothing wrong with them being in the film. Thackeray was born in Calcutta and the colony's impact was evinced in Georgian English society. Not only do Nair's Indian touches make the film seem more vibrant, but the peacocks, parrots and Indian musicians, costumes and servants also make provocative statements about the exploitation of India and how the British Empire amassed its wealth. However, no matter how exotic it seems, Becky's dance just doesn't work and seems like nothing more than an imprudent attempt to add a foreign film style into this period piece.Witherspoon, whose English accent falters occasionally, works commendably, but ultimately remains unconvincing through no fault of her own, really. You don't take someone who quips, ""Revenge may be wicked, but it's perfectly natural,"" and turn her into a sweet, amiable victim. Witherspoon isn't even remotely as devious as Nair would want us to believe. It's unlikely another actress, say Kate Winslet or Kate Beckinsale, would have fared any better for she'd have worked with the same script and Nair's foolhardy direction, which includes inexplicably asking Geraldine McEwan to not so much speak her lines as to squeal them high-pitched, making the veteran actress' Lady Southdown needlessly irritating.This film remains so emotionally lackadaisical that when Becky finally breaks down before Rawdon, it seems more like a ""For Your Oscar-Consideration"" moment for Witherspoon than anything else. By softening Becky, making her more alluring than calculating, Nair destroyed the story's spirit. She and Fellowes also tacked on a ludicrous ending.As botched film adaptations of literary works go, ""Vanity Fair"" isn't nearly as execrable as Roland JoffÃÂ©'s ""The Scarlet Letter"" (1995). But I'm confounded as to how the skilled storyteller of ""Salaam Bombay!"" (1988) and ""Monsoon Wedding"" (2001) could have gone so horridly wrong.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4OTkwNDY2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIwMzAzMw@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Agent is killed during an operation, the secret agency recruits his twin brother (Chris Rock).","193","ClichÃÂ©d, undistinguished but still brainless fun","Hayes is a suave, distinguished spy with the CIA who is part of a set up to buy a stolen nuclear weapon and then capture those involved.  When he is killed mid-operation, his handler goes to the only man who can replace him, his twin brother.  However his brother Jake is a hustler in New York City and not spy material.  Oakes has nine days to get him ready to take over his brother's identity and take up the assignment.Despite the awful reviews, I still decided to give this film a go because I was in the mood for a dumb film that really didn't require me to think even once: this was that film!  The film deserved every bad review it got - the only thing you need to worry about is whether or not you can accept the massive weakness or not.  The plot is a real shambles and if you think about it logically then it all goes to hell.  The idea that this is a reasonable plot, even for this type of film, is absurd.  The script backs this up with dialogue that is fitting for a stupid comedy but not for the situations in the plot (`does it play dvd's?' or dialogue about Dr's Dre and Irving while trying to stall terrorists).  Some of it is funny, but to be honest, if you dislike Chris Rock then there will be practically nothing for you.The plot brings the bomb back to the US towards the end in an effort to inject tension and urgency into the action, but it doesn't really work. The action is reasonably slick but it isn't ever really exciting - only polished like a product.  The action, like everything else, is quite clichÃÂ©d and not distinctive enough to really stand out from the crowd of other action movies.  The gags about race are subtle but still quite broad in the style of Rock.  I didn't find it offensive, but I never really understand why films have to constantly perpetuate racial myths such as all black people listen to hip hop and like certain sports etc. Some of it is funny though.Rock is the main reason for this; as I said, if you like him then you should enjoy this as most of the comedy is driven by him (even if nothing is anywhere near the sharpness of his act).  He is not very funny but he helps the film have an overall comic tone that works pretty well  Hopkins is totally slumming it.  He manages an air of cool detachment but the material is way below him and his autopilot light is on the whole time.  Stomare is poor and none of the villains really bring genuine menace - Eastern European hoods and clichÃÂ©s that they are.  Beauvais is sexy - but that is all she is here for, to put on black underwear! Her character breezes in and breezes out with no real reason or consequence, plainly all she is here for is to have a bit of sexy black ass in there - something that Washington doesn't bring.Overall this is a slickly made film that is clichÃÂ©d, absurd, undistinguished and not as entertaining as it intends to be.  Despite the fact that the film is very average and not really one to stand out, it can be quite enjoyable if you are ready for that. If you can turn off your brain and lower your standards then this can be OK, however just don't expect it to be great no matter what you do.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MTA5MTcwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDMwNzI3._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

One day on the bus he spots Holly (Ksenia Solo), a pretty girl that he recognizes from high school. Seth is desperate to ask Holly out but he simply doesn't have the looks or skills to impress her and ends up getting shut down, after a few more failed attempts at asking Holly out Seth starts to becomes obsessed. Eventually Seth's obsession drives him to kidnap Holly, but things don't go exactly the way he planned. I'll refrain from saying more about the plot since one of the few things that this film has going for is that it puts an interesting spin on the whole ""Captive"" premise. The film starts off pretty dry, the set up is bland and none of the characters really caught my interest at all. I started becoming a little eager for Seth to just Kidnap Holly already because I just wasn't interested in watching him sulk around obsessing over her and stalking her. Once Seth Kidnaps Holly things do get slightly better, but not much. As I said before the film throws a little curve ball here that mixes things up a bit, it was definitely interesting but they just don't do a whole lot with it, the majority of the film is still just a run of the mill captive flick. There is a little bit of gore, but aside from that and the little twist there just wasn't that much content here. It was basically just enough to keep me from turning it off. Another thing that becomes clear right away with this film is that even though the cast features a lot of familiar faces, the acting is actually pretty sub par. Lots of mono toned deliveries and many lines that you can tell were supposed to be delivered with a lot of emotion but just come off forced. The majority of the actors featured in the film have given much better performances in previous works that they have been in, so it was weird to see them all just fall flat. It's definitely not the worst acting ever, but it does take away from the tone of the film and makes it a lot less captivating, since this is a pretty dialogue heavy film that was a pretty big blow.Despite the OK premise, this just wasn't a good film. It had some potential but overall it just fails to do anything worthwhile.4/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5NTE3MzUyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ2ODI0MDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Dowd his most personally significant role.  In a career that spanned decades and included such great works at It's a Wonderful Life and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, choosing Harvey's friend, Elwood, as his personal favorite says something about rather powerful about Mr. Stewart and Mr. Dowd.James Stewart was a down to earth, decent man whose personal life was as honorable as the lives of George Bailey and Jefferson Smith -  but he admired Elwood P. Dowd, an alcoholic dreamer with an invisible giant white rabbit as his best friend.  Not what you would expect of a man who piloted B-17's and led giant raids over Germany in WWII.Elwood's attraction for us is perhaps what attracted him so much to James Stewart.  Elwood is happy with himself and his life and even more importantly, he makes others happy with their lives.  That is the great magic of Elwood and Harvey:  they make others happy and they bring peace and a measure of contentment to almost everyone who know them.I have seen another version of Harvey with Art Carney and it was quite good, but lacked the sense of magic that is a benediction in this version of Harvey.  In the Carney version, you can see Harvey - he is a giant white rabbit - and seeing Harvey takes much of the magic away.  When you watch Jimmy Stewart, you never really know if Harvey is real or not.  You know that Elwood thinks he is real and you know that Elwood's family thinks Elwood is crazy.  After watching for a while, you don't really care if Harvey is real.  Elwood is real and it is his belief in Harvey and what Harvey represents to him that endows him with such sweet and gentle charm. Harvey is his rejection of the harshness and materialism of the world.Harvey is a charming, magical masterpiece of kindness and goodness that somehow never becomes maudlin.  Elwood and Harvey do not feel sorry for themselves and they most certainly do not expect you to feel sorry for them either.  If anything, Elwood feels sorry for the rest of the world and he does not understand how everyone can't see as clearly as he does.  For in his world,  we are all brothers who should love as generously and kindly as Mr. Stewart's Elwood P. Dowd.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg2YTFkNjgtM2ZkNS00MWVkLWIwMTEtZTgzMDM2MmUxNDE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It kind of avoid some of the same old trappings and if it didn't avoid then it found away to make them more fresh or just tackle them from a different angle.The script is amazing. I love the dialogue that Alan Ball writes it feels so bombastic and real. There is a flow that takes away the stiltedness of words on a screenplay.I really enjoyed the performances too. They were really heart wrenching at times and done with care. Even the more subtle ones really stand out against the more dramatic ones.I was also surprised what it was pretty funny in the beginning.

Cain territory, and, though we've been through it with Barbara Stanwyck and Fred McMurray and with Lana Turner and John Garfield, this effort by Carter and Ford deserves more prominence; its writing, direction and cinematography are all well above average.

Set in upstate New York in the summer of '69 the movie focuses on the choices and the resulting consequences made by a young woman who feels trapped in her role as wife and mother.  That setting with the Vietnam War, social unrest, Woodstock, and the manned moon landing is arguably one of the most interesting times of the 20th Century and woven seamlessly into the film.  The soundtrack with songs from the era fits perfectly and is great. The casting and performances were flawless.  After seeing the film, I can't imagine anyone else in the roles.  This was the first time I had seen Liev Schreiber who plays Marty, the husband, and Viggo Mortensen, the carefree lover.  Both were terrific.  Tovah Feldshuh, the perceptive earthy mother-in-law, and Anna Paquin, the rebellious daughter, were perfectly cast as well.  And Diana Lane as Pearl, the lead, plays her multifaceted role well.

Mind you, it's slim pickings for randy male guards in this particular women's jail, where the majority of the prisoners are rougher than a rusty bastard file, director Gianni Siragusa's budget clearly not stretching to the hiring of quality bimbos.Conchita (actually played by transsexual sexploitation star Ajita Wilson) is thrown into prison shortly after stashing a fortune in stolen jewels in a bank's safety deposit box. Naturally, she is desperate to escape and enjoy her newfound wealth, but with an angry crime boss keen to get his gems back, and a warden who rules her jail with an iron fist, things aren't going to be easy.Written by Sergio Garrone, who also penned Siragusa's other equally lamentable WIP film Hell Penitentiary, this crap-fest consists of a succession of distinctly unerotic soft-core couplings, punctuated by the cat-fights, shower scenes, and mild torture expected of the genre. It's incredibly repetitive and extremely boring to sit through, with the slim plot about the missing jewels and the daring escape doing very little to alleviate the tedium.

But ever since the Friedberg/Seltzer team has joined in the ""I can make a movie too"" bandwagon, we were begging the Waynes Brothers to come back. The last really funny spoof movies are the Scary Movie series, they were clever and in our faces about the clichÃÂ©s in horror movies. The past few years we have had a major thing with dance movies like: Save the Last Dance, Step Up, Stomp the Yard, You Got Served, Honey, etc. Leave it to the Wayanes Brothers to finally put this genre in it's over clichÃÂ©d and overused scripts in it's place. Unfortunately Dance Flick did not meet my expectations, it was one of those movies that used all the funny clips in the trailer. I can't even believe how many problems there was with this movie, wither it's the editing, acting, or direction, Dance Flick is a let down.Megan is a former dancer who goes to a new school where everyone can magically sing and dance. She meets some new friends like Tracy, Charity and Thomas who is in a street dance gang. When Thomas and Megan connect they must face their ""impossible"" dreams together. Trying to ""bring it"", they work together to bring the ultimate dance group together. They also must face the difficulty of having a inter-racial relationship, as black women and white men passing them by, they try to pretend their love isn't real. But will they put all aside to help Thomas and his crew win the five grand to pay back his sponsor? Well, if you've see the ""dance flicks"" of the past decade, you know how it goes.Now for some odd reason I did get a few laughs out of a stupid movie like Meet the Spartans, but that was because I kept my expectations low and knew what I was going into. With Dance Flick it was completely different, I was really excited because we have a really funny team working on the film. But they relied too much on the gross jokes, instead of getting a laugh from them, they keep pushing on the gross jokes too much on the audience and it just didn't work. The actors seemed to force their comedy too much as well where they were just not funny. The movie was also, like most spoof movies, was way too short as well, the stories didn't make sense and were just too random. I'm sorry to say that Dance Flick is just a bad movie, it has a couple giggles here and there, but the audience was silent throughout most of the film. I'd say to skip the movie, if you really want to see it, go for the rental.2/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0OTQzMDMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk3MzQwMg@@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

""Simple events of life happy or sad,/ Some sad strings from the train of forgetfulness,/ Not fraught with heavy descriptions,/ Not crowded with events,/ No advice, no philosophy/ Only the feeling that the story is not yet over/ Although there is no more to read..."" 'The Lunchbox' is a perfect example of a unique 'short story'. A little love story with some little events and pain... but at the end there is a new beginning. The story is about a lonely old widower and a young neglected house wife. They connected through a lunch box and some letters, and share some emotional thought and experience of there daily life with each other. They are totally stranger to each other, but love has found out it's own way to enter. There is a basic question about ""Love""... 'Is it possible to fall in love between two strangers'? ""The Lunchbox"" defines it brilliantly... 'Love has no definition and it never follows any rules. So there is a possibility to fall in love with somebody whom we never meet. People loves to fall in 'Love' again and again, it may be someone we know or don't know or whom we already loved with'. Irfan Khan, Nimrat Kaur and Nawazuddin Siddiqui are acted very well through out the movie. Direction of Ritesh Batra is just too much perfect.

It is a hugely entertaining movie--one of his best.  Sharp, hilarious, and poignant.  And anyone who can keep a dry eye for that ending must be a machine. This is the movie where Jeff Daniels really gets to strut his best comic stuff.  He's always been underrated in my opinion.  He's terrific at playing the ""Everyman,"" but in Allen's movie he has a duel role--the clueless movie hunk who leaps off the screen to be with Mia Farrow, and the frustrated actor who plays him.  Farrow is also good, back to playing mousey after her bold turn in Broadway Danny Rose. I really can't say enough about this.  I would rank it as his best film of the '80s.

The film was written and directed by MartÃÂ­n Deus.The movie stars Angelo Mutti Spinetta as Lorenzo, a shy, quiet young man who is chosen last for sports, but who is a classical guitarist and an avid reader.His life is changed by the arrival of Caito, portrayed by Lautaro RodrÃÂ­guez. Caito is tough, muscular, and well versed in life on the street. He's the exact opposite of Lorenzo, but they still become friends. Caito has been sent from his father's home in Buenos Aires to stay with Lorenzo's parents. He's had serious troubles, brought on by his impulsive behavior. He pushes limits every chance he can, and those chances often involve Lorenzo.Both actors are excellent. Director Deus deserves credit for knowing how to bring their talent to the screen.The film is subtle in the way it portrays the bonding of the young men. Actually, the entire movie has a subtlety about it. No one is a villain, no one sets impossible standards, and no violence occurs. It's a gentle film, but there's always a sense of foreboding about it. You'll have to watch it to learn what motivates Lorenzo, Caito, and Lorenzo's parents.We saw this film at Rochester's Little Theatre. It was shown at ImageOut, the excellent Rochester LGBT Festival. This was its New York State premiere. It will work well on the small screen. Right now this movie has an IMDb rating of 8.4, which is remarkably high. However, less than 100 people have rated it, so that number could change. That high rating reflects my own thoughts about the film. I hope the rating remains high, so more people will want to see it. It's worth finding and viewing. It will work well on the small screen. P.S. Watch for Mariana Anghileri in the unheralded supporting role of Lorenzo's mother. She's a great actor as well as being very beautiful.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODc4MjNhMmEtMTNlZC00YWQ2LTk4NTktMGQwMDllNzE0YmQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI5NjIyMw@@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

But there is one he hasn't played against, The Man, Lancey Howard, played by the great Edward G. Robinson. With the help of his friend Shooter they set up the big fight. While having a high suspense factor in the poker scenes, the non-poker ones might get a bit boring at times, especially in the love story between the Kid and his girlfriend Christian. But when it comes to playing this gets almost perfect. McQueen has the ideal poker face, and so has Robinson, and they both play their parts realistically and brilliantly. McQueen was said not to be a real actor, just a poser, they said he didn't act he only looked, but he proves it wrong here. His facial expressions are perfect, and he plays the young hotshot player convincingly.Needless to say the cast is the really stunning cast. Next to the afro-mentioned McQueen and Robinson, there's the always reliable Karl Malden, as Shooter. Malden has the most developed character in the picture, and he does a great job. And the women, oh my god, two stunning young ladies are here in all their glory. Ann-Margret plays the cheater, the femme fatal, the sexy beast, who's married to Shooter but wants the Kid. Surely one of the most attractive actresses of her time, actually all time, Ann is presented here in all her glory and beauty and sex appeal. Her seduction of McQueen early in the film, is incredibly sexy, and played brilliantly. They say Ann learned to act during Carnal Knowledge in '71. but that's not true, she already was a versatile and talented actress here. Watch her face during the cockfight scenes, or her cheating while doing a jigsaw puzzle, she acts naturally, and does a great job. And those tight dresses she wears with lots of cleavage are eye candy in its best form. One of the sexiest performances ever. Definitely shows you can be looking divine, and having acting talent at the same time.Tuesday Weld plays the good girl, the girl from the country, Christian, and while not as pretty as Ann, she's quite a looker too, and she's also a talented and natural actress. The supporting cast is rounded out by Joane Blondell, Rip Torn, Cab Calloway and Jack Weston, all great actors who all do a fine job. Music score by Lalo Schifrin is good too, and so is the title track sung by legendary Ray Charles.As for the often-mentioned, often-criticized last hand, it's Hollywood, only Hollywood, not a poker documentary. The film needs a strong climax, and gets it. Norman Jewison is a fine director, and especially the poker scenes and head-shots are well directed. Not much action, not much character development but it's not much of a problem. If only Peckinpah had directed, now that could have been something, Jewison is a great substitute, but I like the thought Peckinpah could have even improved it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTEzZmJjOTgtNWZlNC00MGQzLTgyOGUtNTRiZDY5NmUzYmQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzk3NTUwOQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

But takes an unexpected fascinating flight into a world of redemption, family, and hope..,"" and "" Little Wing succeeds on authenticity and powerful performances..""The work of journalist Susan Orlean has been adapted to the big screen a few times, most notably in 2002 by Charlie Kaufman for the Oscar-nominated rumination on the nature of writing itself, ""Adaptation."" But even the girl power surfing film ""Blue Crush,"" also from 2002, had a unique rough and tumble charm to it. I think I can say the same for ""Little Wing,"" the most recent film inspired by Orlean's singular journalism. While the script from John Gatins, who wrote ""Flight,"" is mostly decent (there is some laughable dialogue peppered throughout)The hype train was derailed on the premiere date of March 13th, however, by Marya E. Gates, a freelance film and culture writer based in Los Angeles and Chicago, who writes primarily about film reviews and had a different take: ""Dean Israelite's direction is so fussy, frenetic, and disjointed that it renders moot any charm the story may have once contained.""Throughout this review, I used her excellent film review skills and her various valid criticisms peppered throughout her review of the film about how the film director & executive producer Israelite's incoherent direction lead to main characters not being fully developed to help the audience connect with the performances' of the lead actors, and the supporting actors in the cast, as a result the audience will pull themselves into the storyline and connect on a emotional level with the actor's performances as the main characters as the story unfolds.Set in Portland, Oregon, the film stars Brooklynn Prince, channeling the look and vibe of an early Kelly Macdonald, as an angsty 13-year-old girl named Kaitlyn, who blames all her bad behavior at school on the ""emotional upheaval"" of parents' recent divorce. Kaitlyn lives with her detective mother Maddie (Kelly Reilly) and her brother Matt (Simon Kahn), who has mostly gone silent in the wake of his family's disintegration. Unable to afford the $100K mortgage on their house (yet somehow still affording to send her children to private school), Maddie has put the family home on the market. She also inexplicably allowed her co-worker to give Kaitlyn two young racing pigeons.The Florida Project actor, Brooklynn Prince is one of the many most harmonious parts in this coming-of-age saga about pigeons, which are two of the best parts about the movie.Kaitlyn is unimpressed with the birds until her best friend Adam (Che Tafari) tells her about a pigeon racing enthusiast named Jaan (Brian Cox) who has a bird named the Granger who is worth $125 grand. The two very young adults then decide to steal the bird and sell it to the Russian pigeon mafia. Then, of course, Jaan tracks them down and the whole gang decides to take on the mafia and get the bird back.There's a lovely metaphor in the film about pigeons and home, established at the very beginning with a quote by Orlean on how racing pigeons ""have a fixed, profound, and nearly incontrovertible sense of home."" Kaitlyn is the pigeon, yet the reason she loves her home so much is never really established. What memories does she have there? What is it she loves so much about this house other than she's lived there her whole life? At least Matt questions her saying, ""It was hard to grow up here sometimes.""Other than a love of Bikini Kill, the character of Kailtyn is never fully formed beyond generic angst, with an occasional hint at some suicidal ideation. In fact, most of the characters are blank slates. Maddie is a cop in Portland, a city that has been riddled with police direct & indirect violence against people of colour who are not white, yet that is never alluded to.Why Adam, a very young Black male living in a so called post-racial world, would offer to commit a crime under the influence of a little White girl Kaitlyn solely to maybe get to French kiss her is wholly unbelievable, which I frankly believe is racist and promotes racism (white supremacy), as a local & global system of government which promotes the ideas of mistreatment, subjugation and domination based on skin colour.Cox does his best to imbue some genuine pathos into the role of Jaan, in what could have been a nice companion performance to Nicolas Cage's poetic work in the far superior Portland-set beloved animal heist gone awry film ""Pig,"" but then he's saddled with the late-film revelation that he's dying of cancer, which elicits groans rather than any added empathy.All of this might have been shaped into something passable if it weren't for Israelite's incoherent direction. He hasn't shaken off the frenetic cartoon style that's en vogue for children's film (and which even then comes across as condescending towards young people). As Israelite attempts to blend comedy, action, and drama, Anne Nikitin's score continually shifts between three divergent musical styles with absolutely no cohesion to blend them all together. Smash edits and other unnecessarily showy techniques overpower the cast's performances. Like a lot of films today, ""Little Wing"" is shot in an extreme widescreen, yet Israelite and cinematographer Jeff Cutter never fill the frame with anything interesting.At one point Kaitlyn disrupts a classroom presentation to spout the words from Kathleen Hana's Le Tigre song ""Keep On Livin', repeating the lyrics ""This is your time, this is your life and/You gotta keep on (Keep on livin!)"" over and over. This should be a cathartic moment for the Kailtyn and the audience, yet the moment is undercut by Cutter's shoddy handheld camera and the treacly, over calibrated editing that tells the viewer how they should feel rather than just trusting Prince's performance to evoke their emotions.Worst of all is the way the pigeons are filmed. Pigeons are beautiful birds. Their plumage can sparkle, speckled with deep purple and grey and orange and teal hues. The Granger is described as having a white helmet head, and while the bird used does indeed fit that description, he never gets a close-up. Nor do Kaitlyn's new birds, Charlie Tickets and Juliet. During the film's final pigeon race scene, thousands of poorly CGI'd birds ""fly"" out into the dawn, surrounding Cox as he tips his hat to them.Cox deserves better. Prince deserves better. Tafari deserves better. Audiences deserve better. And, frankly, pigeons deserve better.On Paramount+ now.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJjNTNjOTktNjFkMS00MTQ5LTgyMmYtMzE4OGMxZGQxYTA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM1NjM2ODg1._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I felt terrible for Kristin in the night club scene, wearing a ridiculous dress and using her feminine wiles ( primo top dollar dancing to the unaware) to lure Cantana, a lesbian associate of Bison, into a bathroom. The pacing of this movie was dreadful, and we are hand-held for every scene, if Chun Li is walking on the screen she will undoubtedly inform us ""I was walking.."" ... REALLY? Really.

How is she a victim of circumstance? Am I supposed to feel Vega's threatening persona through five minutes of him getting the crap kicked out of him? Am I supposed to believe Bison is all evil when he continues to nurture his daughter? I think this movie was seriously edited so terribly, whatever good there was to salvage was lost on the cutting room floor. Whoever edited this needs to be bird kicked in the throat.

It's also an insult to the once-funny Steve Martin's past, and it's tragic he doesn't seem to realise it (which is almost unbelievable). Why? Because it's not funny, it's that simple. Had it not been for the legacy, it would simply be another not-funny-at-all mess that regretfully made some money for the schmucks that produced and wrote it (I guess people will go see it because of all the stars, which should be enough). But because of the legacy, many young viewers will have their experience of the real Pink Panther series biased and maybe spoiled for ever. It's like spitting on Peter Sellers' grave.

So I was looking forward to The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2, curious what the girls were up too in the story. The reason I like these movies so much is because they're very real; except for the traveling all around the world despite as if money was no issue, these being college girls mind you. But the story provides teenage girls who look like your average teenagers, their stories are very relatable if you are a girl, and we have comedy, romance, and drama, a typical chick flick, but thankfully these movies are enjoyable one's that don't push it. I felt like these girls are just so much fun and like I could know them in real life.Tibby has moved to New York, studying film and works at a movie store, but she has a bad pregnancy scare when her boyfriend's condom breaks. Thankfully it's a false alarm, but she is scared of her heart being broken once again. Lena goes to Greece for her Grandfather's funeral, she sees Kostos, but he is now married and is having a baby, so she takes an art class at home and starts dating the model that she is currently drawing. Carmen goes to Vermont to be in a drama club, expecting to work behind the scene, her leading man crush encourages her to audition and she gets a lead role causing some jealousy around the more experienced actors. Bridget goes to Turkey on an archaeological dig and finds out more about herself and goes home, but first she has to see the grandma who she thought didn't love her, it turns out she learns more about herself and her mother. But these girls have let their friendship go and must find a way to make the magic of the pants work once again.I would honestly recommend The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2, I really did enjoy the story and acting, along with the characters. I think The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 is a notch below the first film, but it still works. There are minor flaws here and there, but it's very easy to get past, I don't understand the rating of 6.0 here on IMDb, this is an honest and genuine film that I think a lot of people could enjoy. I think my favorite story this time was with Carmen once again, she's the character I can relate to most and she's very much the under dog of the story. But all the girls are a pleasure to watch on screen, they make you laugh and just have a great time with their journeys. This is a wonderful movie and I can't wait to see it again.7/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwNDYyMTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAwMjY2MQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Reluctant to dance, Erik runs away and encounters The Mighty Sven: a penguin who can fly! Mumble has no hope of competing with this charismatic new role model. But things get worse when the world is shaken by powerful forces. Erik learns of his father's ""guts and grit"" as Mumble brings together the penguin nations and all manner of fabulous creatures-from tiny Krill to giant Elephant Seals, to put things right. -- (C) Warner BrosI thought HAPPY FEET was pretty great. The film was foot-tapping fun and the dark turn it took in the third act, while unexpected, made it edgy and different for me. When a sequel was announced, I thought it seemed unnecessary. How far can you really stretch the premise of penguins who can dance and sing? Apparently, not that far. After viewing the sequel, it very much does seem unnecessary and wholly forgettable within ten minutes after you walk out of the theater, which is disappointing to say the least. Other than this, the main problem with HAPPY FEET 2 is that there aren't that many good musical numbers as compared to the first one. Most of them are pretty mediocre. However, there are probably around three that range from good to great, one of which uses the song ""Under Pressure,"" which is easily the best number in the entire film.Another problem I had was the dark tone of the film. It's a bit TOO dark, if you ask me. You see the younger penguin characters constantly be put in danger which made the film very uncomfortable to watch, and what these characters go through in the film would probably traumatize them for life. The film also suffers from messy storytelling. For example, the subplot with the shrimp characters (voiced by Matt Damon and Brad Pitt) seems to come from nowhere and is out of place from the rest of the film. It also doesn't help that the characters are so damn annoying. As for the 3D, it's put to good use in some places but, overall, it's really unnecessary. The one good thing I can say about the film is the look of it, which is very beautiful. I also liked Pink a lot, who gives a boost for all the musical numbers she sings in, along with Robin Williams, who has a few great jokes up his sleeves.Overall, HAPPY FEET 2 is a disappointment considering that I am a fan of the first film. Director George Miller doesn't seem to have his heart in the right place for this sequel compared to the first film. However, the film is slightly better then CARS 2 if that says anything.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdjZjUyMGYtM2FmOS00YjE1LTljMzQtNjgwYThlYzliNjQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcwOTQzOTYy._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It has a lot of moody atmosphere. Asia A., the lovely Eurobabe who is supposedly ogre-ish horror-meister Dario Argento's daughter (I, for one, won't believe it until I see the blood tests), spends most of the movie in various states of undress (unfortunately, so does Dafoe). Walken is great as always. But literally nothing happens. It's all atmosphere, eerie music, and occasional bursts of softcore groping. Neither Ferrara's visuals, Walken's acting presence, or Argento's tatooed nether regions can ultimately carry a film so totally devoid of conventional plot, suspense, or action. Not a bad film, just a disappointing one.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWZhZjlkMDQtZWIxMi00MmMzLTliOTQtZTYzOWQxZWRjZTc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This one was not written by King, but despite this lack of originality it is a fairly good sequel to an excellent movie.The mood is dark, just not as dark as the first film. We have Geoff and his veterinarian dad relocating to rural Maine (and the location of the Pet Sematary) after Geoff's mom is accidentally killed in front of him while shooting a movie. In their new small town, Geoff's dad opens up his own practice while Geoff has trouble adjusting to his surroundings. He befriends another outcast, Drew, who has an abusive stepfather named Gus to deal with at home. One night, out of meanness, Gus shoots and kills Drew's loyal dog Zowie. Drew then gets Geoff to help him bury Zowie in the notorious cemetery in hopes of bringing his dog back to life. It comes back, just different, mean and nasty, like it's mad about being resurrected and now hates everything and everyone (like all things brought back to life in the cemetery act). This starts off a chain of events that leads to the destruction of the lives of everyone involved (and some who aren't involved incidentally). Now its just a matter of who can survive the supernatural terror engulfing the town. The storyline is fun and the acting is good enough. The gore and other special effects are great.I can easily look past the bad points in a film and see the good in it. This film is like that for me. The film also posses qualities that make me automatically like it. It is an underdog film (meaning it's not very popular with most people on this site). It also has that early 90s disillusioned grunge youth generation feel to it. Some may see this quality as making the film darker, even mean-spirited, but I love that era and love its influence in movies. This is just the frosting on the ""cake"" for me, and overall the ""cake"" is worth a viewing on its own merits, even if it's just so you can judge for yourself.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDczNjdmYjEtN2QyYi00MTIxLTgyNmUtNzRkNzVlM2UyYTQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

They stop at Jane's friend Holly's place in Pittsburgh and take her with them west, making a long stop in Tucson. The three very different women become close friends.","50","A motion picture that celebrates the art of survival, the gift of laughter and the miracle of friendship.","'Boys on the side' is a very touching movie that looks essentially at what it means to be a woman, trapped inside a man's world. It also shows that friends really do stick together, through thick and thin. With the three leading ladies in roles that are really well written, here is a classy 'chick flick', that one guy really likes. It also looks into what it means to be sick, which I have been no stranger too, either....Three women sharing a car going west, team up in this winning celebration of camaraderie, caring and friendship which quickly becomes a family, in 'Boys on the Side'. One is a wisecracking club singer, one is a finicky real-estate agent and one is a free spirit. Each has secrets to reveal, strengths to impart and vital moments of self-discovery awaiting. Now is their time.What a fine cast for such a dramatic movie. The three main girls in 'Boys on the side' include the 'lesbo' Jane (Whoppi Goldberg), Robin (well acted by the talented Mary-Louise Parker), who is being helped to drive across America by Jane, and the fun loving and partly liberated Holly (Drew Barrymore). All these women are amazing in their roles.I love how Jane stands up for herself and her sexuality, in addition to the fine music she can sing. Robin is a girl hiding a big secret, but we are aware that her life has not been an easy ride, which seems ironic, because of what the movie shows. Then what Holly is enduring, is quite staggering, being involved with a brutal man, Nick (Billy Wirth), that no woman should have to put up with. It is Holly's great personality and character that turn these best friends into a very close-nit family. Her situation is not as easy as it seems either.While men are not talked about in a very good light in the film, we do see some men that are decent to these women. Robin admits to having a thing for barman, and on the road trip she meets up with Alex (James Remar) a caring barman, who is really hooked on Robin. The way their relationship goes is an interesting aspect of the movie. James had an interesting character in HBO's 'Sex and the city'. Holly, with such a bubbly personality meets a cop cutely named Abe Lincoln (Matthew McConaughey). He dearly loves Holly, wants her as his wife, so she can live a life that can be happy and trouble-free. I am interested in seeing McConaughey's latest film, titled 'How to lose a guy in 10 days'.The director of BOTS was Hebert Ross (from the brilliant 80's movie, Steel Magnolias). He is a very game sort of director, and does not shrug away from any of the important issues within the film. I love how he brought out the movie's main themes of sex and sexuality (gay and straight), the empowerment of women, friendship, sickness, humour and what it means to be a family.But the movie's story was also a highlight from where I viewed it. Written by Don Roos, it was very touching and emotional, but also holds a large amount of subtle, clever humour. The way he wrote the three main characters was terrific, with them all having very different situations for us to learn about. This I believe allows us to fall in love with each one of them. The use of quick flashbacks is another aspect that was well written into the screenplay by Roo's as were some of the lines in BOTS, which are unforgettable. Lines like when Holly asks Robin at the dinner table, `We're you?' in reference to her and Jane having a sexual relationship, the next few lines are great. The title of the film was well thought up, considering the line that Robin's mother says to her daughter, `You can't fight nature, God knows you women keep trying, treating your men like side dishes, stick a fork in when needed, just like men used to treat us.' That line is basically what the film is all about.Another great part to this film was its soundtrack. It was not only clever to incorporate it via one of the movie's characters, that of Jane, it makes the whole movie all the more compelling. Whoppi Goldberg and Mary Louise Parker sing a fine solo of the Roy Orbison classic, 'You got it'. Then for the movie to have another performer actually sing the song, I found to be just original, as some films would just throw in the old song, but not here. Another ironic part of the soundtrack is a song written and sung by known lesbian Melissa Etheridge, titled 'I take you with me'. I am sure that the powers behind this movie wanted such a performer, considering one of the main characters in the film was also gay.I watched this film, just a few weeks after seeing a movie that I am sure inspired the writer of the script, that being 'Thelma and Louise'. Parts of 'Boys on the side' has a similar feel to 'Thelma and Louise' - that of women on a road trip, trying to break free of men's hold on them. While a lot of the film is original, it has a very touching ending, to what can only be described as a very emotional movie. I also feel that director Herbert Ross, allows us to experience what each character is going through in life and does not shrug away from any issues that other movies might simply try and avoid. With a cleverly incorporated soundtrack, 'Boys on the side', is a movie that we can all learn from, to try and improve not only our friendships that we have, but how we live our lives in a world that can be cruel, harsh and unfair.CMRS gives 'Boys on the side': 4 (Very Good Film)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDlhZGNiNmItODQ4NS00OTk3LWI2MDctMDZmODFjN2NlODExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Then why is it so great?Southern California surfer-dude Shaun Brumbder is all about surfing and partying until one of his good friends dies in a surfing accident and Shaun begins to question the point of his life which is all surfing and partying. Then he finds a book that changes his life and he decides he wants to become a writer. The problem? He lives in the rich LA suburban community of Orange County, where people are more obsessed with pop culture and themselves than being happy and Shaun feels he needs to get out to go become a writer and study under his favorite author at Stanford University. (which is about 6 hours north of where he lives)Again, why is this great? First and foremost, we have the script. It's smart, but still wacky as a teen comedy needs to be. The characters aren't nitwits wander around aimlessly or purposely insult themselves by being complete morons. There's no pointless wandering for a car or bathing in urine. It knows what it is, a teen comedy, but it's smart enough to know it doesn't have to be grossly offensive or incredibly stupid to be funny. The story has a heart, and the wacky antics all support it.Next is the cast. Without the perfect cast this movie could've been a dud. The main character is played by Colin Hanks (son of Tom Hanks) in his first major starring role and he nails it. He plays the smart surfer-dude with a dream perfectly and he deals and reacts to his environment and the rest of the superb cast as he should. If you really watch you can find a little bit of his father in him, but mostly he is his own actor, and a good one at that. He's very natural playing a realistic character. His girlfriend is played by Schuyler Fisk (daughter of Sissy Spacek), and she's a very positive, caring California girl. Her character wasn't as strong as Hanks', but she was mainly meant to be more of his sidekick than counterpart. Jack Black was the reason I saw this movie in theaters, and he was as awesome as usual (up until recently, where's he has just been taking whatever is thrown at him seemingly) as the unmotivated stoner older brother Hanks' character Shaun doesn't want to be. He's the worst example in the world, and is ultimately part of Shaun's motivation to not become like him. Next are Catherine O'Hara and John Lithgow, who both have seemingly come into their prime closer to middle age. They play off of each other wonderfully as Shaun's selfish parents that live the rich LA life and feel like their son owes them something. Chevy Chase is great as the school principle even though the role is small, he gets a laugh or two as he is bound to do. The teacher Mr. Burke is played by Mike White who strangely hits home as a California high school teacher more into pop culture than teaching, and he also wrote the fantastic script. Also, he is just another character in the long line of people hold Shaun down. Leslie Mann and George Murdock have funny bit parts as Shaun's step-parents who are also completely out of touch with the world. Kevin Kline has a great bit part as the author who inspires Shaun to become a writer and tells him exactly what he wants to hear.After that, this is just quality film-making by good people. Jake Kasdan (son of Lawrence Kasdan) directed this and his style shines all the way through. I first became a fan of his after his work on the TV show Freaks and Geeks, which is rather similar to this movie in that it deals with the wackiness of teen life in a knowing way. The writer Mike White also wrote a few episodes of Freeks and Geeks, which if you haven't seen, I highly suggest you do as it just hit DVD. Kasdan knows where to put the laughs, but he also knows how to moderate them and not make it a wacky teen orgy fest like the American Pie movies which are motivated only by teen libidos rather than real ambitions. The movie has a good story, and it is well told. In the end, there is nothing groundbreaking in Orange County. It's a pretty straightforward teen movie with a realistic plot and great performances. With another American Pie-type cast with emphasis on the goofiness, this movie would've been a low-grade teen sex flick. Instead we have a real story about ambition and teen life with a few falls off of roofs and vases falling on heads. 8/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIzYjJmNzQtNDc5YS00ZWJhLWI3NzItODgzNWRlNmQ0NmRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Nicole Kidman plays Isabella a real witch who wants to leave that behind to be like a mortal. She is cast in the roll of Samantha in a remake of the TV show. It is goofy and silly and nonsensical in places but SO WAS THE TV SHOW! Shirley MC is great as the actress who was a grand actress in past, but placed into a sitcom that doesn't really showcase her talent. DO NOT expect anything complicated from this.I enjoyed it for what it is. It's light fun. MY main criteria for liking a movie is do I think I got my money's worth and was I anxious for it to end. YES and NO.MANY of the performances are great. At times Nicole looks JUST LIKE Liz Montgomery and there are plenty of still of Liz and video of her to compare during this film. Michael Caine was excellent and Steve Carell is SPOT ON as Uncle Arthur. I mean SPOT ON! I grew up watching this and was anxious to see if they harmed it's memory. They did not.

Now, I love the Truman Show too, very much, and I'll admit that I was was very uninterested in ever seeing a copy-cat version of it. It was until just a few weeks ago that I actually watched Edtv (even with the expectation that I would most likely not like it too much) and I must say I was pleasantly surprised!Not only was Edtv funny and entertaining, but it was nearly nothing at all like the Truman Show. I mean, the ONLY similarity is the idea of a live TV show about an ""ordinary"" guy. But Truman didn't even know he was on TV. He was just living what he thought was an ordinary life. All the cameras and microphones were completely hidden and he lived in a town that was entirely fabricated from his wife and life-long best friend, to the rain and even the sun. His is a story of a man searching for an escape from his everyday life, which little by little he is realizing may not be what it seems. Ed on the other hand was a nobody who was chosen to have a camera crew actually follow him around all day while he went on about his life. His life, and in turn the show, became more about instant celebrity as viewers became enchanted in watching this loser become a mega-star over night. People flocked around him just as much to meet him as to be on TV themselves and he endured some major struggles in keeping his life and relationships normal, which was impossible with his celebrity status and on-camera life.Both movies had a theme of America's fixation with TV, and more specifically Reality TV, but have different plots and overall themes altogether. I think Edtv was a very enjoyable movie and Mathew McConaughey and Jenna Elfman delivered fantastic performances. Not to mention the mind boggling, and I think underrated, job of editing such an enormous amount of footage. Considering that while the film cameras were rolling, the video cameras were rolling too, and just about all of the video footage you see was actually shot when you see it being shot, I think that Ron Howard did a great job of keeping track of it all and actually making it work. So when someone says, ""Well, it was no Truman Show"" they are absolutely right. I  think it is a great movie that stands on it's own and should stand proud.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjBhNjc1NjktZTg4OS00YmUyLWI4YjAtNGIxZGM4ZTdkNmZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Cabin boy stays true to all that is Elliot from beginning to end. It doesn't change its mind halfway through, and is too unassuming to attempt to deliver any heartwarming morally relevant conclusion. Chris Elliot's antihero is so lovably hate able that you feel the desire to both punch him in the face, and gently rock him to sleep in a comfy blanket.

It's made very much in the style of the B movies of the 50s and 60s except for the R rating. The R rating comes from several scenes of topless women and some sexual activity. The star of the film is Traci Lords in her first role in a non-porno film. It is also supposedly the last time she appears topless in any film. I'm sure this is one of the big attractions of the movie to a lot of viewers. She did surprise me though by her acting. It really wasn't bad. There are several scenes that were put in the film of other topless, big breasted actresses. These scenes weren't really necessary to the plot but I doubt that many of the male viewers will voice an objection to them. At the beginning of the film while showing the opening credits, there are a lot of exciting scenes shown quickly. These are not in the movie. Don't expect to see them again. Although this is not made clear or pointed out, they are from other films. It still is an interesting and fun movie and has some pretty good scenes of it's own. The film has plenty of mistakes and bloopers to look for that were left in due to the low budget. I saw this on a DVD that also had a version with commentary going through the film with you. I found it very interesting and recommend that you watch this commentary version after watching the movie. 'Not of This Earth' is a fun movie that combines some light comedy, horror and sci-fi. The movie is not meant to be taken too seriously. It's best viewed by a non critical eye with the intent of just having a good time. This can be a really enjoyable and fun modern B movie if watched in the right frame of mind.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGRkYTJkOTMtNjJjOS00ZmI1LTg5MWYtNWIxYmViYzE1NTI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The Taiwanese identity is revealed to be a sense of perpetual exile.Edward Yang's own father fled from Shanghai.  Artifacts from other countries have great  impact in this film, the use of Japanese samurai swords which are ultimately used as murder weapons, Russian novels are read by teenagers and understood as `swordsmen' novels, a family's observation that the Chinese fought the Japanese for 20 years only to then live in Japanese houses listening to Japanese music, an old tape recorder that has been left behind by the WWII American forces is used to adapt American lyrics and American rock n roll music for the Chinese, the film features American doo-wop music, first love, cigarettes, casual dress, the influence of Hollywood motion picture magazines and movies, the voice of John Wayne can be heard in one of the movie theaters, the title of the film comes from the Elvis Presley song,  `Are You Lonesome Tonight,'  a comment on the dark cloud hanging over everyone's heads, hardly a brighter, summer day.The film took 5 years in preparation, and although completed in 1991, it has never found a distributor, it involves a cast of over 100 speaking parts, largely non-professional teen-age actors, 92 different sets, it takes place in the poorer Tapei district in 1961,  using the filmmaker's own memories of his adolescence, shot at his high school, inspired by a true incident of a 14 year old boy murdering a 13 year old girl, the first juvenile murder case in Taiwan's history, the film opens and closes with an old, broken down radio broadcasting the lists of graduating students.  In this context of a repressive, militaristic government, family chaos, the constant threat of gang fights, the need for a good education, the idea that hard work can bring success, is seen as paramount.For all those `Yi Yi'  fans who don't understand the complexity of this film, let me just remind you about the title,  `A Brighter, Summer Day,' this is a film for which those words have no meaning, and unlike  `Yi Yi,' which had the charming optimism of Yang-Yang, an as yet undeveloped child who has a future,  `Yi Yi `  was much more a  `perfect'  film, everything was neatly examined and explained, there's a perfect symmetry, on whole it's balanced, it feels like a complete experience, but  `A Brighter Summer Day' offers no such peace of mind, it's a raw emotional roller coaster where the last hour or so is filled with such complete anguish and despair, nearly all the family members have their singular moments where they are the focus of the pain and anguish, the understated personal horrors can leave one breathless.  Most of the world's viewing audience of films have been spared this kind of personal degradation, and therefore have no personal reference points to connect with such despair, but Yang, to his credit, spares no one. The film's greatness lies in it's complete lack of artifice, it's meticulously chosen shot selection, brilliant imagery mixed with an equally brilliant narrative, a devastating portrait of children on the precipice of darkness, one of the more complex human examinations of the after-effects of a subjugated nation, which is still, at heart, a police state, yet there is a breaking out from the bonds of repression by rebellious teen-age kids who have affectations of violence and a love of Elvis, freedom, and rock n roll.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGUwNTg3ODUtMTU5Zi00MDdiLWE0ZmQtMzRhMmZkMWJkNjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc3MjQzNTI@._V1_UY209_CR8,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I found this very surprising as I expected Nicholson to flood the screen, as he so often does with such little difficulty.However, the emotion between Huston and Nicholson in the latter half of the film during the coffee shop scene is so powerful to watch. Huston is such a wonderful actress, and Nicholson shows some emotional depth that I haven't seen before, or rather, not felt with his performance before.The story is written and planned extremely well, with tension rising slowly and almost imperceptibly, until the final day.

My view as a naval officer during a scenic tour of the Mekong near the Cambodian border and the Vietnamese city of Chau Phu, permitted me to be a witness to many, many occasions involving the wholesale abuse of humans by humans.  The strain on mind, body and soul takes years (if ever) to repair and this film captures it.  There are brief glimpses of this agony in some of the other films mentioned here in the reviews, e.g., Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket and Platoon.  Each of these films have merit but are deeply flawed.  Apocalypse Now is steeped in moral allegory to the expense of an accurate portrayal of the war; Full Metal Jacket is only 2/3 completed; Platoon becomes a Levi-Straussian moral tale with an arch villain and virtuous hero-- the latter heinously slain by the former with revenge exacted by the weary sojourner on the odyssey.  OK.  What do we have here with Hamburger Hill?  A story? Heroic acts?  Action?  Not really.  What we have is the horror and insanity of war.  The film ends on the same pointless note as it began.

Most group it in within the ""cop/buddy"" genre and cheesy sci-fi. But ""Alien Nation"" is much more than that. In fact, it was way ahead of it's time.I saw this movie in a dimly-lit, run-down Detroit-area theater at the age 14, an afternoon in the fall of 1988. I recall how the ""atmosphere"" of the movie matched that of the run-down theater I was sitting in. At 14, and with the title of ""Alien Nation"", a young kid like myself wanted to see weird alien creatures and lots of action. At the time, I was disappointed. This movie is about story, not action or weird aliens. Although I didn't really understand nor enjoy the movie at the time, it always stuck with me for some reason. So, nearly 18 years after seeing it on the silver screen, I re-watched it at home and was amazed by the depth of the story and the grittiness of the background. It was little wonder why I didn't like it at 14, but loved it at 32.This story is really about race and immigration, with the hated race being alien immigrants. It shows how hatred and ignorance over race can transform one's personality, like the lead character played by James Caan.Alien Nation asks questions about ourselves as humans. How would we react if aliens landed on Earth and announced they were escaping a brutal planet full of slavery and have immigrated to Earth? Would we accept them as our own, or would we force them to become outcasts? Would we allow an ""Affirmative Action"" scenario in regards to Aliens and Alien rights? Would we offer them high-paying jobs and/or top-notch education, depriving humans of those same jobs and quality education in exchange? To me, Alien Nation is one of the more possible (and perhaps likely) scenarios. Aliens delegated to run-down areas of big cities. Token jobs occasionally handed out because it's forced by the Government to do so. And a general disgust towards Aliens amongst the human population. In that regard, this movie was way ahead of the curve.Great movie. 9 out of 10 stars. Recommended for those over 25, perhaps those with a higher intellect than most. Not recommended for someone looking for a ""Men In Black"" type of Alien movie. Not your typical Hollywood blockbuster filled with Aliens, that's for sure.IMDb ROCKS!JD","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODkwNmNlY2YtY2ZiMS00YjRjLWE5YWEtNjhjMjI1YTY1ZGQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

After Harry's body is found in the woods, several locals must determine not only how and why he was killed but what to do with the body.","176","Cinema's Best Shaggy Dog Story","With all humor, you either get the ""joke"" or you don't. If you don't, no amount of explaining can change your mind. If you do, the details are endlessly enjoyable.Part of the joke that's ""The Trouble With Harry"" is that ""nothing happens."" Hitchcock's ""anti-Hitchcock"" film defies expectations for action, shock, mayhem, suspense, spectacular climaxes on national monuments, etc. Instead, it's a New England cross-stitch of lovingly detailed writing, acting, photography, directing and editing.Saul Steinberg's title illustration tells you exactly what you're in for. One long pan of a child's drawing of birds and trees . . . ending with a corpse stretched out on the ground as ""Directed by Alfred Hitchcock"" briefly appears.So meticulously is ""The Trouble With Harry"" conceived, the only two images in the title art that are NOT trees, plants or birds are a house with a rocking chair on its porch and that corpse. The film literally plays in reverse of the title sequence -- from little Arnie's (Jerry Mathers, pre-Beaver. The boy who drew the titles?) discovery of the corpse, back to the home with the rocking chair, as Hitchcock's final ""joke"" puts the audience safely to bed. A double bed, in this case.What's the film about? Oh, Great Big Themes like Life and Death, Youth and Age, Love and Hate, Guilt and Innocence, Truth and Lies, Art and Pragmatism -- packaged with deceptive simplicity.The ""hero,"" Sam Marlowe (John Forsythe), is an artist. The man the ""child"" who drew the titles (Arnie, or someone like him) might have become. His name is an amalgamation of two of hard-boiled fiction's greatest detectives: Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe. Indeed, Sam Marlowe functions here as a ""sort of"" detective. But enough of pointing out the detailed construction of this script and film: repeated viewings yield far greater pleasures.""Introducing Shirley MacLaine"" in her first screen role threw that enduring actress into an astounding mix of old pros: Edmund Gwenn, Mildred Dunnock, Mildred Natwick and Forsythe. That MacLaine held the screen then, and still does 50 years later (name another major actor who can say that), validates Hitchcock's astute casting.In fact, TTWH is a tribute to cinematic ""acting"" as much as anything else. These are among the finest performances ever captured of these terrific actors. Since there are none of the expected ""spectacular"" Hitchcock sequences, nor his nail-biting tension, all that's left is for the actors to fully inhabit their characters.That they do with brilliance, efficiency and breathtaking comic timing. No pratfalls here. Just nuances.Edmund Gwenn and Mildred Natwick are the real stars. Had Hitchcock said so, the film would never have been produced. Their scenes (they receive as much if not more screen time together than Forsythe and MacLaine) are possibly the most delightful (and yes, romantically and sexually tense) ever filmed of courtship in middle-and-old age. Perfectly realized in every intonation and gesture. Occasionally laugh-out-loud funny.Theirs is paralleled by the courtship of the younger ""stars,"" Forsythe and MacLaine. ""Love"" at both ends of life, young and old, and love's wonderful humor and mysterious redemption, even in the face of death -- that inconvenient corpse on the hill.Perhaps the most surprising and powerful undertow in ""The Trouble With Harry"" (one hesitates to name it because it's handled so delicately) is Sex.It is only barely present in the lines given the characters, but the subtext is always there. Occasionally, it boils over into an infinitely subtle burlesque, as in the exchange between Gwenn and Forsythe about crossing Miss Gravely's (get that name?) ""threshold"" for the first time.The look in Gwenn's eyes and the repressed joy and romantic hope in his face -- even at his stage of life -- is bliss.The coffee cup and saucer ""for a man's fingers;"" the ribbon for Miss Gravely's newly-cut hair (Wiggy cuts it in the general store -- Mildred Dunnock in another unbelievably subtle performance -- muttering, ""Well, I guess it will grow back.""); Arnie's dead rabbit and live frog; the constantly shifting implications of guilt in the death of ""Harry"" up there on the hill; the characters' struggles to regain innocence by ""doing the right thing""; the closet door that swings open for no apparent reason (never explained); the characters' revelations of the truths about themselves; their wishes granted through Sam's ""negotiations"" with the millionaire art collector from the ""city"" -- ALL portrayed within the conservative but ultimately flexible confines of their New England repression and stoicism (yes, the film is also a satiric comment on '50s morality) -- these details and more finally yield a rich tapestry of our common humanity, observed at a particular time and place, through specific people caught in an absurd yet utterly plausible circumstance.Nothing happens? Only somebody who doesn't know how to look and listen -- REALLY observe, like an artist / creator -- could reach that conclusion about ""The Trouble With Harry."" Only a genius, like Hitchcock, would have the audacity to pull the rug out from under his audience's expectations at the height of his career by offering a profoundly subtle morality play in the guise of a slightly macabre Hallmark Card.When the final ""revelation"" arrives, in the last line that takes us home to the marital bed where love culminates and all human life begins -- yours and mine -- and draws from us a happy smile of recognition, so Hitchcock's greatest secret is revealed, more blatantly in this than any of his films.""Life and death -- and all of it in between -- are a joke! Don't you get it?"" It's there in all his pictures. Nowhere more lovingly and less showily presented than in ""The Trouble With Harry."" Thank you, Hitch.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjlkYmE2YzYtYzIzMC00ODFhLTljNjYtZjA4YWY2ZGM5NTYwL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Furthermore had Lore and Liesel been raped by the rampaging Russkies, I wouldn't have given a damn. Why not? Just read the history of what the haughty German forces did to Russians, both sexes, from 6/22/41 to the point when they were forced out of the USSR.This film was designed to engender sympathy for Germans who, once upon a time, gave the right handed ""Hitler Gruess,"" yelled ""Sieg Heil."" Sorry but I don't buy into such trash.In my case, every bomb that fell on Nazi Germany was deserved, including the incendiary attacks. This movie showed a big sister leading her sister and two brothers across shattered Germany in order to reach ""Omi's Haus"" ,grandma's house, and safety. ""Sprinkled"" into this scenario we see photos of the extermination camp slaughtered to which a German reply in this film was that the dead bodies were actors, paid to pose by ""Die Amerikaner."" I have news for you--that kind of sadistic speech was the RULE, not the exception.This film simply infuriated me because of its attempt at manipulating the feelings of viewers who were and are citizens of freedom-loving nations hell bent on destroying Nazism. What better way of bringing out the tears of Americans than by seeing how four Nazi indoctrinated kids suffered. But big sister Hannelore,even though helped by someone she was taught to hate by her sadistic mentally ill Nazi-loving parents was still brutally anti-Semitic despite the assistance.I mentioned her parents. ""Nice people."" They were war criminals wanted by Allied forces. Hannelore's ""Vati und Mutti"" were no ""run of the mill"" Nazis.Instead they were involved in a camp set up to gas to death innocent helpless people whom Hannelore calls ""parasites."" That's how twisted her mind became. Good God almighty, all this murder began in a highly cultured Deutschland. Impossible to believe but when a mentally ill hatemonger seizes power even in a cultured society, we get thousands of Auschwitzes.""Lore"" parents were SS. It stands for ""Schutzstaffel,"" Hitler's elite murderers. The Chief of the SS was Heinrich Himmler closely assisted by a rotten dog named Reinhard Heydrich who eventually was assassinated by Czech patriots. It was these two who thought up ""The Final Solution to the Jewish Problem,"" a euphemism for genocide. Lore's parents were advocates of such barbarity therefore in our Judeo-Christian society,why should any American show sympathy for teen and pre-teen brainwashed Nazis?At the end of the war, Stalin ordered his troops to shoot anyone, male or female having any SS identification. The Russkies were blasting away until Roosevelt and Churchill intervened to stop the executions. This movie is so infuriating, you'd wish that the Russians would have shot all four kids plus their abominable parents. It would have reduced the length of the picture to five minutes, eat the popcorn and leave.The acting? Saskia Rosendahl a.k.a. Hannelore a.k.a Lore was quite good.If she ever learns English, she has the potential of becoming another Jennifer Lawrence. Regarding the acting of the others in this ultra-slow moving, boring and infuriating film, I couldn't care less. All I know is that it gave me a chance to bone up on my German and to bless the memories of all our guys who paid the ultimate price for ridding the world of the most hideous philosophy in world history and my deepest prayers for the souls of the six million Jews and 6 million Gentiles murdered by the likes of Lore's parents.Finally, I feel compelled to say that if ""Lore"" is still in any American theater in 2 weeks, it'll be a miracle. After all copies of it are out of circulation, all screens should be sanitized with Lysol.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA0MzFhZWEtZmM4NC00NGQzLWJhNTctZGIxNTVmMTJjMTZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Sadly it's a absolute mess and they tried to cram so much into the movie that it's hard to keep track sometimes. The movie lacks depth and characters fight just to reconcile 1 minute later. The movie jumps from scene to scene and every moment of depth conflict or drama is resolved within a max of 3 minutes.

I do understand the negativity, and it all boils down to amateur-quality filmmaking. Experienced director Catherine Hardwicke did a lousy job with this film in so many aspects. It felt like I was watching a B film by a newb amateur director that was made for TV. Hardwicke didn't bring out the best atmosphere in many scenes, nor the urgency or tension where it was required, and she surely failed in directing her cast effectively to bring out the best in her lead actors, but thankfully, they still managed to carry the entire film on their backs. A better director could've made this film stand out from all the rest.Fairly-newb writer Mark Bacci didn't reinvent the wheel, but still managed to create a heart-warming and gut-wrenching screenplay about family dynamics. The pacing was a little slow, but the 100 min runtime flies by with the easy to follow narrative and the engaging performances. You will catch yourself cheering, smiling, even some laughs, and some tears will be shed along the way. It's a great story, and it was told well.Beckinsale and Cox, as well as Convery as the young Ezra give outstanding and convincing performances with great chemistry between them. For that matter, all casting and performances were exceptional. Everyone knows Cox is an amazing actor especially from the Succession series, but Beckinsale is the one that really shines in this film because she actually has a role that allows her to show her full range - which impressed me a lot, an not just slicing and dicing vampires as she's know for in the Underworld franchise.This is by far one of my favorite films this year, it's just too bad a better director wasn't tasked to bring out what this film could've been. It's certainly one of the better films that has heart and soul in it that I've seen in a very long time, especially one that isn't beefed up by Hollywood shoe-shine. It's a must-see from me, and I'll for sure be watching this one again with family and friends. Hopefully K-Beck gets some nominations for her compelling performance. It's a well deserved 9/10 from me.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmIwNTYzN2UtZTQ5YS00NmM2LWE1ZDQtNmY3YzExM2U5MDE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDc5ODIzMw@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Even I saw the reveal at the end coming way-off (I rarely do), but I still really enjoyed this film.I thought it was very well plotted and paced; Vin Diesel played it gruff, but mostly low-key (no huge sobbing moments, or tearful walks on the beach, which was refreshing). His character, along with that of his friend, were fleshed out into more-rounded human beings than the usual action hero & sidekick. The enemies were straight out of 'the Big Book Of Drug Dealers and Cartel lackeys', but Timothy Oliphant was amusing and well played, as ever (also a great turn in The Good Girl).And I found the violence viscerally satisfying & gritty, without being seriously glorified, or venturing (too far) into Bad Boys style Hollywood explosions, helicopter gunships, LA car chases etc.Most surprising of all (to me) is that Vin agreed to grow his hair out a little - as you would in an extended hospital stay - and roughen up his otherwise clean shaven / macho male model looks. Wandering around with the goatee, he reminded me more of the guy out of Cypress Hill.Kudos also goes to the ending. It could have finished two scenes earlier than it did, but the tying up of loose ends wasn't done in an overly sentimental or triumphant way, which was similarly refreshing.Good screenplay, good acting (in a pretty standard film like this), and mostly avoiding the really obvious clichÃÂ©s of plot & character. I really enjoyed it. On the scale of revenge movies - it's not as good as Mel Gibson's remake of Payback, or The Rock in the remake of Walking Tall. But it would hold its own alongside them in a collector's box set.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4NzEwNjk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTEzNTk5._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

PERIOD.","***1/2 out of (****)Eisener's exploitative 80's grindhouse throwback, ""Hobo with a Shotgun"", showcasing its brutality shamelessly, is easily the best grindhouse film to ever grace the silver screen. ""Grindhouse"", ""Machete"", and ""Drive Angry 3D"" are all strong staples to the beloved subgenre, but ""Hobo"" is where its at. It's bigger, louder, and prouder. In all honesty, this is one of the goriest films I've seen in a while, and it takes a lot for me to say that because even the goriest Saw film doesn't fulfill my bloody craving. The best part about ""Hobo"" is not only doesn't it play it safe, but there's so much meaning, and depth underneath it, and is executed so strongly that the message never becomes lost or preachy. ""Hobo"" revolves around well... a hobo. An anonymous one at that who witnesses the catastrophes of the city, and decides to fight back. First of all, the plot is just ingenious. A hobo who's tired of getting picked on and besmirched by the townspeople decides to take a stand. Not only is it a badass story, but can't we all relate to the plot? Haven't we all been pushed around too long, and just wanted to do something. To be something truly special. Also, while the deaths are pretty sick, there's more meat on these bones. The film relies on what a film should rely on. Its characters. The relationship between Abby and the hobo is a strong one. I actually cared about these two. What does it say if a film of the title ""Hobo with a Shotgun"" has more character development than 95% of the garbage being released today? To put the icing on the cake, the production values are sweet. This film has a superb nostalgic look, and it's one of the most colorful and vibrant movies projected on screen. But why are we here? For the deaths! And boy, do they not disappoint. Eating glass, decapitating heads, and shots to the head are not even the goriest segments. Actually, they're the tamest. Not only that but almost every five minutes there's blood. Whether a dead body in a shot, random blood, or a kill occurring. This is just a huge blood bath. And a great one at that.Also, what I loved about this movie is the lack of gratuitous nudity. I hate how almost every grindhouse flick has to have the need to throw in random boobs or sex in the film. I know it's part of the titillation, but it's rather absurd, and feels out of context. ""Hobo"" had one scene exposing those jugs, and it actually fit the mood because of its humor. However, it was just THAT scene and wasn't littered throughout the movie.Ignore those reviewers saying they were ""disappointed"" because it wasn't ""what they were expecting"". If you're expecting a good time, dammit, you're going to get one. Two strong leads, heaps and heaps of blood, a slick story, and some solid production values. You're going to tell me that doesn't even get you excited in the slightest? ""Hobo with a shotgun"" might just be the best movie I'll see this year. The others have just not delivered on what they promised. How sad is it to see a movie with this title can actually be the best movie of the year, when probably half of the Oscar choices will be pretentious dribble. Don't even think about seeing this film.

It's highly imaginative, creative and clever.  It's just plain fun and in my opinion this film tops the first one. But the film was forgotten when it first came out, and became even more overlooked as the years passed. ""Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey"" also bombed at the box office, whereas the first one was a pretty good hit and very popular. I think the problem may be that this film was just released a couple years too late.  In 1991, Bill and Ted already seemed ""so '80s"". Even though the '80s were only a couple years ago back at that time, the landscape of the music and style for kids had changed so radically with gangsta rap, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and the Seattle sound.  Bill and Ted with their Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N' Roses music along with their '80s style seemed so out of place and very outdated in '91, and I think that's one BIG reason the film bombed at the box office.  Nobody but surfers were still saying stuff like ""excellent!"" and ""bogus!"" in 1991. ""Gremlins 2"" which also came out in the early '90s suffered a similar fate of being a good film that bombed at the box office because it was too associated with the '80s.  The transition from the '80s to the '90s was a much faster change then now with the '90s and '00s.  1991 was nothing like 1988 or 1989, whereas right now, 2002 and last year 2001 still looks/looked like 1995 or 1996. If only ""Excellent Adventure"" which was made in 1988, was released THAT YEAR instead of 1989, and ""Bogus Journey"" was made quickly and released in 1989, then it too would have probably been just as wildly received as the first.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjdlNTZhODktZGU4NS00N2JkLWJjZGMtNWNkNzA3YjkzYjRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Getting a question how toxic the masculine gender was portrayed in the movie. A cheap unmannered antagonist was portrayed as hero. Are they promoting abuse as love? Violence, curse words, and blackmailing cannot be termed as love. That's purely ABSURDITY. Alcoholic man with zero self control is hazardous to the entire society. This shouldn't be accepted as an mood swings or possessiveness. Female lead character was also equally insane. Why the director wants to script female as a selfless, self respect less, sacrificing soul?

And I found myself loving it. Apart from sagging slightly in the pace in the middle with a couple of scenes that could've done with more punch perhaps, it has all the attributes that made me love Aardman in the first place.For instance, The Pirates! is a marvellous looking film, you could really tell that a lot of creativity and effort went into it. The colours and backgrounds are plentiful and rich with always something interesting to look at, and the character designs are appealing with the title character reminding of a youthful Wallace with hair and a beard. The 3D is one of the rare instances where it enhances the visuals and action rather than detract from it.Theodore Shapiro's music is enough to rouse the spirit, and does very well conveying a sense of adventure. The songs featured are fun and memorable. I also loved the crispness and wit of the dialogue managing to appeal to children and adults alike, and the story is exciting with lots of charm and heart. The characters appeal because of their larger-than-life personalities, true the names are on the generic side(Pirate Captain, Pirate with gout) but that was probably the intention. I did enjoy seeing the likes of Charles Darwin and Queen Victoria as well, and they especially Queen Victoria added a lot to the film.As for the vocal cast, the cast itself was one of the film's main attractions and the voice work is first rate. Hugh Grant shows impeccable comic timing, and Salma Hayak voices Cutlass Liz with lots of sass. Jeremy Piven shows that he can do wonderfully with a character that is strongly-written and provides a good contrast to Grant's Pirate Captain. Brendan Gleeson and Brian Blessed give rousing turns, David Tennant's Charles Darwin charms and Imelda Staunton voices Queen Victoria as if she were born to do it.Overall, Aardman does it again, a wonderful family film that anybody could enjoy. 9/10 Bethany Cox","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhkOGZkZWMtNGI4Mi00ZWI3LTgyYTgtMDU4ZDI3NTNjMWFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk1Njg5NTA@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

That is the only explanation I can offer as to why the House of the Dead movie exists. And that's only scary part to the whole movie. It's so bad you'll go off movies forever. I seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the TV over to the Paint Drying channel but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing. I don't know why I do these bad things to myself.As if it matters, here's the basic jist of the 'story'. A group of twenty-somethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the Pacific Northwest (Canada actually, because it's cheap) for the 'Rave of the Century' (which consists of about 8 people and un-raving music) that they pay some craggy old fisherman $1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry. That's gotta be some rave to be worth all that dough! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead (hang on-I thought this was HOUSE of the Dead?) and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda.First faults here. Why would a tiny little rave (of the Century my foot!) be held on some remote island? Why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it? Why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the others?Once they arrive they discover that the rave (which consists of about 2 tents, a small stage and a port-a-john) has been smashed, there's blood everywhere and no one is around. What would any rationally thinking person do? Run for their lives of course. But no, these clueless, obviously blind people decide to go look for them. Soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house that's 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside. Another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows, as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters, and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again. The characters, like the movie, go nowhere.Jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue, heinous acting, mumbo-jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once-popular arcade game of the same name. Why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers I'll never know. The clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further, if that is at all possible.It has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap, throwaway line at the end. It makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory. Hell, even the Double Dragon movie seems multi-Oscar worthy in comparison to this junk. The only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is Jurgen Prochnow. He could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character. The rest of the cast suck I'm afraid. The characters are idiots and deserve to die.Plus, if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity, I see no reason why this film cannot be shown on Saturday morning TV. It's not frightening in the slightest. Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film. And where did all those bad guys come from anyway? There were only a few people on the island to begin with. I guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over. I kid you not, you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times.Who's ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid? None other than director Uwe Boll. His control over the movie is non-existent. You can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies aren't really taking it all seriously. The actors seem like they're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card. It all feels very unnatural.Plus the film is shot like a two-part mini-series. I have indeed seen better TV productions. And don't get me started on the editing. The film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans. No real skill or talent was put into making this at all. It truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and George A. Romero can't even get anyone to take his calls. House of the Dead makes some idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be 'post-modern' but it only irritates that they think THIS is in the same league as a REAL zombie movie.For what it's worth, the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily over-used ADR even more. The DVD comes with extras but why torture yourself. Isn't this review warning enough? Stay away! You are all doomed I tell you! Doomed! Doomed!!!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzlmNTFlN2QtM2IxZi00NDc0LTgyMTQtNDNjNTBmODQzZDVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I just looked at the DVD and was amazed at how many details I still remember from that first viewing 26 years ago. Gunfire-addled IMDb voters are dead wrong; this should be a 9+, but I guess it gets docked two points for having no explosions and only one shooting (with a blank pistol, which probably doesn't count).The only ""modern romances"" in the same league are Richard Linklater's ""Sunrise/Sunset"" films, which I urge all fans of ""A Little Romance"" to see.As fine as Diane Lane has been in recent films, I don't believe she's ever been as good as she is here, 13 years old and simultaneously fresh as new snow and polished as silver plate. She absolutely belonged on that TIME magazine cover. It's a miraculous performance which may owe more to director Hill than to Lane herself, but who cares? Just enjoy it...her interview feature on the DVD is excellent, by the way.With the exception of ""Marathon Man"" and a couple of British TV plays, you can't find better late-period Olivier. He's simply delightful. If you are really perverse (like me), watch this and then compare with ""The Boys from Brazil,"" a dreadful Olivier movie from the previous year, which should have qualified Sir Larry as the all-time champion ""great actor working like hell while thigh-deep in pure crap."" Here it's the exact opposite: the consummate old pro, totally relaxed, tossing off another memorable performance because he's in a terrific movie that he doesn't have to try and save. This is how I choose to remember the older Olivier. Another old pro, Broderick Crawford, damn near steals the movie in his too-brief cameos. He has a wonderful moment with Thelonious Bernard that will charm anyone who's dealt with an aging person's fading memory.Arthur Hill, yet another reliable old guy, puts a nice turn on the #2 step-dad character. Who ever looked better in a business suit? The only truly unbelievable thing in the movie is that such a smart and understanding man would actually marry Sally Kellerman's vapid, starstruck mother character. Heavens, what a bitch. She doesn't deserve Arthur, and the scene in which he ejects equally vapid Potential Next Husband David Dukes from their lives is a classic of real-world, real man macho.It's a real shame that Thelonious Bernard didn't have a film career, but if you can only star in one movie, this is a pretty damn good one for it. The iconic freeze-frame final shot of him leaping above traffic to wave goodbye is something one never forgets. It's like the alternate universe version of the last shot in ""The 400 Blows."" One more thing: thank heavens there was no sequel.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDVhNjQyMTQtYTFhNy00MWNmLTkwZjEtNjc3MmQ2MDZhZmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

You could say this is Juno without the baby...or almost as useless and watered down as a straight to DVD movie...but you would be missing the point--not that every movie has to have a point.N&N is not trying to sell something or be something--it's not even trying to be great...because most love stories that try to be great fail. When you see N&N (and if you're in the mood for a lighthearted enjoyable movie, you should), don't go with an expectation of grandeur or even for the entire thing to be great. Alexis Diziena is as useless in this film as she is anorexic and whorish--her part is almost explicitly sexual. And there are so many subplots that their lives appear at times to be exaggerated. What matters almost seems to be camouflaged by what should be secondary.The movie succeeds in a number of understated ways, though. Ari Graynor's part is by far the funniest character of the bunch and Ari plays the part extremely well. The gay band Michael Cera is a member of adds a quirky afterthought to his character's back story. And what's most important--the characters Nick and Norah act like slightly more interesting versions of normal people. They have their flaws and their disagreements but they're capable of finding the beauty in each other and their story along the way.Movies should be about the creation and expansion of a spark of magic--not about giving you exactly what you expect or want. The perfection of the movie lives in its imperfections. The love is in the relationships that are real and what is fake gets left behind in a sketchy area near 10th street (that's not a spoiler). It amplifies grace with its soundtrack and hope with its random culmination of peculiar events over a single-night.So just let the infinite playlist play and enjoy it already.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY2MjI4ODI4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMyNjM4MQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The mysterious rock begins to levitate as its true intentions for the world and Godzilla are revealed.","148","Ah, the old stomping grounds of Tokyo...","""Godzilla 2000,"" actually completed in 1999 (and was released during the summer of 2000 in America), was the first Toho-backed kaiju-eiga film to receive a major theatrical distribution in the U.S. since 1985. I saw ""Godzilla 2000"" at the theater and wasn't disappointed, even though a lot has changed since Toho killed off their iconic monster at the end of 1995's ""Godzilla Vs. Destoroyah.""I'm 19; I've been a hardcore ""G""-fan since I was four years-old and of course, I was quite hesitant about seeing a new ""Godzilla"" film, being that the Americanized 1998 version wasn't that good. The Toho logo that appears during the opening credits reassured me that ""Godzilla 2000"" was taking me back to the good old days when Godzilla wasn't afraid to knock down a building or stomp down the military when they threatened him.With their third generation of ""Godzilla"" films being kicked off with this flashy new movie, Toho continued a trend that was seen in generation two, where they discard the events of the previous Godzilla incarnation and instead start with the original 1954 ""Godzilla"" and work from there.Toho took full advantage of this new series by designing a distinctly reptilian Godzilla, who as the film opens, has already popped up on the radar of some brainy scientist who argues that Godzilla should be studied, instead of destroyed.And Toho didn't skimp on creating a new monster either, which is a giant UFO that yields something a lot more than just martians. This new foe is actually a nasty little creature that's never given a name, though subsequent debate about the film has concluded that its name is ""Orga,"" who proceeds to try to consume Godzilla and his powers, thus creating one powerful monster.""Godzilla 2000"" has a lot of problems too, which may or may not mar an otherwise decent stomping experience. Though on the whole, it's nice to see Godzilla back in form (somewhat) and this Toho production firmly returns their most beloved creation to dominance, it also suffers a lot from the problems that have plagued its predecessors, and some of those problems may have been due to Roland Emmerich's 1998 Americanized version of the big green guy.Of course, since I never really cared for the people in a ""Godzilla"" movie and those feelings haven't changed, it must be pointed out here that the people have been drastically short-changed in favor of the all-out monster showdown that is the film's climax. You're really given a reason to not care about humans in this picture, whereas any previous ""Godzilla"" movie may have made you have an inkling of feeling for them.Godzilla himself has changed a lot, with massive plates that line his back and he's also been given a pretty nifty set of fangs. But the thing is, this Godzilla looks and behaves quite... different. Though it's evident with this production that Godzilla is the bad guy (pending on your view), this was one of the things that really struck me as unique about the previous generation of kaiju-eiga films - in that you never really knew if he was the bad guy or not - this movie makes that pretty clear to you, even though the new monster Orga is clearly the bigger problem for the people of Japan.The special effects in this third generation ""Godzilla"" film seem to actually be a step back too. The previous generation (the first two movies at least) had really beautiful and thoughtful effects that put you into wonder about how they were achieved. This series doesn't have that level of wonder for some reason. You'd expect their effects to improve over five years or so, but these effects look rushed and unrealistic.Aside from these quibbles, ""Godzilla 2000"" doesn't suffer a whole lot, but I was glad to see that it firmly reestablished Godzilla back to his good old, stomping self.7/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTU5YzliNTQtMjU0OS00ZjAzLTk3ZTgtZGI1NDc1ZTM1OTIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Fox's Remarkable Journey","Still was warmly and enthusiastically received at the SXSW Film Festival. An overflow crowd gave the film and its subject a standing ovation. Unlike your usual Hollywood Biopic, Still is an inspiring story of young, and perhaps somewhat superficial, movie star journey from celebrity to hero.The creative presentation shows the present-day disabled Fox struggling with the consequences of Parkinson's Disease and uses that as a jumping off point for his telling the story of how we went from struggling actor to mega Hollywood star. Then it journeys through his diagnosis with Parkinson's which he initially hid from the public as well as his struggle with alcoholism. Eventually, it shows the evolution of his role as he emerges as inspiration to millions who struggle with Parkinson's and many other disorders. His extraordinary fundraising efforts are a celebration of the human spirit. His dignity and decency in the face of an incurable disease are truly inspiring.The creative format of Guggenheim's film is fascinating, because he uses a mix of clips from Fox's TV and movies along with a series of recreations framed by modern day interviews to tell Fox's story. It is told with great humor and grace.For anyone of a certain age, Michael J. Fox was a cultural icon. Back to the Future is one of the iconic cultural markers of the 1980s. And Still really is in and of itself, appropriately enough, a journey back in time. In a time where we seem to lack heroes, Michael J.

The featured actress here is Edwige Fenech, and just as in every one her other movies, you pretty much know she is going to strip nude for somebody. She is actually outdone here, however, by the voluptuous Femi Benussi who has only about ten minutes of screen time but spends at least seven minutes of it completely nude and another two and a half squeezed into an ill-fitting bikini.As other reviewers have noted this movie is pretty politically incorrect which, depending on your temperament, you will either find offensive or ironically amusing. The woman pretty much fall into three categories: dumb, slutty, and dumb AND slutty. Edwige Fenech's character is strangely unperturbed after her lover grabs her by the throat when she implies he might be connected to one of the murder victims. Femi Benussi's character hilariously hops into bed with both men and women literally minutes after meeting them. Another woman stops a guy from raping her by willingly agreeing to have sex with him, then when he gets a little too, um, excited she turns down money he offers for services he was unable to render. The movie has the same tawdry revenge-for-an-abortion-gone-wrong theme of ""What Have You Done to Solange?"" but the murder victims are adults rather than schoolgirls and the murders themselves are slightly less tasteless. Still this movie sure seems a lot more sleazy than the earlier film because it is not nearly as well acted or directed. Bottom-of-the-barrel gialli like this and the similar ""So Sweet, So Dead"" manage to be sleazy, moralistic, and of course hypocritical all at the same time. Maybe that's why I enjoy them so much.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE2ZGJlZTItYmJiNi00ODkzLWE5NTAtMTY4NDdiZDIwYmUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Something seems to be in the way of her accepting the possibility of happiness in the simple things that she finds on her way, and that that might just be what she's looking for and therefore enough.A trip to the countryside brings back memories of her childhood as the youngest of three in a middle-of the road household in late 60's Japan. The thing is, it is SO well-done. Often, films focus on the misery of this life and the sweet innocent splendor of youth. This one turns it upside down, and not by depicting a horrible childhood which has to be ""taken care of"". Just by looking at things the way a child does.It's often the little things, that seem of no importance to adults, that mould a child, shape it's personality. The ""small killings"" so to speak. Events no one notices and no one readily remembers, but no one really forgets either. And when you remember them, they hurt in a way that you find unreasonable.So with this film. The flashbacks of not really a ""missed opportunity"" childhood, but rather of small events that stuck, chills you and sometimes fills you with warmth. It suggests at the same time that though there might be events that made her what she is, she also always was who she is, and it's the interplay between who you are and what you encounter that shape your life. You might say ""it might have gone a different way"", but then again it didn't exactly because you are you. Very Tao if you ask me. How it ends... just go and find out.The fact that the film, entirely inconspicuously, manages to pull it off to tell that in images, makes it great art. The subtitles are hazardous (sometimes too fast, too much on the screen...), but let that not spoil the splendor. Get out and rent it now.

There are always going to be flaws and holes in the plot, but this simple story only had a few minor ones that didn't detract from the movie at all. Tony Curran, I have seen many times before and I always expect good acting from him. Martin McCann, Jack Lowden, Ian Pirie and Kate Bracken did a really good job and their acting was of a very high standard along with the rest of the cast. All did a great job.This movie tells a very real story with realism you only see in top end productions. It had me glued to the screen almost from start to finish, not many movies do that for me.Highly recommended, but not for the squeamish. Even though there isn't really any over the top on screen violence in the movie, I still felt it was pretty gruesome.

Having bought the rights to Francis Iles' novel, and despite Hitchcock's insistence on sticking with the original ending, neither preview audiences nor the studio were ready to accept Cary Grant as a murderer. So its present ending was hastily written and shot. It completely subverts all the fine work that's gone before.Joan Fontaine was a brilliant actress and valiantly, passionately, breathlessly tries to make the shockingly amateurish dialogue in the final scene work -- ""Oh, Johnny! You were going to kill yourself instead of me, like the audience and I have thought for the last 90 minutes! Oh, Johnny! It's as much my fault as it is yours! Oh, Johnny! I was only thinking of myself . . . ,"" etc.Cary Grant does his best with this final abomination of a climax. ""Lina! Lina! How much can one man bear! When you and the audience thought I was in Paris murdering Beaky I was really in Liverpool!"" Etc.Huh?In other words, this beautifully produced, directed, acted and written psychological suspense thriller turns out to be about a charming lazy n'er-do-well who's sponged and embezzled his way through life, who marries a beautiful but neurotic aristocrat who, from day one, increasingly assumes the worst about her husband -- convincing herself (and us) that he's killed before and now is about to kill her?""Just kidding,"" the tacked-on final scene says. ""It was all innocent. You eating popcorn out there in the dark, and Lina, should be ashamed for even THINKING such things! Go home now."" It helps, out of self defense, to watch ""Suspicion"" with the original ending in mind. Yes, the milk is poisoned. Yes Johnny killed Beaky in Paris. Yes, he's a psychopath who lies, cheats, steals and kills. Yes, Lina believed him and loved him deeply -- the only man she's ever loved. Yes, her life is no longer worth living, now that she knows the truth about Johnny. Yes, she rightly suspects that milk is poisoned. So she writes a letter to her mother, telling the truth about Johnny's exploits, and that he is poisoning her as she writes -- and that she intends to die. She seals the letter and gives it to Johnny to mail. She drinks the milk. Johnny leaves and unknowingly drops Lina's letter into a mailbox, thus sealing his fate.THAT'S a rewarding ending.It also makes everything that's gone before (including writing, directing, performances and cinematography) plausible. It gives ""Suspicion"" a reason to exist.But that's the novel's ending.The film's ""Lina and the audience are just paranoid"" ending makes fools out of all the talent on display here.

Although a fan of the site, I skim read reviews, often not having the patience to read the long essays that over-excited people write. However, I feel it is my obligation to express my opinion on this movie because it is one of a short list of movies that has made an impact on me emotionally. I honestly believe that Christian Bale's performance in this movie was truly outstanding. If Denzel Washington can be rewarded for best actor in Training Day then Bale deserves his just rewards for Harsh Times. His portrayal of Jim David, an ex-army ranger, is coated in layers of emotional complexity and psychological deterioration. His ability to transform from an honourable, courteous officer to a full blown psycho and then back to loving boyfriend and 'amigo' is truly terrifying. Sharing much screen time with Bale is a relatively unknown Freddy Rodriquez. He seems to feed off Bale's character and forces the audience to feel sympathy for him as a childhood friend who can't abandon his crazy best friend. A cross between Benny Blanco (Carlito's Way) and Ethan Hawke's character in Training Day, Rodriquez shows his ability in mixing comedic moments up with emotional intensity and apathy. His friendship with Bale is so unpredictable that as an audience, you find yourself laughing with them at one moment and the next on the verge of tears. David Ayer has created a dark, moody portrayal of South Central Los Angeles, very similar to that of Training Day. It's a bleak, bustling environment where the main characters encounter drug dealers, gang leaders, prostitutes etc. What I found interesting was the way Ayer introduced the beautiful barren Mexican landscape amongst the roughness of LA life. This was to show the personal crossroads Bale's character experiences. The choice whether to stay in Mexico and marry his girlfriend, or to satisfy his sadistic urge to kill and work for the drugs squad in Columbia.It's frustrating that Harsh Times will not get the box office recognition it deserves. However, through word of mouth and DVD release, I am certain that this will become a sleeper classic, in the style of Shawshank Redemption. I feel that Christian Bale's performance is as mesmerising as De Niro's Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver or Edward Norton's character in American History X. His raw approach to the role makes for a startling but very rewarding experience.Overall Verdict: A tour de force of a movie with fantastic performances, stylish direction and an after-taste which will stay with you for a very long time. Not since American History X has a movie affected me on such an emotional level. Christian Bale deserves more credit. Much more.....9.5/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mzc1NTY1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTMxOTY3._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It is, in fact, none of those things.A thoroughly entertaining, not too cerebral, romp down one box conveyor after another, the film succeeds at wrapping it's central theme of persecution and prejudice in layers of equally significant ideas: group self-identification, class ambition, dalliant obsessions, self-esteem, and self-destructive addiction. It follows a nicely predictable plot arc that will satisfy your children while you ponder whether the plucky heroine's ostensible obsession with the macabre is likely a reflection of a Freudian complex with roots in her father's indifference. The bad guy with his crooked teeth and greazy hair is unmistakably evil. But at the same time the good guys aren't wearing the white hats. In fact, it's comparing and poking fun at both incompetence and maliciousness.The animation finds it's grounding in a setting that is reminiscent of Corpse Bride. From the industrial green palate of the box trolls to the stiff and starched characterization of the patrician class, the visual design of the film holds together well.After the film you'll walk out of the theater with lots of things on your mind, but you won't be walking out with a child who was bored to sleep or fits by another didactic feature of animated hogwash.

After all, Charlie Brown and the rest of the characters created by Charles Schulz have been huge business for decades, and it makes sense that they would put something together if for no other reason than to keep the characters active in pop culture.Thankfully, it appears that the people behind ""The Peanuts Movie"" take the legacy of these characters very seriously, and the result is a gentle, charming movie that seems far less frantic than much of what is created for young audiences these days. Blue Sky, one of the two major producers of CG animated films for Fox, has produced ten feature films now, and while the majority of their efforts have been originals, it was clear from ""Horton Hears A Who"" that when they adapt someone else's property, they try to do so from a position of authenticity and respect.One of the things that makes ""Peanuts"" such a broad target is all the different versions there have been. Even in our editorial meetings at HitFix, as we talk about the films or the specials that we think of when ""Peanuts"" is mentioned, we all have our own take on what that means. For me, the old school TV specials and the first few movies were the defining version. Louis Virtel told me he always thinks of ""Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown!"" first. My kids have been exposed to some of the specials, but Toshi took it upon himself to read the Fantagraphics collections of all of the strips that I have on my shelves. And to any of those people, I would say, ""You'll recognize the 'Peanuts' you love in this movie, and you'll be happy."" That could not have been an easy task, so for that alone, Blue Sky and Fox deserve some accolades.One of the most interesting choices they made in approaching the movie was how to design the characters. They are 3D CG objects, but the faces are ""drawn"" onto the heads in a way that always feels like there's a physical brush stroke, a pencil mark. I assume the entire thing is CG, but it connects the characters to the long hand-made tradition that started with the comic strip itself. It's a strong stylistic decision, and it makes sure the characters feel like the characters we already know. Steve Martino, working from a script by Bryan Schulz, Craig Schulz, and Cornelius Uliano, touches on any number of familiar jokes and scenes and set-ups, with a number of references to the long history of the characters. Snoopy spends most of the movie working on a book on his newly-discovered typewriter, the story of a flying ace and his battle against the infamous Red Baron. Sally's got her crush on her sweet baboo, Linus, who nurses his faith in the the Great Pumpkin. Lucy gives advice at her sidewalk psychiatric stand while making passes as Schroeder every chance she gets. Peppermint Patty and her assistant Marcie both play their familiar roles as well, with Charlie Brown at the center of everything, constantly put upon, constantly taking one on the chin. If this is going to be true to the original strip that Schulz created, then Charlie Brown has got to be suffering, a kid who can't catch a break.What surprised me was the way they took a quiet approach to finding something else to say about Charlie Brown. I was worried that this was going to be a film where they had to turn him into something he wasn't just to tick some demographic checklist, and instead, the film makes some very strong and interesting points about what is heroic when you're just a kid trying to define yourself. In this case, there's a new kid in school, the Little Red-Haired Girl, and Charlie Brown is determined to reinvent himself in a way that will win this girl's attention and approval. This being Charlie Brown, things are not that easy, but I thought the way they eventually bring it together was unexpectedly honest. At this point, these characters have been playing the same beats for so long that it is genuinely surprising to see them do something new that doesn't feel like a violation of the characters, but rather a natural extension of what we already know about them.The cast of young voice actors all seem appropriately chosen, and it's interesting to hear how they've gone out of their way to find kids who naturally sound like the voices that have been connected to the characters for over 40 years now. One of the reasons I don't ever want a ""Calvin & Hobbes"" adaptation to happen is because I don't want to hear anyone else's take on how Hobbes should sound, but with these characters, they've had the same voices for so long now that it's kind of like a magic trick. It's a cast of real kids here, but they sound like the ""real"" Charlie Brown, the ""real"" Lucy, the ""real"" Linus.Frequently very funny, undeniably aimed at younger audiences, and true to the source material, ""The Peanuts Movie"" is too mild-mannered to win over brand new audiences, but it's going to please people who were already fond of the underlying property, and it should be a big nostalgia-driven hit for the studio.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTE5NzMxNzkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ0Nzk5NzE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Right at that point he needed a paycheck.Granger and Fabian play the brothers Pratt, George and Billy and John Wayne is their partner Sam McCord in a gold claim that's just hit it big. He's got to buy mining equipment in Seattle and Pratt's fiancÃÂ© Jennie is there too. Wayne's to bring back both the equipment and Jennie.But Jennie has off and got herself married. So Wayne in a moment of alcoholic brilliance spots another girl with a French accent in a pleasure palace called the Birdcage and decided to take her back to Alaska for Granger. She's played by Capucine. But things don't quite work out.Of course there's another kind of claim jumping going on led by no-good cynical gambler Ernie Kovacs. All kinds of problems for the McCord-Pratt partnership. If you like your comedy broad and unsophisticated North to Alaska is your kind of film. The Duke has some of his funniest screen moments in this film. There's a whole routine with Granger and Capucine trying to make Wayne jealous and with Fabian serving as a straight man to Wayne, it's a pretty funny bit of business. Wayne's facial expressions are alone worth seeing the movie.John Wayne was always shrewd in marketing his films and he sought to woo a younger audience by having current teenage idols in his films around that time. He had Ricky Nelson in Rio Bravo and Frankie Avalon in The Alamo and now Fabian in North to Alaska.I saw an interview with Fabian some years ago where he said Wayne was a formidable presence on the set of his film. He was great when you got to know him and he accepted you. But you did things his way or it was the highway, no questions asked.Fabian has some moments too as a 17 year old whose hormones get going at the sight of Capucine. He sings a song in the film, If You Only Knew. But the real song hit is the title tune sung by Johnny Horton over the title. It was a big hit for Horton in his short and tragic career. Frankie Laine also sold a few platters with this song.If your taste is sophisticated drawing room comedy, this ain't your film. But fans of the eternal Duke will love it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2QyYjQ3YmYtODkxYi00Njc3LTg2ODItNjM5MjdjMzhiYmFkL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It is very clearly intentionally a ""joke"" of a film. That people would complain about bad acting, strange dubbing, and/or a convoluted plot just leaves me flabbergasted. From the very beginning, it should be evident that a big part of the point of the film is its own self-deprecating humor. Jackie loses his memory and is picked up by a primitive African tribe. The chief asks him, in an unintelligible language, ""Where do you come from? What is your name?"" to which Jackie replies (not understanding the questions) ""What am I doing here? Who am I?"" This is a JOKE, folks. A few minutes later, Jackie saves a snake-bite victim with an IV he improvises from a COCONUT! When he's returned to ""civilization,"" the doctor is impressed with that tactic, saying, ""That coconut IV technique is only used by elite military units!"" Is there any way to even dream of taking the plot/dialogue seriously at this point?The acting is ""bad"" by design. The actors were obviously told to ham up everything they did. The meeting of the American intelligence officials is a completely ironic reference to the same sort of scene you'd expect in any James Bond movie. Dialogue is intentionally absurd, plot developments are intentionally obvious. The ""Morgan"" character is played perfectly (and hilariously) as a crooked CIA operative out for his own gain while feigning loyalty to the USA.Yuki is a master stunt-driver with the naivete and wide-eyed innocence of a schoolgirl. Christine Stark is a completely laughable ""reporter"" who fools Jackie only as a result of his head injury; after she's ""exposed,"" she rescues Jackie in an golf cart that can't seem to move faster than an electric wheelchair.That the villains actually join each other in a verse of song (""Friendship, friendship!"") near the end should serve as a good reminder of just how camp this picture strives to be. To criticize it for this as a ""failing"" seems to me to profoundly miss the point. Did the same viewers dislike that ""Hot Shots: Part Deux"" was absurd too?Overall, the strengths of the film deserve the attention: it is a very funny parody of the overplotted ""action/intrigue"" genre, it has a terrific car chase, notable action sequences, and a terrific Jackie-Chan-Style fight scene at the beginning of the film's climax.Perhaps I enjoyed this movie because I had grown up watching the ""GI Joe"" cartoon series, and had always been rather insulted by the fact that it managed to be both preachy and stupid at the same time. If you're looking for a great 100 minutes of parody and HUMOR, I'd recommend this movie. If you're more interested in believability and suspending your disbelief, this film will definitely not work for you at all. Inappropriate expectations would be the only ""problem"" I can imagine that would reduce one's enjoyment of this film.If you want a more serious Jackie Chan film, you might try Drunken Master II, or Police Story. But if you're looking for an enjoyable and sardonic 100 minutes, this is truly one of Jackie's great vehicles.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWFiZDA1MjMtZmYwNi00ZjQyLTgxY2MtYjVjMGE5ODczNzc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MTM5NjI2._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This is one movie that truly does not deserve its notorious reputation(either in the negative or positive sense). It's just your typical silly and pretentious 70's Eurotrash. It is slightly less boring than the director's previous ""Emmannuelle"" (1974) but only slightly. The lead (and only conceivable reason to watch this nonsense) is Corrine Clery,who was later a second-string Bond girl eaten by vicious dobermans in ""Moonraker"". Clery spends most of the movie naked and being whipped by various men and women. This certainly sounds pretty sordid, but the movie (tastefully?) never shows the whip actually hitting her. And though she is almost constantly being flogged, there never seems to be a mark on her on her perpetually on-display body. She is also passed around by various men, but the sex scenes are even more circumspect than the whipping scenes. I'd enjoy watching Clery doing anything naked(mowing the lawn, painting a fence, digging a garden), but there's just nothing especially exciting here. Mostly, the movie consists of cheesy dialogue and idiotic libertine philosophizing. I don't know if you have to be a sadist to enjoy it, but you definitely have to be a masochist to sit through it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWIyMzhiZDUtNmUyYi00Y2IwLThjNzAtOWFlM2ZhMTcwODY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

A lot of the negative reviews seem to be awfully nitpicky for a family Disney movie. It's no masterpiece but I can't understand all the hate.As we can all agree, it's visually stunning. The costumes are magnificent as well as hair and makeup. The sets are stunning and surprisingly, according to some of the interviews I've watched, most of it is not CGI. They created a beautifully detailed world and it pays off.The story is not the same as the ballet, nor does it claim to be. I personally wouldn't want it to be the same. We get to experience the beloved elements of The Nutcracker in a new way. Though there's a lot of room for improvement, specifically in the script, I really enjoyed the new story. The dynamic between Clara and her late mother is great and is the real emotional draw of the film. Because it's a Disney film aimed at kids, the script is awfully cheesy at times, but not enough to be distracting.Clara herself should be a strong selling point of the film. She's highly intelligent, specifically in engineering and physics. They make it a point to differentiate Clara from her sister, Louise, a proper (for that time period) young English woman. Not that there's anything wrong with being all prim and proper, in fact, Clara admittedly does spend a lot of the film in beautiful dresses and makeup. And yet, she's still the hero and she still kicks ass. This is important because it associates these feminine traits with power.Hear me out on this. I feel like so many of the strong heroines we know and love are, in some ways, stripped of their femininity. They're typically made to be a strict ""tomboy"" who's ""not like other girls."" This by itself isn't the problem. The problem is that instead of embracing feminine traits, they diminish them. I know gender roles are bull, believe me, but I don't think women should be shamed for being what society deems feminine. You can be a bad b**** AND enjoy princess dresses. Women should not have to adopt ""masculine"" traits in order to succeed. Because of this, I think Clara is a fantastic role model for young girls who will almost undoubtedly take something from her.So, although it's far from perfect, it's fun, beautiful, and full of heart. It's not claiming to be the next Shawshank Redemption so I don't see why it's being drilled so hard. It's a delightful little Disney movie, don't think so much about the specifics and just enjoy.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg1NDI1MjEyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTA5MTgwNjM@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Well, the critics were right about this one: it was good. It's an excellent adventure film that really gets you involved with the story. The story, off the famous book written by Jack London, involves a young adult male's adventures during the gold rush days of Alaska at the end of the 19th century.Some of the Alaskan scenery in here is just magnificent. I have talked to a couple of people who have been around the world and they both said Alaska had the most incredible scenery of any place they'd been, and you see evidence of that in this movie. They did a nice job with the action scenes in here: not too much, not too little and pretty realistic. The dog-fighting scenes aren't pleasant, but they aren't bloody, either. The villains, led by James Remar, are nasty but not profane.This is not a typical Disney film, at least at the time of its release, because the violence is intense at times and there is some profanity. It's a rugged story about rugged people in a rugged land. These adventurers had to be rough to survive.Ethan Hawke plays the young man-hero whom we all root for, and the way he builds a relationship to wolf-dog ""White Fang"" is touching to view. The movie offers everything but humor but they do throw one funny line in at the end, by one of the villains, no less.Summary: a memorable adventure. One of Disney's best films of any genre. I am amazed there are less than 20 reviews of this movie.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjZTkxYzYtMTQwZC00YWU1LWFlNWUtMDlhYWExMmFiY2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzA5MzkyOTM@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

So, I started watching the film with a certain caution, checking if it's appropriate to my 13-year-old princess. I must say that my worries were in vain - and now I understand why some found the movie 'disturbing' - simply because the story tells the hard truth - but not every parent is able to accept or understand it. This film is a fantasy, but it shows how the fashion industry exploits and destroys girls, lured by the glamor of the 'supermodel' world. The film clearly tells that 'All that glitters is not gold', using a very delicate metaphorical language. So, in my view it's a must watch for teen girls - and their parents. I'm not naÃÂ¯ve - I don't think any movie, or a book, can 'save' anyone - but at least it may make you think twice before sending your daughter's portfolio to a modeling agency.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhhNTI4NGUtYjM1ZC00MWM3LWE4YjgtYTQ5NjU1MGU2NGQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI0MDQwMDc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I saw it on the first Saturday of its original release. The theater was jam-packed and the crowd was excited. You could actually feel the crowd's buzzing with anticipation for this movie. The stars mainly sold the movie but also the film was made by the same team that made GHOSTBUSTERS. The hype was quite big back then. When the end credits rolled, the crowd was quiet and the buzz was gone. The buzz died halfway into the film as every lame attempt at comedy or romance fell flat with a big thud and everything seemed forced and juvenile. I cannot relate how disappointed the crowd, my friends and I were about it. Some scenes are truly cringe-worthy bad. The flimsy script is as paper thin as the paper is was written on and the entire big budget comedy hangs heavily on the poor thing, incapable of overcoming its many inherent weaknesses.The actors try to do their best with what they have, with Redford being the sole actor with any charm in this charmless bloated thing. But the worst aspect of this ""movie by committee"" is Debra Winger's performance. It's so bad that her career never really recovered after it. She was supposed to be this Katherine Hepburn type who fell for Redford's debonair and free-thinking ways and she came across as someone who was perpetually constipated. Redford and Winger have zero chemistry, which doesn't help much for romance comedy. Nothing worked in LEGAL EAGLES, including the ending, which from what I read, is one of several endings the producers filmed and the awful one we saw was decided thanks to the bad taste of test audiences.There's a reason why this big profile movie only has 3 pages of reviews here at IMDb.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMwNjE2OGMtNmUwMi00YzhlLTg1YjQtMzhlODRiNDhiMTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The cartoonish, satirical bent the film has (in the face of its horrific situations) is exactly what makes it so brilliant. What was so awful about ""Pretty Woman"" was the commodification of prostitution as something glamorous, fulfilling and rewarding; pablum to be swallowed by American masses. ""Whore""'s success depends less on the performances and direction and more on the viewer's willingness to think. The ideology that Ken Russell has placed on the material is unmistakable and renders everything else about the film meaningless. It really comes down to the viewer--If you are intelligent enough as a viewer to read the subtext, you either agree with it or you don't. Personally, I love everything about it, from Teresa Russell's sarcastic, bombastic, career-wrecking performance to the simple joy of seeing Antonio Fargas on screen again, ""Whore"" is a great, intelligent film worth repeated viewings. The real tragedy is that this will be Ken Russell's last great film. He has lived long enough to see his wonderful style get railroaded into soft-core porn and made-for-cable sci-fi.

The film is NOT about Don Juan !2.  The film tells us how to rekindle love in our lives, even if we are old and gray-haired.   This is so very important!!3.  If we do not have a good dose of fantasy, of rich imagination, of beautiful dreams in our lives, then we will become 'burned out' by the harsh boredom of reality-as-we-perceive it. We are also challenged by the question ""What really is real?""4.  If we have too much fantasy and not enough reality, then we cannot cope with the rest of the world. Also, society will not be able to cope with us and we will be isolated, perhaps in a mental institution or at least in our own twisted world.Oh - did I say that this film is not about Don Juan?  Well, in a sense, I lied. It is and it is not.  See the film and think about it.Superbly well acted by Johnny Depp, Marlon Brando, and Fay Dunaway (what an incredible beauty even at her age!). An amazing script and a very original story.  Unless you understand the meanings above, or if you have a cold heart, you'll probably rate it a 5 or 6.

He has made the unfortunate mistake of imitating a genre he loves without understanding what makes it work. The dialogue is half nonsensical exposition, half nauseating one-liners. Lots of clumsy penis and vagina jokes. The plot is so diffuse...there is not enough time given to any character for them to be read as an actual character. The film fails in tying together any of these frayed threads and also fails to make what happens in any of them significant or sensible. For example there is a ""betrayal"" plot which happens in the first two minutes of the film, when there is no context to make that betrayal meaningful, make the traitor seem particularly villainous, etc. The acting is very broad and simplistic, which I guess is to be expected given the things RZA expects them to say. He doesn't seem to understand that all of these things, the characters, dialogue, plot points, etc. are pointless without a proper context.Some people might be inclined to tell me it's the ""point"" of the movie to not have a story, to be a loose framework on which a series of fight scenes are hung. I'd first suggest that that is not a meaningful effort to make. But even as a visual spectacle or stylistic effort, it doesn't do very well. All of the fights are basically the same knife/sword play... none of the characters really have a specific fighting style, and the CGI gore lopped onto the fights is excessive and silly. The music cues are embarrassingly overdone...any time the film wants you to feel an emotion, the sappiest orchestral music instantly kicks in, to the beat of a hip hop song.I think it's possible that RZA could make a good film someday, but this certainly isn't it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5ODI3ODkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQxNjUwOA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

That contained no ""twerking"" or ""fart jokes"" like in the trailer (I think they were only animated for the trailer, not too sure why). The movie is smart and funny, it has good messages for kids and maybe even adults. Super action packed and also for any Sherlock fans, I spotted a couple sherlock related easter eggs. It is not only exciting but very beautifully animated and the lighting is also stunning. I think that this take on Sherlock Holmes is a very different one but still stays true to Conan Doyle's story (the easter eggs are very clever). I believe it is a good way to introduce kids to those characters. It is also impressive since this movie came from Paramount which has little to no experience in the animation world. I have no idea how the creators of this movie were able to make ""Sherlock Gnomes"" into a really great animated movie, that is closer to a Disney or Pixar type movie then an illumination movie.Last thing, not too sure why its getting such terrible reviews (19% on rotten tomatoes) I would say at worst some parts of the movie are mediocre, but it still does not deserve 19%.

Not even regarded as an actor, more of a comedian, prior to this, Fry (himself gay, and something of an intellectual) puts across all the nuances and contradictions of the subject perfectly. This Wilde is torn between what is accepted love (his wife, and children), and the 'love that dare not speak its name' (primarily his destructive relationship with the needy, selfish and petulant Lord Alfred Douglas, played here by Jude Law in the role which brought him to world attention). We see his charm and conviction when creating his plays or amusing friends, we also see his weaker side and why he was the cause of his own eventual arrest and imprisonment, we see how prison changed him and - as he wrote himself in De Profundis - broke his spirit and his health.Watch out for other, now big, names in the cast - Ioan Gruffudd, Michael Sheen, Orlando Bloom - alongside the established players such as Vanessa Redgrave (Oscar's mother, Sperenza), Jennifer Ehle (Lady Constance Wilde), Tom Wilkinson (Marquess of Queensbury, Bosie's father), Gemma Jones (Bosie's mother), and Judy Parfitt.A fitting musical score, a smattering of Wilde's epigrams, and a large chunk of his children's story 'The Selfish Giant' (driving and commenting on the action at key points) leave this film close to perfection when detailing the story of the misunderstanding of another age, not too far back from our own.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRjYWM5YmQtZDBlNC00ZWNjLThkMDMtYWIzZGQwYjA2ZDQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

But I bought the triple feature DVD pack of the Psycho sequels, I watched Psycho 3 last night, it wasn't that bad. The only complaint I have is that it felt a little too Friday the 13th to me, a little too slasher. From the first Psycho, we had more left to the imagination and a little more thriller/mystery, Psycho 3 doesn't use that same formula, but it still leaves you in chills. It is almost kind of a tribute in some of the shots and lines from the original, I think that is thanks to Anothony Perkins, it was interesting to see him direct the film, not the worst I've seen for a horror sequel, but the story itself is alright.Norman is back in business, running the Bates Motel, he needs a helping hand, so Duane Duke, musician bum, is his new assistant manager. When a former nun, Maureen, comes to stay in the motel, she reminds Norman of Marian Craine, he falls for her. But it's a question if his mother will let him be with Maureen. Duane is also bringing problems back into Norman's killing spree of bar fly's and a homecoming party.Psycho 3 is worth the look, believe me, when you've seen so many horror sequels that were just beyond horrible, this was a breathe of fresh air. The story does keep your interest, if you are into blood and gore, you will not be disappointed on that note. But I'm looking at this as to what should be a tribute to the first film, the slitting of the throat to me wasn't Norman Bates. But if you want to see the sequel, I wouldn't hold you back, the sequel is worth the watch if you are curious about the sequels, just this was a little too bloody for my tastes.4/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDliYTg2NjItMmExYS00NjBlLWEzNTAtMDE5Mjg0MmQ5ZTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's a quiet, contemplative film, brimming with sadness and humor, and lead by a wonderful central performance.Nicole Kidman returns to the theme that first brought her to international attention - that of a mother grieving the loss of a child, and the emotional aftermath that such a trauma entails. Of course in the two decades since Dead Calm was released, Kidman has explored of multitude roles and worked with some of the finest directors in the industry. She has gained such an authority on screen - yet somehow, here, she manages to strip away all of our preconceptions so that we are left with something as raw and natural as she was opposite Sam Neil at the age of 21. This is her most fully-rounded character and detailed performance in years - nimble, layered and completely magnetic.Becca's journey with her husband Howie (Aaron Eckhart), eight months after the tragic accident that killed their son, is beautifully captured by Cameron Mitchell's lens. Despite the film's stage origins, the story never feels too talky or confined, shots are simple yet beautifully composed, the editing and pace have a fluid rhythm. The couple's facade of normalcy - making dinners, attending pious bereavement groups and keeping up appearances with friends and neighbors, begins to crack as the mementos of their son's life disappear. Becca gives his clothes to goodwill and takes his paintings off the fridge, she accidentally deletes a video of him playing on a swing - causing a distraught reaction in Howie. The difference in the way this couple deals with the loss is compelling, and the friction between them palpable outside of the few explosive scenes.Their disconnect becomes more and more apparent, and Eckhart plays it with a wounded humanity that's really effective. Howie wishes they could ""get back on track"" and perhaps try for another baby, something which Becca is not prepared to do. Instead he starts hanging out with Gabby, a woman from their bereavement group, played by the always reliable Sandra Oh. Meanwhile prickly moments between Becca and her irresponsible sister Izzy (Tammy Blanchard) are very well played and Dianne Wiest provides a lot of warmth and wisdom as Becca's mother, but doesn't really get a defining moment. Becca both yearns to escape the reminders of her grief and seeks closure and solace in her pursuit of Jason, the young man who accidentally ran over her son. This strand of the story, exploring the idea of parallel universes and fate, gives the story a unique edge and Miles Teller is easily the stand out of the supporting cast.Ultimately what gives this film its power is that Mitchell's focus is always fiercely rooted in the reality of the situation, side-stepping the potential sentimentality of the subject - biting humor undercuts the sorrow and there certain moments of confrontation between Becca, Howie and Jason that strike quite a visceral chord. The scenes on the bench between Kidman and Teller contain moments of such purity and depth as to be heartbreaking - and to me, the final montage is one of the most sublime and emotionally resonant endings of the past decade. I can't recommend the film enough, and if there's any justice in the world Kidman will finally be recognized again by the Academy.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzOTU0NjMxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzc5MDUxNA@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I didn't. I found it very interesting and while not mind-bendingly great, it wasn't the horror that it's presented to be in some of these reviews.""Denial"" is based on the book ""History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier."" It is the story of Deborah E. Lipstadt (Rachel Weiss) and her legal battle in a libel trial brought by Holocaust denier David Irving (Timothy Spall). In the British legal system, the burden of proof is on Lipstadt, who has maintained in her writings that Spall has fudged certain facts and left out others to make his case that the Holocaust did not happen. Her team, led by Richard Rampton (Tom Wilkinson) and Anthony Julius (Andrew Scott) make it clear to the feisty Deborah that they are putting Irving on trial. They are not interested in Holocaust survivor testimony, because they say that Irving will make mincemeat out of them since their memories often aren't perfect. They do not want her to take the stand. The trial is to prove the truth of Lipstadt's writings about Irving.One of the reviewers wrote that the Irving portrait is highly distorted. The dialogue in the courtroom is verbatim from the actual transcripts. You tell me if this man is a Jew-hating racist or not and if he in fact misrepresented facts to fit his agenda. No one said he didn't have a right to believe what he believed, to make jokes about other races during speeches, to teach his daughter racist songs, make fun of the Holocaust, and write his opinions. But he brought the lawsuit because he was accused of distorting facts, no one else did. The most moving scene was the team's visit to Auschwitz, very well photographed and movingly acted.The acting was sensational, though I have to admit that Rachel Weisz did overplay at certain points. She is a wonderful actress, and having seen her in person in ""Betrayal,"" I can testify that she's unbelievably gorgeous in person. But the director could have toned her down a little in some scenes. Andrew Scott is one of the finest young actors around, and he's brilliant as always. Tom Wilkinson is perfection as Richard Rampton.Why this film should have incited such awful comments on this board is beyond me. It's a movie. If you want to know more about Holocaust denial, read up on it. Read up on Irving. See if you think his character was distorted. Everyone knows films use dramatic license. Denial is not perfect. It has some clichÃÂ©s, it has the David v. Goliath thing going - and yes, none of that is new.

That little gnawing sensation that the director would hope you feel while watching his thriller.Jack Lemmon's performance is a fine one, and Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas follow. I felt so much empathy of Lemmon, who's character Jack Godell, only wanted people to listen to his warning.But what impresses me most about this film is the lack of a score, and this is also what makes it beautiful to me. Apart from the opening titles there are no background music to increase the tension, because none is needed. And while the credits run, white on black, in silence it drives the point home. I use the movie as an example to anyone who says music makes the movie. I think the movie should make the movie and the music should only amplify that. But for The China Syndrome music is not necessary to get across the realism and the urgency depicted here. The characters portray all of this far better than the music ever could.I highly recommend this movie, it is one of my favorites. If you like movies, you won't be disappointed.

So 'Prizzi's Honor', which ridicules its protagonists and shows them to be anything but wise, is a welcome sort of mafia film. Unfortunately, although it's reasonably entertaining, the film ultimately doesn't wholly succeed in any respect; too daft to work as black comedy, too slow to work as riotous farce, to humorously conceived to work as tragic drama. Jack Nicholson is good as the dumb hit man Charley, but the plot leaves us unsure whether we should laugh at him or cry with him, and in the end I felt inclined to do neither.

"Exotica","2020.0","A","103.0","Drama","7.0","72.0","Atom Egoyan","Bruce Greenwood, Elias Koteas, Don McKellar, David Hemblen","21,120","A man plagued by neuroses frequents the club Exotica in an attempt to find solace, but even there his past is never far away.","90","The Taboo of Human Contact","'Exotica' is clearly Egoyan's best film and his most successful presentation of the motifs that have characterized his films throughout his career; these include the presentation of the narrative out of chronological order, the interaction of characters by means of videotape and hidden surveillance, the relationship between parent and child, and the repetition of situation and dialogue.  The film's theme involves the superficial barriers-both physical and psychological-that prevent people from making a genuine emotional connection with others; as we watch the film we witness how various people react to these barriers and struggle to break them down. The film's strong emphasis on structure and focus on Thomas' and Francis' parallel 'hunts' for human contact can't help but remind of that masterpiece of medieval literature 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight' (this is a work that Egoyan was born to adapt to the screen). In my opinion each of the film's six major characters parallels another to compile three pairs.  The first pair of characters is composed of Thomas and Zoe.  The most obvious similarity between these two is that each owns one of the film's two principle locations.  Thomas' pet store and ZoÃÂ«'s strip-club are comparable in that both are businesses whose principle merchandise is living creatures that are excessively displayed so as to persuade the customer to make a purchase.  Moreover, while the pet store is lined with glass cages and fish-tanks, the walls of the strip-club are composed of two-way mirrors through which employees can secretly observe the customers. In addition to the life that each openly sells, both also possess hidden life.  We see this in ZoÃÂ« by the fact that she is very pregnant, but must disguise her appearance so as not to remind customers of the possible consequences of the lecherous behavior that her club encourages. Likewise, in the film's first scenes we see that Thomas is pregnant in a different way.  Here, he is smuggling exotic bird eggs into the country by strapping the eggs to his stomach in order to hide them from Canadian customs officials.  This hidden life also extends to their introverted personalities.  To combat their inability to communicate verbally, both try to make interpersonal connections by means of physical contact.  In a sense, then, Thomas and ZoÃÂ« (as the Greek origin of her name might suggest) are givers of life both openly in their businesses and privately in their interaction with others. Next, Francis and Eric are parallel characters because of their mutual obsessions with Christina.  Although Christina is intended to be seen as a sex object, neither Francis nor Eric has any interest in her in this regard. Instead, she symbolizes an emotional relationship that both once had, but now have lost.  When they eventually discover their real relationship, Francis and Eric find that they do not need Christina and make an emotional bond with each other, which is symbolized by a physical embrace. Lastly, Christina and Tracey can be associated because Francis considers both as symbols of his dead daughter.  However, Francis' relationships with Christina and Tracey both fail because he is unable to develop bonds that go beyond their assigned roles as a stripper and babysitter.  Therefore, while ZoÃÂ« and Thomas can be seen as givers of life, Christina and Tracey clearly receive life by taking on the roles that Francis and Eric impose on them. There are also many reoccuring images and symbols that reinforce the emotional isolation of the characters.  The use of secret surveillance by two-way mirrors serves both as an invisible yet uncrossable boundary between people who would otherwise be very close to one another and as a way for the characters to make private judgments of those who are being unwittingly observed.  In fact, while Eric secretly observes and judges Francis during his nights at Exotica, Francis, because of this job as an auditor, does the same to Thomas during the day.  Egoyan reminds us that this relationship can ultimately be extended to include the audience members, who also make private judgments of the film's characters (we've this before in films like Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' and Powell's 'Peeping Tom').  As we watch the film, we too are in a sense reaching out to forge an emotional connection that transcends the barrier of the medium itself. The film's overriding presence of money suggests to the characters that the only legitimate grounds for a relationship is financial, and any time an emotional connection is made the characters feel guilty if they are not paying for it. Finally, the frequent appearance of parrots and their uncharacteristic silence reflects the characters' inability to communicate and overcome the losses of their past.  I've really grown to admire this film and Egoyan's work in general.  In 'Exotica' he creates a work of complex symmetry and interconnecting symbols while also conveying an atmosphere of lyrical intensity.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2U3MmIyODktNGYzOS00NzYwLTlkMjEtNDcxOTlmZmNjZWNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzU4ODM5Nw@@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Although Netflix produced this year's greatest films, it's a shame that those films will never play on the big screens. So you can imagine how honoured and grateful I was to attend a preview of BARDO with Alejandro G. Inarritu, one of my favourite directors of all time, who came himself and presented his film. You could tell how happy he was to present the film, as it clearly is his most personal and intimate work to date.I was hoping for the best, but didn't expect too much as the film received quite mixed first reviews from Venice and other previews. That's why I wasn't prepared for the journey Inarritu would take me on for the next three hours. BARDO isn't only easily the best film of the year so far, it was also one of the most beautiful and profound cinematic experiences I've had in my life - that's the reason why I started my review by saying that it's a shame most people will only experience this on their TV. It's really a shame. The images Inarritu and his godlike DoP Darius Khondji produce here are far beyond incredible. The first half hour of the film, I constantly had goosebumps because of the sheer beauty of this film. I often say that I deeply appreciate when a film invents new, unseen images, when the team behind the film almost invent a new cinematic language. They absolutely do here.The film might feel too long for some, pretentious for others, but it was just the film I was waiting for since a long time, not knowing I was until I've watched it. It was one of these rare films which I didn't ever want to end, and the fact that I knew it was going to run for three hours actually comforted me many times throughout the sublime time I had watching this.BARDO is undoubtedly Inarritu's most ambitious film yet, this film feels - and is - HUGE. It's an incredible homage to the country Mexico (I've sat through the whole endless credits and he literally only hired Mexicans to work on this film), but moreover, it's one of the most touching and honest films about family. Where in many films depicting family relationships can feel cheesy and superfluous, here it really worked, and moved me in a way no other film did. That is also due to the fact that all actors are nothing less than absolutely outstanding. Led by the revelation of the year, Daniel GimÃÂ©nez Cacho, who plays the role of Silverio and easily carries the very heavy weight of this opus on his shoulders, the film already had a complex character who you could easily identify with. But every actor until the last smallest supporting role was cast perfectly and contributed to this film.Bardo reads like a poem, as Inarritu speaks in metaphors one more beautiful and thoughtful than the other. It's layered, complex, absurd, dreamlike, moving, breathtakingly beautiful, visionary and ambitious - one of the best films I've seen in my life and a film which will have a place in my heart for a very long time.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTBjNWFjOTEtMzZlNy00NDA1LTkyNmEtYTNhNmVlNjg3OWUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMTg2ODkz._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

As usual, she wrote, directed and acted in it. Among the most impressive aspects is the way the movie combines entertainment and deep reflexions about various overall topics, which is a consistent creative brand of her work. It perfectly fulfills the expectations as an ""Erotic Thriller"", both in terms of eroticism and crime plot, but also explores important topics like aging, voyeurism, erotic fantasies, double dealing, unethical behavior... all at the same time. Interestingly, the movie has some ""European"" undertones in the way it deals freely with nudity while always remaining focused on its core topics.

Racism is using one's own physical traits to establish social superiority over another person, or group of people, who don't look like themselves. I saw nothing of any of the African/Black/persons-of-color trying to ""reverse role play"" by holding themselves in a superior light over so-called ""white people.""It simply wasn't there.Myself, I hate ""white guilt"" messages in media of all forms. I've had enough social agenda thrust in my face. But that's NOT THE MESSAGE of ""Undercover Brother.""What a lot of the ""angry-white-commentators"" are bothered by is the fact that they believe this film makes ALL so-called ""white persons"" look like evil-clowns, or condescending jerks. IT DOESN'T. If that's what you see in this film, then maybe you shouldn't be watching movies in the first place.This film, as stated clear as day by both cast and crew, is an attempt to tackle a social problem with good humor. If you're offended by the jokes in this film, then you've completely missed the point, and are, in fact, the racist idiot that you claim this film to be (I believe psychologist call this phenomenon ""projection,"" where someone refuses to acknowledge their own faults, and casts their own negative qualities on people they dislike).But to the movie; it was hilarious. Myself, not being black, I couldn't help but laugh of the number of stereotypes this film poked fun at; especially ""Conspiracy Brother"" (played by Dave Chappell), whose loose form of illogic-thinking and one-liners had me, quite literally, falling out of my chair with laughter. And Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser M.D. fame) playing the ""affirmative action"" intern nearly bust my gut, particularly near the end of the film. And Chris Kattan as the evil high energy second in command was just brilliant. The entire cast and film was superb. Think ""Shaft"" meets ""Get Smart"" here. :-)What this film needed was to poke more fun at itself in a more direct manner. In a large sense this film pokes fun at itself in terms of its genre, but I think it also needed to show a couple more stereotypes. One of the great ""high-profile"" stereotypes in white America are black people talking in theaters, or otherwise being loud and obnoxious in places and circumstances ""white"" Americans thinks inappropriate. It would've been nice to see Undercover Brother cleaning up ""his peoples"" stereotypes, but doing so with humor before going after ""the man."" I think that's a thing the film makers missed, because the other thing I believe ""angry white commentators"" are bothered by is the fact that there are ""black"" folks who have their own prejudices, and that this film might seen by that segment of black-America as a green light for ridiculing ""whites."" IT ISN'T.One of the other themes the film makers missed is the coupling that that occurs between Denise Richard's character and Eddie Griffin's character. One of the primary drives of racism is the abhorrence of interracial couples. This plot point, even though it's high comedy, seemed implausible for a racially motivated antagonist. Then again, that may've been part of the film makers' strategy to show how ludicrous racial prejudice is, and can be.The final mistake, and this is more of a minor quibble, but a profound one from a fan of this film, was the downplay of Jim Kelley's role in this film.Where I grew up Jim Kelley was a hero, and this was amongst a circle of friends who were all white. I think the marketing decision to ace Jim Kelley's role in this film was a mistake. Not a huge one, but a mistake nonetheless.If you're still of the opinion that this film is racist (assuming you've read this far and haven't burst a blood vessel), then I would suggest you're taking the film too personally, because the film isn't ridiculing so-called ""white-people,"" but prejudice that, in this case, is assumed by a large chunk of white America. If you think otherwise, then you're not viewing this film with a clear mind.Beyond that, it's one of the funniest films I've ever seen. View it with a relaxed and open mind, and enjoy some of the biggest laughs to ever hit the big screen.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBjODAzZDItZGY5My00YWMyLWE5NDItZGUyNTI2MWZkYTUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

While the philosophical ideas in the original work are fascinating, the film version fails to capture the essence of the text. Instead, the film creates a badly theatrical style that is always over-explaining jokes and making edgy commentary. This is a shame because the philosopher is portrayed extremely badly in the film, and his ideas are not given the attention they deserve.I had the opportunity to watch this film during its premier week at the Berlinale festival, and unfortunately, many people left before the film ended due to how bad it was. While the idea of adapting Seneca's work for the big screen is admirable, this particular attempt falls short of expectations. The film fails to convey the beauty and depth of the original work, and instead opts for a style that tries too hard to be clever and edgy.In conclusion, while the film adaptation of Seneca's ""On the Creation of Earthquakes"" has its merits, the overall execution leaves much to be desired. The badly theatrical style, combined with the over-explaining of jokes and edgy commentary, detract from the philosophical ideas that are at the core of the original work.

Fondas embracing the enemy and Voights devout pacifism have both been well-documented, so there's no need to elaborate. Don't let this cause you to avoid this film. Many veterans were on hand for the filming, and they saw that they were taking part in something special. If they can draw a truce with Fonda, than you can as well. The opening scene sets a tone for the film that it never veers from. A group of disabled vets play pool, and directly confront each other over why they were there, and what it all means. Director Hal Ashby (RIP) pulls no punches here. These vets aren't scholars debating on MacNeil-Lehrer. They struggle with these questions. They don't have the fancy initials after their names that impress people so much. There just the real people that fought the war.The rest of the film follows on this point. Special care goes into each character.Voights Luke Martin went to war to impress girls and feed his titanic ego. Because Ashby and his writers (Waldo Salt, Robert C. Jones and Nancy Dowd) didn't back off on showing Luke's bad side, it makes his transformation. He becomes a better person, because he develops the strength to look inside himself.Bruce Dern gives an excellent performance, as well, in what is probably the trickiest part. Derns Bob Hyde is GI all the way, but returns from his first combat detail in a state of turmoil. He sees the insanity first hand and, quite frankly, can't handle it. The nice thing here is that he's not simply disillusioned by the politics of the war, but more by war, itself. It's to this films credit, that they didn't have Dern return home and  do an about face and start protesting. That story has been told. Instead, once again, we see a human being struggling to understand things that may be unknowable. What makes a man cut another man's ears off, and throw them in his knapsack? How are you supposed to feel, when your fellow soldiers are boiling the flesh off a human skull, so they can mount it on a stake?Oddly enough, Fondas character, Sally Hyde, may be the least ""political"" character in the film. Sure, she sees injustices at the VA hospital and gets involved volunteering, but this is merely as a novice. She asks very rudimentary questions about why the vets are being ignored, but she asks as a sympathetic human being, not an activist. As she eventually expands her horizons, she changes from an officer's wife into a more mature woman. As this happens, she falls in love with Voight. Neither person really wants it to happen. Voight doesn't want to betray a fellow soldier. Fonda doesn't want to betray her loyal husband. No easy answer.It's a shame that ""Coming Home"" occupies such a small niche in film history. It's a quiet, thoughtful film that patiently tells its story. It doesn't have a single battle scene, but it remains incredibly powerful. Robert Carradines breakdown while he plays his guitar and sings, is a scene that should be taught in film school. Just one moment in an incredible film. Don't let this gem fade away.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTZmMmE4YWQtNjhkYi00NGM0LWI4YTQtZjk2ZTJkNWE1MjVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

As a director, Mr. Allen has always done well. Of course, there are exceptions, but in ""Bullets over Broadway"" show an inspired Mr. Allen doing what he does best. This comedy, written in collaboration with Douglas McGrath, is a happy take on a situation that only this director would have been able to create.We are shown two different worlds. In one, the roaring twenties gangsters have the control of all illegal activities in Manhattan. On the other, we meet an idealistic writer, David Shayne, who wants to have his play produced. Enter the capo Nick Valenti. This man has enough money to buy his current paramour, the dizzy Olive Neal, whatever her little heart desires. Thus, the vehicle chosen is the drama David has written.Thus begins a frantic comedy of errors where the theater and the mob intermingle with funny results. We watch as the play gets produced on Broadway how the different factions come together, each one with a different idea as to what to do with the play.The cast is first rate. John Cusack, as the ambitious playwright, does some of his best work in showing what this man is going through. Dianne Wiest, one of the most accomplished actresses around, makes a splash with her take on Helen Sinclair, the first lady of the American theatah! Jennifer Tully is excellent as Olive Neal, the girl from the provinces with high aspirations, but no talent.Chaz Palmintieri, as Cheech, the mobster that understands what's wrong with the play is hilarious. The late Joe Venturelli was born to play his mobster Nick Valente. Jack Warden is perfect as the producer. Tracey Ullman and Jim Broadbent are simply marvelous as the cast members of the play in production. Mary Louise Parker and Harvey Fierstein, Rob Reiner are also seen in smaller roles.""Bullets over Broadway"", as most of Mr. Allen's films has a great musical score of the jazz songs of the era.

First things first. Just as director Tom Vaughan did in introducing the film, let's get the explanation of the title out of the way. The plot centers around a group of university students competing on ""University Challenge,"" a popular UK quiz show in which the host begins by announcing, ""Starter for Ten..."" The American equivalent would be, ""I'll take Famous Armadillos for 20, Alex."" Now that we're set in place, let's get set in time.This is a period piece -- 1985, to be exact. And make no mistake about it -- the filmmakers went all out to recreate the mid-80's -- sets, costumes, hair and, most importantly (for this writer, anyway) the music. And oh, what great songs. That had me from the word ""go."" Finally, we need a protagonist. One who is captivating enough to command 90 minutes of our time. And this is, perhaps, the crowning achievement of this film. His name is James McAvoy, and he had no less than three films screening in Toronto this year. Talk about prolific. Though a bit older than the character Brian Jackson, he's convincing as a teenager off to discover himself and of what he is capable, in school, life, and affairs of the heart. He wins us over because he commands the screen and the script, and has the eyes of innocence and vulnerability with which we can all identify. He is everyman -- every boy/man -- and no doubt we see our own coming-of-age through his eyes. Throw all those elements together with a compelling love story and you have a formula for success. I asked McAvoy after the screening what his most difficult scene was. Without giving anything away, I'll just say that he becomes emotional at times, and quite convincingly. He told me that he had to keep reminding himself that it was Brian who was sad, not James. That's powerful stuff. This is a sweet, moving film which left me wanting more. I'll take ""Starter for Ten,"" and I think you will, too.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MTE3OTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA1NzA0MQ@@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

She leaves him, and one day, she meets a young man, and they fall in love. Fate brings the husband together with the young lover that has taken Eva from him.","34","The world's first glimpse of a 19 year-old Hedy Lamarr...","Ecstasy (1933) (USA 1940) Starring Hedy Lamarr (as Hedy Kiesler)The world's first glimpse of a 19 year-old Hedy Lamarr occurs in the early moments of this 1930's treasure as she sweeps across the screen in an angelic wedding gown. This was to be the start of a legendary career. This was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen.It is Eva's (Lamarr) wedding night and her older husband seems uninterested in her romantic advances. She retreats to the lonely bed and, in a beautiful scene, she fiddles with her wedding ring as the realization of her marital mistake overcomes her. The husband seems more interested in neatness and order than he does in love. Gustav Machaty uses gorgeous camera angles and pristine shot framing to capture Lamarr's considerable talent and beauty. With no words spoken in the early part of the film, she is able to grasp our sympathy, our hearts and our support. It is that combination that prepared the 1930's audiences for what they were about to see as the film unfolded. 'Ecstasy' was considered shocking for its time... Some thought it to be scandalous.She returns home to her father's estate and files for divorce. The next day, she wakes with a complete sense of freedom and happiness. She just has to go outside and feel the freedom of the countryside and fresh air. Eva goes for a horseback ride and happens across a beautiful lake. And in one of the most famous scenes in film history, Hedy Lamarr became the first person to ever appear nude in a major film. Her frolic in the woods and her skinny-dipping adventure in the lake were legendarily scandalous. But the audiences couldn't stay away. As with many of today's movies, the controversy made it a must-see film.Eva's mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse, who had run off with her clothes. After an awkward meeting, they eventually fall for each other. Their first romantic rendezvous was almost as controversial as the nude scene, with its blatant waves of eroticism. However, Machaty does beautiful work in these romantic moments. Machaty creates one delightful moment, when Eva literally seems to sink into her new lover, using a gorgeous early camera trick.It cannot be overstated how brave this performance was on Lamarr's part. Many might have presumed it was career suicide. Instead, it gained her worldwide fame and caught the eye Louis B Mayer, who signed her to a contract with MGM. There are some truly erotic moments in this film, even by today's raunchy standards. It is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930's. Again, Machaty was very clever with his imagery, leaving a lot to the imagination. But we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is supremely well done.The meeting of Eva's former husband and her current lover is perhaps inevitable. However, the consequences of that meeting are not. The film takes a few unexpected turns in its final act and it all makes for a great story and a lovely debut on the grand stage of movie stardom for Hedy Lamarr.I highly recommend this once controversial, now tame film and urge you to seek it out in its restored form on DVD. It is easily worthwhile, if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr. But the story is compelling too and the direction is ahead of its time. 'Ecstasy' is a memorable early treasure.www.tccandler.com - TC Candler's Movie Reviews!!!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3MTA0ODU4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQ3OTMyMQ@@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

"Vortex","2013.0","","142.0","Drama","7.4","82.0","Gaspar NoÃÂ©","Dario Argento, FranÃÂ§oise Lebrun, Alex Lutz, Kylian Dheret","9,318","The last days of an elderly couple stricken by dementia.","25","""La mort n'ouvre aucune porte""","I had the opportunity of seeing Gaspar's newest film at the 74th Cannes Film Festival this year. Being an admirer of his entire filmmography as well as one of my favorite working directors, I was very much excited to see this premiere. I knew close to nothing about it, but the poster and title seemed to offer somerthing both different and promising.And I think we will all agree this is different. I was expecting a new version of ""Enter The Void"" this time dealing with old age instead of DMT, but this wasn't the case at all. This film isn't exactly completely new territory for Gaspar, but it's the first time he lazer focuses on making an emotional impact mainly through his actor's performances. In so many of his other works, his directing style is bold and brash, making use of several filmmaking techniques to match the style of his films in accordance with their substance. In ""IrrÃÂ©versible"", he filmed every scene in one take to add a sense of immersion and show both the ugly and the beauty of the events with little artifice. He also showed the events backwards, to add to the theme of time being the ultimate destructor. In ""Enter The Void"", he used POV shots and special effects to make the camera go through walls, in ""I Stand Alone"" he made great use of transitions between shots etc...All of his previous films have had something to do with violence, drugs, sex, trauma, the human condition, time and death. His cinema now has the reputation for being intensely extreme, filled with shocking content and insane stories offering one-of-a-kind experiences for the viewer. And although this film is definetly a Gaspar NoÃÂ© film, it truly doesn't fit in neatly with the rest of his filmmography.Forget all the neon lights and the stroboscoping effects, forget the explicit sex scenes. Forget the hallucinogenic escapades and the nightmarish parties. This film deals with an aging couple comming to terms with their deaths and the impending doom that awaits them. In short, it's a film about old age, dementia and death. The first 20 minutes or so will clearly set the tone for the rest of the film, as they are almost completely silent, long takes of the two characters waking up and starting their day while someone on the radio explains the ways in which people cope with death and the meaning behind how we deal with grief.There are still traces of Gaspar's filmmaking, most notably in his signature transitions using a black screen for one second between some shots, as well as the decision to have the entire film happen in split screen. According to him, this choice was to showcast the character's different expriences happenning at the same time, since, to quote from ""I Stand Alone"" : ""we are born alone, we live alone, we die alone. Alone with your flesh, alone with your life which is like a tunnel that's impossible to share"". Here, the split screen serves as a way of constantly reminding the spectator of this ""tunnel"".However, these are the main two stylistic choices and the rest of the film rests entirely on the shoulders of the actors to carry the emotions in every scene, especially with a subject matter this bleak. When it comes to this, every one of them did their job perfectly (especially FranÃÂ§oise Lebrun), allowing for some of the most tragic, personnal and saddest moments in Gaspar's entire career. Never before had we felt this level of intimacy in so many scenes. You could find similar moments in ""I Stand Alone"" with the father/daughter relationship or the brother and sister love in ""Enter The Void"". Here, these moments are the core of the film, and when they come, they sure do it their mark.However, there is one major problem I had with this film, which is something I have said about some of his other films, notably ""Enter The Void"" : it's just way too damn long. So many scenes and sequences drag out for minutes without any noticeable action or involvement. The characters are seen in their daily life and we are shown the incidents that come with living with somebody's dementia, notably Alzheimer's. As I've mentionned before, the film begins with very long takes of those daily actions, and how FranÃÂ§oise Lebrun's character copes (or rather how she fails to cope) with her disease. This goes on for the entire film, and the only moments breaking from this excrutiatingly slow pacing are the scenes of dialogue between the couple and their son, played by Alex Lutz. These scenes are incredibly well acted, and just like most of Gaspar's films, they were mostly improvised and you can tell. This felt right, since it adds to the sense of naturalism the film was clearly going for.Unfortunately, I think the film falls short of greatness because of this. This reminded me of two other films : the first one is ""Amour"" by Michael Haneke for obvious reasons, but Haneke's style seemed more fit to tackle this topic in this manner. The second one is David Lowery's ""A Ghost Story"", which deals with grief and most notably, explores death and how we cope with it from an existential point of view. In ""Vortex"", Gaspar also explores these themes, but with a 2h20min runtime, he bores and eventually loses the spectator before the film's final minutes can truly have an impact.I still enjoyed it for what it tried to be, and for the performences. It's also very refreshing to see a more personnal film from Gaspar, away from his usual reputation and for the first time without an R or NC-17 rating. But I simply cannot put aside how long this film seemed. Just like with ""IrrÃÂ©versible"", he wrote a 10-page script and ended up with a 2 hour film, which is one of his shortcomings. I will probably watch it again sometime, when I'll really be in the mood for this again, and maybe I'll give it a 7 instead of a 6 after a few more viewings. But for now, this will definitely not be his masterpiece.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjMxYTFmNTctNDgyYi00NzQwLTk1NTItMmVkYjk5Yjc1NmI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAyMjQ3NzQ1._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Soon she is swept up in their lives and finds herself on the run from the FBI.This is the best performance I've ever seen by Pfeiffer. She is practically unrecognizable--her southern accent is perfect and her Jackie O-inspired look is classic. She adds a welcome dose of humor to a film that is often emotionally overwhelming. The movie alternates between adorable and disturbing, but never gets too extreme either way. The plot gets a bit contrived at times, but the movie serves to question the comfort of routine middle-class existence, so it works. I am surprised this is not a well-known film.

The Door In The Floor gives Bridges a chance to create a character truly worthy of his subtle (and generally overlooked) brilliance; his organic, from-the-inside-out approach makes what he does seem so effortless, so thoroughly not-like-acting that he's generally hardly given his due, and if he doesn't garner some serious recognition for what he brings to the table here, there's quite simply no hope for the world.This is a film of deep, devastating power - a film where you, as an audience member, actually share space with the two main characters, Ted and Marion Cole (Bridges, of course, and an equally-brilliant Kim Bassinger, who once again reminds us why she won an Oscar a few years back).  We inhabit their crumbled world, from the inside, not just as observers.

I live in NYC and it's was nice to see the Pan Am Building in the backdrop. It's now the Met Life building. The Pan Am building was also the location of the final scene where the helicopter takes off. The other reason I like this movie is that Eastwood is essentially playing Dirty Harry before Dirty Harry. Coogan is just like Harry Calahan without the 44. magnum. The story is solid but it's the locales and the  situations that Coogan finds himself in that sell the movie. Who cares of it's dated? Of course it's dated but that's part of the experience. Actually most movies made more than 20 years ago (or less) are dated.

There's some decent action sequences, but sadly, most are overshadowed by Grevioux's horrible cinematography choices. I don't mind bold colors and high contrast to make a film feel animated in a comic book sort of way, but when you dial down the brightness, all a viewer sees are paint color splashes amongst shadowy backgrounds. Even the daylight scenes were too dark. This is amateur-hour filmmaking and makes for a frustrating viewer experience. Then you have his screenplay which is a knock-off of every assassin movie ever made, that was predictable, convoluted, cliched and generic. The normally comfortable 92 min runtime felt never ending with unnecessary sub-plots and ridiculous side-characters. Aside from the decent twist and best action parts towards the ending, the rest of the main narrative was repetitive, exhausting, unimaginative and dull. It's a generous 4/10 all going to Grillo's excellent and best performance of all the characters, albeit he deserves to be in much better films instead of these bottom bin B-films.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUxMzVlYzUtMDRjYS00N2ZlLWE1NDItMzc0NWEyNjdiNTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM2NDM2MQ@@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The Railway Man is a reminder of the madness of war that reached beyond those well-known battle fields and the profound effects it had on individuals who fought in the Southeast Asia region.Colin Firth embodies the suffering of Eric Lomax, a veteran who still experiences post-traumatic nightmares decades after the war. Nicole Kidman plays his wife Patti with utmost grace and compassion, and Stellan SkarsgÃÂ¥rd's portrayal is nothing short of perfection as he plays the fellow veteran who is also torn by his friend's immeasurable pain. Rounding out the strong performances is Hiroyuki Sanada's Nagase, a former translator of the Imperial Japanese Army who took considerable part in Eric's torture.While the flashback scenes led by younger actors (Jeremy Irvine and Tanroh Ishida) could use some improvements, the current post-war scenes are recreated to near perfection with mature performances from the more experienced cast members. It is also noteworthy that the film does not hesitate for a moment to refute the wrong notion associated with ""tragedy of war,"" a term often misused to make a war sound as if it were a mere chance event and not a product of malice. The film makes it clear the pain inflicted upon Eric Lomax is nothing but an act of crime, and from that accord comes an unusual relationship between two former enemies that only a film based on a true account can deliver.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDU1NjE0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA3NDczMDE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"
"Ecologia del delitto","2013.0","","84.0","Horror, Mystery, Thriller","6.5","","Mario Bava","Claudine Auger, Luigi Pistilli, Claudio Camaso, Anna Maria Rosati","12,757","The murder of a wealthy countess triggers a chain reaction of brutal killings in the surrounding bay area, as several unscrupulous characters try to seize her large estate.","108","Brilliant!","BAY OF BLOOD (or TWITCH OF THE DEATH NEVER) is a brilliant film. The idea behind it is original and it's still a one-of-a-kind flick, even if the movie itself inspired a gazillion slashers. Regarded as the granddaddy of slashers, BAY OF BLOOD has a unique concept behind it that none of its duplicators have successfully copied: the concept of people being murdered one by one, not by just one killer but by several killers, in very gruesome ways, all in the name of super dry, jet black comedy. There's something surprisingly stealthy about Mario Bava's approach to the deliberately confusing story. Throughout the labirynth like story-line, we bounce from one character to the next, never having enough time to get to know the people in the movie to care enough for them and when they are killed, their deaths suddenly take a surprisingly modern twist. Unlike most slashers out there, like FRIDAY THE 13TH or even HALLOWEEN and their endless sequels, many critics have said that in order for the horror element in those movies to work, you have to care about the people getting killed. Many critics have dismissed the whole slasher genre just on that basis: the films are not horrifying because the people getting killed either deserve it because they're annoying or the acting was really bad, or just because the writing was terrible and the characters were just token characters and it's not scary to see token, cardboard characters getting killed. Well, in BAY OF BLOOD, the ingeniously scripted story transcends this. The characters in BOB are not really deep or even memorable but their introduction to us, the viewer, is so quick and their deaths are so gruesome and so sudden and unexpected that the fact we know little about them hardly matters. It hardly matters because the killings aren't being made by a single killer with a singular reason but by several killers, whom all have a confusing number of reasons (which can all be traced to greed), with few of the killers knowing that others are also killing other people at the same time and as the film progresses, the killers, in turn, also become victims themselves. This is the brilliant aspect of BOB. People just kill each other left and right in a neverending succession of blood and violence, each people completely indifferent to each other. Watching this made me giggle and wince. The story cannibalises itself repeatedly, every ten minutes or so, snowballing into an all-out blood bath. The effect this creates is like being trapped inside a time-loop, in which the same thing happens over and over AND over again. Combine this with the fact that the story's actions happens mostly within a brief time-line (except for the beginning, everything happens on the same day) BUT that it also goes back and forth in time, with flashbacks and such, and BOB, oddly enough never feels grounded to one specific time. The killings in BOB feel different than anything I've ever seen in a horror film. Each killing is seemingly detached from the story itself and the film takes an all new unique approach, as the deaths come to the fore while the rest fades in the background. It almost feels like we're watching the killings happen ""live"". There isn't a single lone female survivor, or a surprise ending like most horror films (there is a surprise ending in BAY OF BLOOD but it's not a killer coming back to life).The acting is good but the cast is mostly anonymous (deliberate?). Except for Claudine Auger, the rest of the cast seemingly all meld together. The location and sets were also good. Only the music was inappropriate at times and the cinematography was sometimes annoying, with Bava's constant use of out-of-focus shots, which I don't like at all. My favorite scene in BOB is the one when Claudine Auger goes to the bathroom. Arf!!! Though I consider BAY OF BLOOD to be brilliant, the film is dated and there's a certain aloofness to it that even if it serves the story to a certain extent, this aloofness is carried to an  unfortunate extreme which makes the film feel not as ""passionate"" as it could have been or should have been. I guess aloofness is a Bava trademark, which is one of the reasons why I'm not a big Bava fan. Except for HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON, I've haven't been impressed by most of his films. Well, BAY OF BLOOD has impressed me a lot and I have to say that it's probably my favorite Mario Bava film, along with HATCHET. All in all, I think BAY OF BLOOD is a unique, one-of-a-kind gruesome movie. Anyone who didn't like it just didn't get it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmYyZjA1MTQtY2YwMi00NjUwLTkwYjEtMmQ0YjUxZmI5ZDk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

""Bandits"" starts out as a slick action-comedy and evolves into a sweet romantic comedy.  When I found out Barry Levinson was the director, I assumed the film would be at least halfway decent.  Levinson has a keen eye for character development, and that's one of the things that interested me.  Normally, a film like this would be consisted of cut-and-dry, stereotypical characters, but we gradually fall in love these three characters.  After reading the rave reviews (Joel Siegel voted this as one of the best films of the year), despite poor box office numbers, I had high expectations for this film--higher than they were after watching the trailer.  For some reason, this just doesn't look like a film that would receive 4-star reviews.  Now that I have seen it, I can't regard it as a 4-star film, but it's good and entertaining and I wasn't disappointed.  Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton make a great team--they really have an impeccable chemistry.  I hope to see them teamed up again in the future. They have the potential to be the next Martin and Lewis.  Billy Bob especially steals the film, playing a neurotic Woody Allen-type.  He is absolutely hilarious!  Bruce flashes his trademark grin and speaks in his usual soft tone, but his role doesn't exactly require the talents of Pacino or DeNiro.  Still, Bruce is entertaining and his constant banter with Billy Bob makes the experience even more entertaining.  And last but not least, I will mention Cate Blanchett, who gives another incredible performance.  I was lucky enough to rent 2 Cate Blanchett movies--this film and ""The Gift""--by coincidence.  I got to see her sweet, charming performance in ""Bandits"" as well as her powerful dramatic performance in ""The Gift.""  Just watching those 2 films, gives me a great idea of her scope as an actress. It's sometimes hard to believe she's an Australian actress.  How she pulls off such an impeccable American accent--I don't know.  I think if I were to hear her speak in an Australian accent, I'd think she's feigning it.  Well, Blanchett perfectly completes the trio of actors, and has a great chemistry with the 2 male leads.  And it's great to see that Willis, Thornton and Blanchett all seem like they're having fun.  When first watching this movie, I found some of the bank robberies--though very slick and original--to be quite implausible.  If the film wasn't as charming and likable, I'd probably have a difficult time suspending disbelief.  But then I found out the story of the ""Sleepover Bandits"" was actually based on a real duo of bank robbers.  Of course, this is nowhere close to a biopic and most of the story is obviously fiction, the concept of these two guys sleeping over the bank managers' houses and robbing their banks the next morning was based on truth.  Why these managers didn't call the cops while the two guys weren't watching or why they didn't try to strangle the two guys in their sleep--I don't know.  The truth really is stranger than fiction.  But the bandits did have an interesting gimmick: they only robbed banks, since the money belonged to the government; they never snatched money from people's pockets.  There's actually a scene in the movie in which they bust out of prison and rob a lady's car.  Willis hands the lady her pocketbook and says, ""Don't forget your pocketbook.""   The film evolves into a romantic comedy during the second half.  I guess that's why audiences were disappointed--they probably expected a sheer action-comedy/crime caper and not a romantic comedy.  But I think the fact that the screenwriter and Levinson stretched this out into a romantic comedy made it all the more better.  It added new dimensions, and helped us better fall in love with these amiable characters.  It was fun watching the strong and macho Willis vie lanky pushover Thornton over the love of alluring Blanchett.  It creates an interesting conflict, and spawns some very funny scenes.  The film concludes, picking up from where it left off in the beginning--which is the two bandits pulling off their last bank robbery. The twist ending is nifty and unpredictable, and left me satisfied.  Though this is basically a feel-good comedy that kept me smiling, there's no cheap schmaltz or trashy sentiment.  That's what happens when you're under the wing of a great director.  This is not an excellent film, like some critics said--I don't think any movie that contains Blanchett's horrible rendition of ""Walk on By"" deserves to be regarded as ""excellent"" (Cate should DEFINITELY stick to acting!)--but it's good, solid entertainment.  And I love the use of U2's ""Beautiful Day""!My score:  7 (out of 10)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMzA3OTI3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjU0ODM3._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It has degrees of suspense, and passable acting (perhaps most surprisingly by Christopher Reeve in his last performance prior to his paralysis), but these qualities are inconsistent throughout the film and it frequently falls flat.If you've seen the original film then avoid this one, especially if you have read Whyndam's novel too, you will only come away from the experience with a sense of disappointment and feel cheated of the time you invested in watching it. This film lacks many things that the original had - great and consistent acting, tension, and suspense to name but three.There seems to have been a conscious effort to add gore and violence, and that decision is perhaps the main reason this film fails so miserably compared to the original. The gratuitously graphic nature of the violence directly detracts from the suspense and tension so evident in the original. Whereas in another carpenter remake 'The Thing' the effects and violence enhanced the sense of dread, here they are responsible for destroying it.There are other reasons that this film is quite dire, one of them being the narrative compromises made to attempt a recreation of the visual style of the original film e.g. the children all wear matching clothes which, in the original, was logical since in England children do indeed wear school uniforms. However Carpenter's US town sees the children uniformly garbed with no reason, other than to draw attention to their uniformity in a massively clumsy and illogical visual device.Take my advice, watch the original and avoid this. It's one strictly for carpenter fanatics, not people who are simply fans of his work.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGZiNjQyOGUtNjQ2Ny00MzUxLWI1NDUtMDNlMjBiNjcwMTNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

On one hand, he's a wonderfully loving father of two sweet girls (one played by his actual daughter, and played well), and yet he is a weak man when it comes to prostitutes. But, whatever side he shows - light or dark - he's interesting, as always. So is the female star of this movie, Genevieve Bujold, a woman with a very intriguing face and just a trace of her French accent.

It has long been clear to me why ""Ryan's Daughter"" was so poorly received.  After Lean's previous epics, everyone was certain that, with all the time and money that went into this film, and with its lengthy running time, it would simply have to be a similar type of show.  When people bring such expectations to a movie and are confronted with something so daringly different, they often focus on what they didn't see and miss the virtue of the picture they saw.  This film is too ""slow"", too absorbed with the subtle dynamics of the interaction between its characters for a viewer who is burning to see vast battle scenes, mighty parades and mobs of extras caught up in violent historical struggles.  The ""spectacle"" in this film (and spectacle it is indeed) comes from the exquisite widescreen lensing of stunning Irish coastal scenery. The fabulous storm sequence with villagers battling raging surf in their efforts to retrieve floating contraband is, in my opinion, unmatched in all the thousands of movies I have seen.  The drama of the central characters' lives and the depiction of the way the eternal conflicts that continue to trouble their nation work to destroy normal existence for them....this all works for me.  I guess there are going to be many who just can't buy into the whole thing, but I can only feel sorry for them.  To me, Lean did create an epic here, but not the traditional kind that everyone came to see.  It is a ""feast-for-the-eyes"", intimate epic of the tumultuous emotional life of a little village caught in a swirl of hatred, suspicion, prejudice and seething conflict with an occupying army.  One of my dearest hopes is that I may live to see a handsome DVD release of this splendid masterpiece before too much more time elapses. It should NEVER be viewed in some pan-and-scan edition on an ordinary TV!  Seen this way with all that glorious cinematography cropped and miniaturized, ""Ryan's Daughter"" could indeed be seen as a failure.  I always wonder how many magnificent David Lean films we will never see as a result of the unproductive years that resulted from the crushing effect on the director of the widespread rejection of this wonderful creation.

With the exception of Stewart and Novak, the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought this was ironic because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me. It was hard to get me to a movie that didn't include horses, machine guns, or alien monsters and I planned on being bored. But, I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground. As the glorious George Duning love theme soared, I suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to fall in love. The first stirrings of romantic/sexual love left me dazed as I left the theater. I am sure I'm not the only pre-adolescent boy who was seduced by Kim Novak's startling, direct gaze. It's ironic that a gay parable was able to jump-start heterosexual puberty in so many of us.

When at a press conference a journalist asks him ""Who's Johnny Marko"" he is unable to respond. Johnny is someone (or is he?) but he doesn't really know who. The relationships he has with people are far from personal.From what we see at the beginning of the movie we would probably think Johnny is the usual single good looking but empty inside actor and that he pretty much has been all his life. But when his daughter shows up the picture is different: a failed marriage behind him... could this have made him what he is? maybe. As he welcomes Cleo back in his life she somehow seems to fill the emptiness of the environment around him. Nothing particularly overwhelming, just the little things that make the difference. Does this movie display emotion in an explicit and clearly visible way? No. The dialog between characters is not what makes the difference. It's the feelings that make us think we're going somewhere or instead that we are so disconnected we can't care less where we are going. The feelings you can't really put into words (as properly emphasized in ""Lost in Translation""). Just like the latter, ""Somewhere"" shows life as it is, no astonishing happenings, not many life changing experiences and maybe this is what will make a lot of people walk out of the theater unsatisfied or bored. We usually go to the cinema to evade from reality, see relationships develop clearly as they drastically change the lives of those involved in them. But this is not the case: just like in our lives things slowly develop and maybe over time change the way we see the world or feel the world. Maybe as the film suggests at one point, we need to slow down and take a look at where we are going instead of just passing through. ""Somewhere"" is a particular movie from a particular director/writer. I can't go ahead and say watch this movie, you will love it, because it isn't for everyone but this is not a good enough reason to not give it a try altogether.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1MzE1NDA0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODM2MDY1Mw@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The effect is palpable: you just can't fake being a real person. This of course is the familiar story of an American boy in the 1880's who learns he is the heir to an English earl and must go live with the old bloke, who parenthetically hates his mother, in an old castle. Needless to say, it is the earl who is transformed by the strength and purity of the boy's character, and not the intended reverse.

It is my fourth favorite best underrated Van Damme movie. This movie is really underrated, but it is one of my best favorite prison style movies. Also my favorite childhood movie that I still watch today, like other Van Damme action movies I do. The action fighting sequences are awesome. Sylvester Stallone made an action Drama movie Lock Up in 1989 and Jean-Claude Van Damme made Death Warrant a year later in 1990. Directed by Deran Sarafian and written by a David S. Goyer who at the time was a college student and it was his first script. Cynthia Gibb is awesome as co star alongside Van Damme. The movie is awesome another adrenaline action packed movie I also love the music score: Bring Me a Dream by Craig Thomas, which I am still listening today.""Bring me a dream Burke"".This movie to me is a kicks-ass, Patrick Kilpatrick as The Sandman was a bad ass villain on screen, I have ever seen. This movie is also a horror film and get's scary, when you see the prison place and the murders of the doctor and the prison inmates inside those cells. When prisoners brake loose was really scary. I love loved the prison movies, about prison inmates, it was, one the reason why I love Prison Break (2005) and why it become my favorite TV Show! This movie is a kick ass and it will always be forever my favorite Van Damme movie that I love it to death! "" Don 'The Dragon' Wilson (Bloodfist) and David Bradley (American Ninja 3) the action stars from the 80's and 90's both ripped off Van Damme movies! Like Bloodfist 1 ripped off the story from Bloodsport, Bloodfist 2 ripped off the story from Kickboxer and Bloodfist 3 ripped off the story from Death Warrant! And Don Wilson was praising him self that, he could beat Van Damme to a pulp?! I don't think so! David Bradley's Hard Justice (1995) ripped off the story from John Woo's Hard Boiled (even the title they stole), Bloodfist III: Forced to Fight and Death Warrant! That movie copied and stole everything from those three movies. That is the thing I had a problems in the 90's, they could have been all creative and not copy someone else's movies work! Even Jerry Trimble - Live by the Fist (1993) ripped off Bloodfist III: Forced to Fight. I know they were all different movies, but they copied and ripped off the story from Death Warrant geesh! I want to point this out! That's fine by me, if you read my review and you don't agree, but that is me.Attila from Lionheart and Sandman in here Death Warrant fights comes very close. The movie is filled with action and the inside of the prisons is great. The cells are also great. This is the first time Jean-Claude Van Damme played a Canadian, the second time he played a Canadian was in Sudden Death (1995). I always enjoyed Death warrant and like I mentioned before it is my fourth favorite best Van Damme Movie. The other three are Hard Target, Bloodsport and Universal Soldier than is Death Warrant. It's part of that first generation of JCVD films (Bloodsport, Cyborg, Kickboxer, Death Warrant, and Double Impact) before the biggest budget film he was part of (Universal Soldier). I love Jean-Claude Van Damme and I am a big fan of him. I grew up watching, his old movies and other kids including me grew up too watching his movies. Bolo Yeung, Michel Qissi, Abdel Qissi and Patrick Kilpatrick where great villains in Van Damme movies. Cynthia Gibb was also awesome she played in Youngblood (1986) in the 80's another my favorite all time sports film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM5OTVkMDEtZWU1ZS00ODExLWE0MjktNDE4MTQ5NDk2NmMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDc2NjEyMw@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Charlie Hunnam is gorgeous and capable as Nicholas, and herein lies the problem.  While not for the youngest of kids, those 12 and up would probably enjoy the movie very much.  As a way to touch Dickens, this is easily the least painful and most accessible for 7th through 12th graders.  Why aren't audience was filled with 40 and 50 somethings who read the novel growing up and a few (like me) brought teenagers with them.  My daughter and her friends loved it!  Very frustrating that studios will sink millions into drawing crowds for trash like ""Planet of the Apes"", ""XXX"", ""Blue Crush"", etc but almost nothing into this.  Of course, this offers an education in story structure and the supporting casting was inspired.  In addition to Hunnam, Anne Hathaway (""Princess Diaries""), Jamie Bell (""Billy Elliot""), Nathan Lane and Alan Cumming were all excellent.  Tom Courtenay was funny and pitiful at the same time.  Yes, the story is like much of Dickens, it provides hope for those who seem to have little.  Good prevails over evil.

Ferreri's greatest achievement was making relentlessly intellectual films that also managed to entertain. While many other European directors could get caught up in their own genius, Marco Ferreri was never pretentious enough to forget about his audience.La Grande Bouffe is one of Ferreri's best and most notorious films. The premise is infamous, four friends gather at a country mansion with the intention of literally eating themselves to death. When this becomes tiresome they hire three prostitutes and invite the local school teacher to join them. This is not a film that follows a linear narrative, instead it expertly crafts a sense of atmosphere from a series of acutely observed vignettes. There are enough unforgettable images and surreal happenings in this film to make Salvador Dali green with envy. The meat garden, Andrea and Michel's flatulent love making and Philippe's relationship with his nanny are just three that come to mind. There is genius at work here, this is not an exercise in empty symbolism but a disturbing slice of modern life.The impact of La Grande Bouffe has not wearied with age. The sex scenes are possibly less confronting (although Marcello's inventive use of a champagne bottle still raises eyebrows) but the film's psychological impact has not been dulled. The characters' ruthless pursuit of death is all the more disturbing given their unadulterated appreciation for life's pleasures. For a film with such disturbing content, La Grande Bouffe is also effortlessly entertaining. Ferreri somehow manages to balance the building tension with black humour, raunchy sex scenes and even budding romance.This is probably a good time to mention the cast. Ferreri has gathered together a who's who of European cinema. Ferreri regulars like Mastroianni and Tognazzi combine brilliantly with French heavyweights like Piccoli and Noiret. Andrea Ferreol more than matches it with these acting giants. She deserves significant credit for her illuminating performance as the open minded school teacher with the appetite of a blue whale.La Grande Bouffe is intelligent, disturbing and unrelenting. Most importantly, it is also entirely non-judgemental. Ferreri would never insult his audience by suggesting to them what they should think. If only more modern directors had taken note.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2JiYWYzYjgtYWY5Ni00M2VmLWI3ZjktNjRlYzZiMTkwZTc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIzNDU1NTY@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Filled with indelible images: The peacock in the middle of the snow, the awesome vision of the ocean liner--and the blind man crying out: ""What's it like, what's it like?"", the belly-laugh inducing introduction to each of the instructors at school, the beautiful people, the grotesques. Like life itself, the movie can be perplexing and enigmatic, sometimes magical, sometimes, in the face of the political climate and history, frightening as ""simple people just trying to live get caught up in the times they were themselves creating"". I don't think any film I've ever seen has so completely captured with such profound insight and simplicity the experience of losing a parent: The visit by the father and son in the hospital in which the mother realizes the awesome finality about to approach, and the son is blissfully unaware in his adolescent ""immortality"", and the total feeling of quiet and emptiness as the father sits at the dining room table, formerly filled with joyful, loud, noisy life--now emptier than could have ever been imagined before--this whole sequence comes as a powerful conclusion to a stunning film. With a final coda a la 8 1/2, Fellini embraces the audience, telling them not to worry--memories go on, life goes on, changed, altered forever perhaps, but it goes on, beautifully, enigmatically, magically.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTUyYTBkZTgtZTg4MC00MjIzLWJjZDgtN2M4YWRkNGY5MDlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Prequel? Hard to tell, but it has some laughs","The germination of the ""Pink Panther"" series of comedic mystery films is a complicated one. The first film in the series, ""The Pink Panther"", was actually the second one to be filmed! This film, ""A Shot in the Dark"", was originally intended to be the adaptation of a stage play, but director Edwards and actor Sellers refit the main character to accommodate the persona of Inspector Clouseu, which they were developing for ""The Pink Panther"". However, when the film was completed, it wasn't released and was deemed unfunny. Then when ""The Pink Panther"" was a hit, the studio released ""A Shot in the Dark"" as a sequel and a series was born. This explains why elements from the first film are absent from the second (Mrs. Clouseu anyone?) and why the second (actually first!) set the tone for the following films more than the first (actually the second! Confused yet?) Here, Sellers is front and center as the hapless and ever-clumsy Inspector. Freed from sharing screen time with a higher billed co-star (David Niven in the previous film) and without a particularly coherent plot to follow, he is allowed to engage in pratfall after pratfall and scenario after goofy scenario. Today's audiences may not completely go for the subtle, meticulously timed method of comedy shown here with emphasis on set up and repetitiveness, but patient and observant audience members should still find the film funny. By now, so much of the material has been cribbed or expanded upon, some of the edge is lost, but enough of the humor and situational gags are amusing enough to make the film worthwhile. Sellers insists upon the innocence of curvy stunner Sommer, a maid who has been found in a locked room with a dead body and a smoking gun in her hand. Time after time, he lets her out of prison and the body count increases. His thorough incompetence drives his superior (Lom) to insanity. Sommer's employer Sanders, a man of great wealth and taste, is also appalled by the bumbling Sellers, never more so than when he manages to practically trash a billiard room during a friendly game. One famous sequence has Sellers tracking Sommer down in a nudist colony. The modest Inspector navigates the idyllic hideaway using any available object to cover himself as the campers frolic behind shrubs and other props. Reed glams it up, but gets little to do as Sanders' bitchy wife. Another memorable sequence has Sellers and Sommer on a date with victim after victim falling prey to an assassin that's after Sellers. It's all a farcical enterprise that one must be in the mood for to fully enjoy. Otherwise, it becomes a little tiresome, but fans of physical comedy ought to lap it up. The remaining sequels were all sort of hybrids of ""The Pink Panther"" mixed with ""A Shot in the Dark"" and had fair success until the death of Sellers made it difficult to continue (but continue they did, using outtakes and other footage of the man! Anything to make a buck!) Henry Mancini provided some nice music, notably over the animated title sequence.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE5Njk1NDQ5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjAyMTMyNA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Having lived in both Sydney and Melbourne, I feel I can say that this will appeal more to the Melbourne than the Sydney sense of humour.Forget ""The Crocodile Hunter"", Nicole Kidman or Russel Crowe. This is a lot closer to your typical Australian.Reading the other comments, two things surprised me.1) That anybody outside Australia, the UK, NZ or Ireland actually got this movie. To those Americans who praised it, thank you for taking the time to appreciate something outside your normal experiences.and2) The ferocity with with those who didn't get it damned the movie.The Castle is very very clever. Yes, there are references to ""wogs"" and ""lebs"", but if given how that's exactly how a large percentage of these ethnic groups refer to themselves, they are terms without power and thus are rarely used in a racist sense. Melbourne is a wog city. It has the largest Greek population outside of Greece and is the third largest Greek city in the world. It also feature a huge population of first, second or third generation Italians. Some of my ex-coworkers sounded like they were straight out the Godfather. Then there are the lebs and the polacks and and a great mix of European Cultures.Wogs. The lot of them. :)To reduce the movie to laughing at the lack of intelligence in the family or to picking on racial minorities (not that the wogs are a minority in Melbourne), is to miss the point entirely. If you don't live in Aus, I can fully understand why this would be the case.But simply because a movie is a outside your understanding or experience or doesn't fit your personal expectations of what is ""funny""  it no reason to condemn it. Once you get more sophisticated than ""Beverly Hills Cop"", you are not going to carry 100% of the audience, and the audience shouldn't expect that it would. (Notable exceptions exist.. Dead Poets' Society immediately comes to mind)Personally, I like movies is one that makes a social comment, or those that a rift in society and stir informed debate. The Castle is a reflection on the ""Australian Dream"", if such a thing exists, which is that everybody should get ""A fair go"".

The subject treated in this movie may not be something new for the viewers but what I am certain of is that director ""Ruffus Norris"" really has a great vision and an amazing ability to capture the audience's complete attention every single second of the film, allowing the movie to drive them. You'll definitely enjoy watching this movie and I assure you, it will be quite an experience. Few movies have succeeded in capturing me to the last frame but Broken is one of them, again, a courtesy of the amazing cinema of England. The movie is based on the concept of causes and consequences that lead to certain actions and results that may be good or bad depending on the situation. It is set in a small neighborhood where the stories of the characters living there intertwine in a beautiful way. It is a story about the loss of innocence, childhood, unfortunate events and people trying to do ""good"", and forced to do ""bad"".Enough said, this film is definitely a must-watch this year.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwOTczNzkwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIyNzE3OQ@@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I saw a bunch of my favorite actors (George C.

The acting is superb, and to be honest, the comic relief was a tad out of place.The movie contains some very good acting and some excellent scenes and dialogue. It also features a heart wrenching monologue by Angus (played by Charlie Talbert) when he confides in his grandfather (George C.

So when I found out the director of the first two Steven R. Monroe wasn't going to be returning I was very disappointed. Wow what a difference a director can make. R.D. Braunstein takes over the helm for the third installment and things just completely fall apart. Admittedly he's been handed an absolute dud of a script by first time screenwriter Daniel Gilboy, but still a better effort than this would have been nice.I was glad to see Sarah Butler returning to her role because she was absolutely perfect in the first one. I suspect she didn't read the script though (or agreed before it was even written), because all this one did was completely ruin the character originally created. The format is completely changed, which is not necessarily a bad thing, a third one done exactly the same might have been pushing it, but if this was the best alternative they could come up with then things should have just been left as they were after two. The dialogue is terrible, especially from the police officers. At one point a female officer walks into a rape support group and starts deliberately teasing a man about the pronouncement of his name. This was absolutely shudder-worthy and unfortunately only one of many instances like it in the film. Every character is unbelievably annoying (yes even 'Jennifer Hills') and consequently where the first two films did such a good job of creating sympathy for the lead character and utter despise of the villains, that's non-existent this time around. An absolute misfire that should never have been made.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NzkzMjE3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU5NTAwNzE@._V1_UY209_CR8,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He did a decent job behind the camera and in directing his cast, but his writing certainly needed some tweaking. Some scenes were too long and others needed more information (e.g the dinner plate and it's people), so there were obvious plot and technical issues with his screenplay.""Running with the Devil"" is fascinating when dealing only with procedure, with Cabell capturing the machine of trafficking and its problematic participants, with a few unable to refuse an opportunity to sample the goods, either to satisfy themselves or impress others. Cabell doesn't craft a nail-biter, but there's underworld awareness here that gives the feature something different to do.Double-crosses and hasty decisions return in the final act of ""Running with the Devil,"" which becomes more formulaic as Cabell tries to figure out a way to tie up multiple subplots, with special concentration on The Man, who can't dig his way out of trouble, and The Agent in Charge, who understands the futility of enforcement, but can't quite give up the hunt. Cabell delivers some tepid turns of plot, though he does have a cast capable of making thin screenwriting come alive (Fishburne is having his fun here, and Bibb does well in dogged pursuit mode, and Cage is very fitting and convincing in his character), helping the viewing experience to a certain degree. No one will mistake ""Running with the Devil"" for a documentary of the ""do's and don'ts"" of running your own cocaine business, or on the global crisis, but Cabell doesn't completely commit to dramatic exaggeration, keeping observation alive for good stretch of the movie.The pacing was quite good with a constant story non-stop, that the 100 min run-time breezed by quickly. The cinematography was on point, and the score decent.It's a well deserved 8/10 from me.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2JjZWU0MTUtZDNkMC00MmViLTg1MDAtNzI1OTNlODJhN2E3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA1MDIxODk4._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

With the possible exceptions of Hitchcock and Fassbinder, I can think of no other director who so completely understood the potential of the medium to transcend the traditional conventions of narrative, or exploited this potential with such ÃÂ©lan. And he doesn't rely on special effects: we enter the surreal realm so seamlessly that it at times seems banal. This is especially the case in 'Le charme': banal people have banal sub-consciousnesses.In order to begin to appreciate Bunuel I had to immerse myself in his milieu, so foreign was his sensibility to the usual expectations I had brought with me into a movie theater.It took me several viewings to get the 'jokes' if 'Le charme'. The Ambassador from some obscure Latin American country ('Miranda', or 'wonder', a nod to Shakespeare), supports this little microcosm of comfortable Parisian bourgeois respectability with cocaine smuggled in diplomatic pouches. Guests arrive for a dinner party on the wrong evening, and interrupt the hosts having sex. A wake is being held in the back room of the restaurant they are planning to dine at. Ice cubes for martinis must be 'exactly zero degrees'. Elegant ladies sit down for a fashionable afternoon tea, only to be told by their waiter that the restaurant has run out of water (?!!). A soldier then comes to their table and relates his parricidal dream, while the polite ladies listen to him unfazed. One of the ladies discreetly slips away for an assignation with another one's husband. Only Bunuel! Doubtless the inspiration for this film comes from the Latin Bunuel's lifetime of experience observing the French in situ. Much of its fun comes from simply watching the French be so . . . French. And there is no bourgeois like a French bourgeois! Much of 'Le Charme' takes place in the nightmares of its characters: you are sitting down for a dinner being hosted by a general, only to realize that you are on stage (with a prompter giving a cue from Don Juan: 'Invite the commander's ghost for dinner!'); your elegant dinner party is broken up by a gang of thugs looking to kill you. However, you are so wedded to the ceremony of the dinner party that you get caught stealing a piece of meat from the table under which you are hiding (and end up dying like a dog!) I could see this movie a hundred times and always find something new. I would never be bored by it.Bunuel is very funny, but he is also dense and difficult. One doesn't realize the true complexity of his films because they all seem so effortless. Nothing great comes easily. He's like great Bordeaux: you can't quaff it -- it demands to be sipped.Bunuel is famous for having the lowest shoot to take ratio of any filmmaker, less than 2:1. Second takes were rare (compare with the reams that end up on the cutting room floor for the typical Spielberg film.) He knew exactly what he wanted to see before he shot. Hitchcock, a director who resembles Bunuel in many ways, famously referred to actors as 'cattle'. For Bunuel, they were probably more like toy soldiers. This isn't to say that he didn't get brilliant performances out of them, especially from his screen alter-ego, the wonderful Fernando Rey.Henry Miller dubbed his good friend Luis Bunuel ""The Last Heretic"". I can't think of a higher compliment. Bunuel's memoirs, 'My Last Sigh', are a must read for anyone who wants to have an appreciation of Paris in the 20s, the of art in the last century, and martinis, made as they should be, with gin.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzNhMmY1OTItNDg4YS00YTI2LWI1NTEtYzcwM2Q3Njk5NDM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDE0OTU3NDY@._V1_UY209_CR8,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Enter smart aleck down on his luck playboy, Lou Castel, who has some golddigging motives behind his slick hipster seduction techniques and has no qualms about how he gets what he wants. He encourages Baker's character's incipient alcoholism and dubious self-esteem, brings in his supposed 'sister' to help drag Baker even further into a maze of sick mind games, drug addiction and group sex, all culminating in a descent into near-madness and self-destructive depravity.I won't give away anymore, suffice to say that the film delivers on its swinging sixties, Euro sleaze ambience and psychological suspense thriller credentials in spades. Director Umberto Lenzi's work has been, at best, uneven and he's churned out his share of crap. However, he made some quite good giallos and crime pictures in the sixties and seventies and this is one of them (other good films by Lenzi -- SPASMO, SEVEN BLOODSTAINED ORCHIDS, ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON, to name only a few).Unfortunately this film is ofen confused with another okay but not-quite-as-good Lenzi film that was also released briefly here in America under the same PARANOIA title (but is more commonly known, especially on video, as A QUIET PLACE TO KILL).","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUyNDM3NjItYjRkNS00ODM2LTgxYzktNDQ1OTQ3OTUyZmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_UY209_CR5,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's films like this that make me want to watch films - films that are fresh, unpredictable and so rich in symbolism that it has leaves lots of room for discussion. Del Toro was little more than an amateur director at the time this made, but in spite of that he's more than given the professionals a run for their money. Every scene is adeptly filmed, and the way that Del Toro makes contrasts between locations and the two central families is a pleasure to observe. The way that the film switches language from English to Spanish and back again is indicative of the fact that this is a rich tapestry of contradictions and one that makes intelligent comments on many subjects, from obvious ones such as addiction, to more concealed ones, such as a commentary on family; stemming from the way that the roles of child and parent become reversed when our hero becomes afflicted with the vampire-like curse.For the story, Del Toro has taken the classic vampire theme and mixed it with essences of mechanics and the human lust of being able to live forever. The story follows JesÃÂºs Gris, an antique dealer that lives with his granddaughter Aurora and wife Mercedes. One day, our hero happens upon a mechanical scarab that latches itself onto his palm, causing him to bleed. JesÃÂºs slowly gets addicted to the mystical scarab, but there's someone else that wants it and will stop at nothing to get it. The mythology of the scarab is told in a great opening sequence that sets the viewer up for an intriguing and original horror story. The film retains the intrigue that it sets up in it's intro for the duration, and Del Toro ensures that his audience is always left guessing and wanting to see what comes next. The film works due to interesting characters that the audience is able to feel for, and is constantly interesting by the way that Del Toro handles the contrasts that the story presents.On the whole, this is a fabulous horror story that takes an existing legend and makes it it's own. This is exactly the sort of film that cinema needs more of; and it's not one that film fans will want to miss. Highly recommended viewing.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzBjOWUxMTItYWY1OC00Zjg5LTlhYWMtMjI3YjUyMjVkMWFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Crossing Over has a powerhouse cast portraying a far more realistic depiction of attitudes and perspectives in contemporary America. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because towards the end one plot stream takes a Hollywood twist, which while not especially relevant, detracts from the gritty realism of the movie.A lot of people have trouble with portrayals of perspectives which challenge the psychological defense mechanisms we put in place to allow us to filter reality into something easier for us to live with. If we really look at things for what they are, the world is a very scary place. This is why you will notice that people get disproportionately agitated when you challenge these mental constructs, leading to loud and/or ignorant opinions. <--also well portrayed at times in the film. I thought about using smaller words for those weak minded loud mouths, but they probably didn't read this far and I've learned, to my dismay, that all I can do is dismiss their stupidity/cowardice anyways.If you can see past what mass media shoves down your throat, you will thoroughly appreciate this movie, I guarantee it :)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDQ3ODU4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU2MTAzMg@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I could say, once in a great while a film comes along, blah, blah. Or, Only a select few films ever have reached this, blah, blah. Or I could say, if you see one movie this year, blah, blah. You know the drill. These are the opening sentences the big-boy critics use when they really want you to see a flick and when they want a particular review to really stand out. Well, films that deserve this kind of ""special"" praise really do only come around once in a great while. Unbelievably, I have seen two in only six months time. The first was what I like to call the first real 21st Century film, and that was Oldboy. And the second film of this status also comes from Korea, believe it or not, and it is Bittersweet Life.Bittersweet Life is probably one of the most simple, most streamlined modern films I have ever seen. It is lean, mean, and like its lead male, a damn ruthless fighting machine. The film beats along with its Raymond Chandler-like screenplay with all the jazz and style of early 90's John Woo and with the energy and themes of Quentin Tarantino's grind house 70's. Life plays with your emotions, making you care for the bad-guy hero even though he is a vicious killer, and causes one to release tension through laughter when the blood starts gushing like a dozen ruptured fire hoses. Wholesale death, blood by the gallons, broken bones and multiple beatings with humongous pipe-wrenches, two-by-fours, and lead pipes are on order, right after a heaping dish of innocent love and a guy trying for once to do the right thing.The plot, well you see, it's like this: you can see everything coming a mile away, the movie plays it straight, and follows the exact path you know it will and the exact path you hope it will. There are no twist endings, no complicated triple crosses, no hidden motives for the characters. Everything on screen happens the way you see it, and everything thing ends exactly the way you picture it. And this is a good thing. The film is so on track that it doesn't need a twist or a swerve to make you pay attention. It starts at A, ends at E, and hits B, C and D on the way there. Life is so steeped in its genre tropes of noir character and themes that the ending is know to all of us before it even starts. However, it's the journey that matters, and I'll be damned if you can find a better-looking, more brutally violent journey anywhere.As much as I try to analyze the film, nothing comes to mind. And this is the purest of all compliments. The film is as shallow as the pools of blood splattered in the hallways, alleyways and run down exteriors of the sets. Often times a director feels the need to bog a simple story down with twists, and a deeper meaning to hide the fact that they are afraid to just let things happen because they need to happen. Bittersweet Life is not one of these films. It exists with its soul laid bare for all to see, and when the carnage is complete, you thank the film for being honest with itself. As the final credits roll you might find yourself asking, ""Is that it?"" Yes, that is itÃÂcinematic perfection. It is all it needs to be: pure and simple, boisterous and calm, bloody and drenched in gore and an honest movie with nothing to hide. --genrebusters","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjA0NmE3OGUtYTY2OS00OTM2LTg2ZDYtZDBkM2QyNTg3NzIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ3ODkxMjE@._V1_UY209_CR7,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The concept was great and this was even before I found out it was based on a true story. But once I heard that it makes me want to look into it a lot more and see what differed from actual life and such. Supposedly the movie was pretty accurate though. It's amazing that good foreign films blow the socks off of most Hollywood garbage any day of the week. They're more realistic and the characters act more like real people would in day to day situations. The love story in this might've been the only thing that I think could've been done better since it became a little weird here and there. Other than that the suspense kept me going and the thought that this could happen to anyone is really scary to ponder. I'm pretty sure I'd like to see this made into an American version only because I'm quite positive they'd butcher it and wouldn't contain anything near the desired effect as has usually been the case in the past.

That's the first problem here. Howard didn't want The Missing to be identified with a specific genre. This is part Western, part period drama, part mystical thriller, part action movie. Using several genres to make this unique could have worked, if Howard had combined them all in one. But the problem is that he seemed to keep changing his mind every 25 minutes of screentime. At first it's a period drama about a family, then it's a western, then it's an action movie, then it's a mystical thriller. There was no consistency with what the story was supposed to be. To add to this, The Missing was too long. I have no problem with long movies. I don't mind movies that are 3:30 hours long, if every scene feels like it belongs and is relevant. But here, there are several scenes that could have been cut. And going back to my complaint about there not being a specific genre, I think it could have worked if it was only a period drama/action/western. But when it got into the mystical Indian witchcraft, I checked out. We had more than an hour and a half building this up as a legitimate and realistic dramatic film taking place in the western time period, and all of a sudden, it's a fantasy movie. If it had been about mystical Indian witchcraft from the start, those scenes would not have been out of place. But to spring it on the audience the way it was done, it was totally out of place.I feel a little weird making my complaints about The Missing, because I actually did enjoy watching it, for the most part. I thought it built an interesting story and I was satisfied with how it concluded. Tommy Lee Jones is at his best since Rules Of Engagement. Cate Blanchett was without a doubt at her best since Elizabeth. And the dialogue is fantastic, as is the Cinematography. James Horner surprise me with his score. It was different from what I'm used to him doing. I loved the story and thought it was entertaining to watch. So why doesn't The Missing work as well as it could have? Simply because Ron Howard had a very ambitious idea about how to make a Western movie different and unique, but didn't spend quite enough time developing it. If Howard had taken an extra 6 months of pre-production, I'm convinced this could have been the brilliant movie that Howard probably had a vision for.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWM1ZmU5NWItZDM0ZC00MTk5LThiMTktZGUxOThjNzI5NTcyL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

No, i don't believe that at all. We hairless primates should learn not to ascribe any moderately complex emotion solely under the category ""human"".To me, the real strength of this film was its allegory to the destruction of nature. I don't think it entirely inplausible that the writer wanted to symbolize the strife between man's greed, and the annhilation of this planet's animals and ecosystems. The point could  have been, that our own planet at some critical point might strike out at us.And come on you guys, after watching ""JAWS"" you want killer animal flicks that conform to modern day science?

A subtle classic","How can you NOT love a movie that actually has a clip from a 3 Stooges short?But seriously, this movie has a way of getting under the skin of many who view it. Like ""Bagdad Cafe"", and ""Summer of '42"" this movie has a certain 'magic' to it that stays with you for a very long time afterward. It's not due to any one element, but rather, the synergy created between the beautiful cinematography of the lush Greek scenery, the chemistry between the drop-dead gorgeous cast (all at their absolute peak of sexual/physical ripeness), a dynamic, inspiring soundtrack, and a subtle, well-crafted plot (if you can actually call it that...it is more of a skeletal framework...a backdrop against which to explore the issues at hand) It is a more mature examination, a graduate course, if you will, of the sexual revolution. It is a victory celebration of polyamorous relationships. It's the other side of the coin of 'Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice'. It is ""The Harrod Experiment"" coming-of-age. (To those of you who were 15 when you saw ""Summer Lovers"", I doubt you've heard of The Harrod Experiment. The casualness with which nudity is handled in this flick only contributes to the overall beauty of it. (I doubt the movie would have had nearly the same effect if the principals were Roseanne & Oprah, with Pauley Shore playing the male lead...) Funny thing, when it came out, prurient minds dismissed it as the quintessential sleazy male fantasy. There was just one problem with this knee-jerk review...Females liked it as much (if not more) than male viewers!!! This movie has confounded the critics since its debut...and still does so as it continues to win fans 22 years after its release. It is one of the few truly realistic depictions of an 'alternate lifestyle', handled with exquisitely good taste with just the right amount of restraint. Even the editing is exemplary. Truly a classic bit of film-making.Warning: View it at your own risk. As I stated, the 'message' of this movie is insidious, and can cause one to re-examine some long-held social conventions. Subsequent viewings only enhance this effect. 5 years before ""Dirty Dancing"", there was Summer Lovers.The sole tragic note to this movie is that Valerie Quennessen died only 7 years after its release.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNjk0Mjg1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAyMTM3NA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In fact, the apparent cliches presented in the trailers kept me away. Thank goodness for DVD!Finally--- the DVD is also great. The ""making of"" segment is amazing, and worthy of it's own venue.

Basically there are two stories, a teenage girl's coming of age, and a dentist's philandering. But neither story is developed enough so the viewer would care. No involvement is created with the characters, because the characters undergo no significant changes or growth. The cinematography is attractive, but the acting is variable. Marceau does not get to do anything beyond staring from underneath her bangs. Fossey is gorgeous and highly likable, but she does not get to do anything significant either. Brasseur is a most unfortunate choice for the dentist...he seems to have wandered in from the set next door where he was playing a Marseilles gangster. It is just too difficult to visualize him as somebody who nominally graduated dental school and not as a waterfront thug. Denise Grey is charming as the grandmother, but her part, again, is predictable and introduces nothing new.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmU4NDQ0NDItOWZlNi00ZjAzLWFlMWItN2M4ZjFjYmUwMjA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The weakest element is probably the story which is on the improbable end of the spectrum but, as long as you forgive the absurdity of the plot and just go with the flow, it's a thoroughly enjoyable 90 minutes. They could also possibly have done with a little more explanation of the back-story rather than jumping straight in - some might find it all a little complicated especially in the first half hour. The comedy is uniquely Glasgow and the language typically (and authentically!) blue. Visually it's all nicely shot with some of the more off-beat Glasgow landmarks featuring prominently. The acting is great with, as others have noted, standout performances by both Emma Thomson & Ray Winstone. I can't help thinking that Robert Carlyle as Director got better performances out of his other leads than he did out of Robert Carlyle (Actor) - perhaps the double responsibility of first time director and lead actor was a little too much to pull off. Not that his performance was bad, just a little lacking in finesse in places.Minor criticisms apart, this is a very enjoyable movie and well worth watching.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyOTMxMzMyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA0NTQwODE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It was a pivotal movie that showed me the self hate that we all had during that time, and how that hate manifested in our relationships with self and others. This revision of that film with a 2020 cast was every bit as powerful and poignant, with an excellent direction by Joe Mantelo. Thank God they did not try to modernize the film and kept the original 1968 time. Jim Parsons is just an amazing actor as is Zachary Quinto who captured Michal and Harold with intensity and focus. The whole cast was amazing.In some ways the play has a certain dated feel but that does not distract it enhances. The Gay men's community has been a work in progress and Mark Crowley wrote this decades before liberation, AIDS, gay marriage, wrote this when being gay was a crime.

Others might not.","I am an avid fan of the original movie. While the concept of vigilantism has been around for decades in film, it was never communicated in such a way. The original movie was both entertaining, and made certain statements about society. After all, isn't the first purpose of film to entertain, and the second to create a message? If the first movie focused on the message, the second seemed to focus more on the entertainment. I'm OK with that. I already know what the McManus boys are all about. Still, it was refreshing to see Il Duce's beginning as a killer, even catching a glimpse of the first version of the gun vest.I was very skeptical of Clifton Collins Jr., thinking that he would simply be a stand-in for Rocco. He wasn't. He had his own personality, although I would have liked to have seen him involved in what the boys were doing on a more personal level. It was like he was waiting for them to come along just so he would have an excuse to kill mobsters.The humor, slow-motion gunfights, and light-hearted moments were back. During the first half, I sometimes felt the humor needed to be left behind and the serious tone needed to come into play, but the second half delivered that aspect very well, so it balances out in the end.Julie Benz. Hmmmm. Attractive, intelligent, fun. But the southern accent is so thick I had a hard time focusing on anything else.I would like to make a special note of how ridiculous it is for someone to dual-wield Desert Eagles, even if they have compensators attached.Still, none of my complaints stopped me from enjoying the movie. I watched it for what it is. An over the top-low(er) budget film that was written to please fans of the original. I took it for what it is, and I think I'm better off for it.Many people criticize Troy and the films themselves, some going so far as to say fans should go kill themselves. The internet, where everyone thinks their opinion is fact, and everyone is a hardass. If you don't like the movies, fine, but please, don't insult the intelligence of the fans. Liking something that you don't doesn't make us any less intelligent than you. If you want to pick on someone, pick on the Twilight fans that think those movies are a real representation of love and vampire mythology.I hear Troy can be a bit of a douche. Maybe that's true, maybe it isn't. What isn't true, is that the movies do not rip off of Tarantino. I like Tarantino's work, but he was not the first person to do the flashback narrative, dual wielding of pistols, slow motion gunfights, etc. etc. That's like saying Halo was the first good shooter. All movies borrow elements from one another. They're called themes and archetypes.All in all, an enjoyable film that gives the fans a taste of what they've been missing for ten years. The editing is a little spotty at times, and not everything hits the right beat, but simply to see the boys in action again was enough to make me smile and laugh out loud, and once again, isn't that what movies are supposed to do? Its supposed to entertain us.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4MDMxNzM2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk5MzU5Mg@@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Meanwhile, his wife is forced to enter a brothel and work as a prostitute.","11","A well produced work of surreal erotica","I rented this sex comedy a couple of years ago and I was definitely not ready for the fantastic nature of its sex scenes.  If you can imagine if the same techniques used for martial arts films applied to an erotic film, you might get a feeling of what this film is like.  Sex and Zen is loosely based upon the 400-year old ""The Carnal Prayer Mat"" and is one of the best known of the Hong Kong Category III erotic films.  The plot involves a scholar, played by Lawrence Ng, who believes that enlightenment can be achieved through a hedonistic lifestyle.  For some reason, a wealthy man thinks that it is a good idea to arrange a marriage between the scholar and his sheltered, prudish daughter, played by Amy Yip.  Yip was famous both for the size of her breasts and her refusal to perform fully nude; a body double is used in particular shots.  After the scholar has introduced his new wife to the pleasures of sex, he is soon tempted by other men's wives. Unfortunately, his efforts to woo these women are hampered by both his poor staying power and his undersized genitals.  In order to be a more effective seducer, the scholar agrees to undergo a rather extreme surgical procedure to enhance his abilities.  Following the operation, the scholar undergoes a sexual odyssey while leaving his wife neglected at home.This is a sex comedy and the humor can best be described as adolescent, although I must admit that I chuckled a few times.  However, the film's raison d'etre is its lovemaking scenes.  The sexual encounters in this film start out as ""merely"" vigorous and then escalate to the physically impossible and then to the gleefully excessive.  What ""The Blues Brothers"" did for car crashes, this film does for sex scenes.  There are several distinctions between this kind of filmmaking and Western erotic films. First of all, the women in Sex and Zen are stunningly, naturally attractive and don't have any silicone implants to detract from their beauty. Moreover, the film has significant production value.  Whereas murky photography is used in sex scenes in most American films, here vivid colors are used in the art direction, costuming, and cinematography.  As a result, the film has a surreal, fantastic sort of atmosphere.  Sex and Zen also deviates from vanilla sexuality and includes elements of sadomasochism, lesbianism, and bondage, although all of this is carried out in a playful, nonrealistic manner.  Also, like most erotic films, this is geared mostly towards heterosexual males but there is a bit of male nudity and simulated male genitalia for any women or gay males who might be interested.Finally, a couple of caveats.  An ""R"" rated version of this film can be found at many Blockbuster stores.  Although this was enough to impress me on the first viewing, the editing was clumsy and the unrated film has much juicier comedic and erotic bits (such as misplaced genitals, an unorthodox way for two women to use a flute, an interesting bit of toe-sucking, etc.) The unrated VHS and DVD versions give you the full effect of the film. Also, there is a scene in which a man rapes his wife that is performed in the same surreal erotic manner as the rest of the film.  Although this initially seems unenlightened, given the overall comic fantasy tone of the film, it's hard to be too offended.  Overall, this is a well made piece of erotica recommended for those looking for something different.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFmODRmMTUtNmU3Zi00MGM4LTgxYmQtOTA5NzEyZDg0ZmE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_UY209_CR6,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The drawn out book itself isn't among King's best work. Still, the fascination of the story lies in the detail and that had to be trimmed down for a 2 hours-movie version (there is another cut of the movie that's one hour longer, by the way). A lot of things had to be kicked out, but there was way too much changing around of events, items and characters. Ace Merril, a very important character for the novel's big finale, was ignored completely, for instance. I could understand things like that if they improved the movie. Kubrick made a lot of changes with his version of ""Shining"" and at least one could see why. With ""Needful Things"" the changes seem totally random and that's rather annoying for someone who has read the book.If you don't know the story beforehand the movie will probably still seem rushed. You can't really make a connection with the many characters and Sheriff Alan Pangborn finding out what's going on in the town seems unbelievable. It didn't really work in the book, but in the movie it's just stupid that he would draw such far fetched conclusions so quickly.The acting, on the other hand, is solid. Max von Sydow is a good choice for the part of Leland Gaunt, and Ed Harris is great as ever, although he has to work with a rather mediocre script. The sidecharacters are okay for the most part, even though Polly Chalmers and Wilma Jerzyck are maybe exaggerated.Unlike a lot of latter King adaptations this one seems to have been made with a decent budget. The locations look good and there are a few nice special effects. At times the explosions and the score can be too much, though. It's as if director Fraser Clarke Heston realized his movie wasn't turning out as exciting as he hoped, so he decided to blow it up with some dramatic music and fire.Well, as I've said in the headline. This movie could have been a lot better, but it could also have been a complete failure. As it is, it's good for one viewing but if you've read the novel you're going to be disappointed.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODFjMzIyM2UtZGE5Mi00ODM3LTlhODQtODI3NmU0ZDRiM2RiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Certainly it's an odd book from Leonard, as he admitted in his introduction, but it worked for me, and given Paul Schraeder's history with religious themed films(TAXI DRIVER, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST), it seemed natural he would direct.  This is not a great movie, because Schraeder doesn't go as deep as Leonard did into his characters, and some of the humor doesn't translate.  But most of it does, and this avoids the heavy-handedness of most movies about angels/healers/devils.  Part of that is due to Skeet Ulrich, who should avoid hearing Johnny Depp comparisons after this movie, because he shows a personality all of his own.  And Bridget Fonda pairs up nicely with him.

Its one gem lies on how it handled the bitter truths about sexual abuse, acceptance, and homosexual struggle, as well as a working poor on wits end, coercion, or simply being tangled everyday between a rock and a hard place, which makes it so painful because it's true.There was no glamour or stirring scene, but rather dour, unpleasant upbringing attitudes except for the sister, Betina. There were no payoffs especially to the affair he had with Julio (Juan Salmieri). And suffocating chemistry he has with Ramirez, uninteresting main character with generic acting from Ariel (Wall Javier) and most of its minor characters dragging the already drab storyline.The movie came out 2019 but it looks so rustic and frumpish, it felt being in the 90's soap operas of uninteresting slow burn genre with no direction. The plot goes haywire by the second and trivially introduces character that doesn't by any chance glue the film cohesively or make any difference.Personally, the story felt like an old, erotic novel, or an afternoon drama flick series for adults in their 60's that have 600+ episodes that pays more attention to the sex details rather than the life after the sex, of which unfortunately made into a one film. ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhStory wise?

The gypsies carve a permanent smile in the young boy's face and then leave him for dead as they leave for their homeland.  The young boy wanders aimlessly for shelter amidst the cold coastline filled with snow, ruins, and swinging bodies from the hangman's noose in the background.  Here he finds an infant..alive..clutched in the frozen hands of a woman whose husband was hanged.  This was the beginning of The Man Who Laughs...and it was so powerfully filmed that a race of emotions filled me as I watched awe-struck, yet horrified.  Paul Leni directed this great film based on the novel by Victor Hugo.  Conrad Veidt plays the grown Gwynplaine who travels around the English countryside with his adopted parent Ursus the Philosopher and the young Dea, the girl whose life he saved as a baby.  Dea has turned into a blooming young woman, yet blind from her birth. Dea is played very nicely by Mary Philbin, who played in The Phantom of the Opera(1925) in the female lead. The way Leni has the characters interact is very effective.  We can feel the tension in Veidt's character as he submits to the growing pains of love.  We feel his sorrow as he cries through smiles.  The rest of the film involves a royal plot by the queen and her henchman/jester(by the way, Brandon Hurst does a phenomenal job as this cruel heartless jester) to reinstate some royal property to Gwynplaine so he can be married to a duchess that the queen does not like.  The story is pretty good and one can see where it is going early on, but the way Leni creates suspense and pathos overpowers any negative defects.  The acting all around is very strong. This is a powerful film on many levels.  It is an emotional rollercoaster ride through love, hate, despair, joy, and much more.  I laughed; I cried. The best part though was that the film has a marvelous message about perceptions.  Here we have this character Gwynplaine that smiles outwardly and makes people laugh, but he is full of despair.  He cries on the inside. People should not always be taken at face value.   By the way, Bob Kane, the creator of Batman, credits this film and the character of Gywnplaine for his creation of the Joker.  I can see how.  Watch this and the silent version of The Bat in the same evening and you will see what stirred a young Bob Kane's imagination.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWFjMTkwOWYtNWVhOS00ZDMyLTg0NTAtOGZjNjNiNjU5OTYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc5NjEzNA@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I'll even go so far as to say a great film. I really think that Chris Carter, David Duchovny, and Gillian Anderson delivered what they had promised to. All along, throughout the post-production and press campaign we've been told that this is a creepy story with Mulder and Scully's relationship at its core. Well, that's what it is ... plain and simple. I really think that all the negativity and people's harsh reviews are from false and hyped up expectations of what this movie is supposed to be. If anything, you should just try to walk into the theatre with an open mind.But I almost think some people who reviewed this film, saw a different film than I did ...1. I read a review in which the person said Gillian Anderson's acting was awful. That is false. It is quite the contrary. Gillian Anderson is probably one of the strongest aspects of this movie. Every time she's in a scene, you're captivated.2. I had read that Mulder and Scully don't show up in the film until 45 minutes into it. False. Scully appears in the 3rd scene - so what? no more than 7 minutes? - and Mulder directly follows.3. Someone complained about an irrelevant and torturously long scene where Mulder fills up his gas tank. This doesn't happen. He goes to a gas station, gets out of his car, and goes into a store.4. Lastly, it was rumored that the actors where flubbing up their lines all the time. Okay, even if they did, that wouldn't end up in the final film. Obviously they do multiple takes for a reason. The lines are solid.This movie is not boring. The surprises are there. It may not be scary in a 'horror film' sort of way where things are jumping out at you every 2 seconds, but it is scary. The acting is amazing. Gillian Anderson on her own is a joy to watch, but when you put her in a scene with David it's either going to break your heart or melt it. The supporting cast won't let you down, and neither will the storyline. It's not paranormal in the sense of freaks and monsters, but religion and God. It's very much in the fashion of ""All Things""; seeing the signs and following them. Finally, it is just excellently put together. Whoever edited this film did a phenomenal job! The inter-cutting and juxtaposition was out of this world.GIVE IT A CHANCE, FOLKS.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk5MThhOTQtZTY5OC00MzgwLWE4MTctNTI4OGEwNjU3YTZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR6,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Gladiator comes to mind. Great cinematography, plot, acting.Then, there are movies, that, although they don't win critical acclaim, seem to find their way onto my TV much more than an oscar-winner. Princess Bride is a good one. Timothy Dalton's bid for a James Bond movie as well. And Jewel of the Nile.Jewel of the Nile is not a stellar specimen of a film in any way. There are movies that are better filmed, better acted, better scripted, ones that don't have as many plot holes, whatever the comparison. It doesn't leave you in a state of deep pondering or leave you not wanting to go to bed for fear of your life. But it is a movie that I, and my family, put in when we want to watch something light, uninvolved, comical, and with actors we like to see. It's something to watch on a Sunday afternoon, over whatever sorry excuse for lunch I decide to have, and to go to sleep on the couch to. It's a good movie to put in and listen to while doing housework, homework, or another activity. It is full of great one-liners that find their way into conversation as well as a severe cheesiness factor in some parts(which isn't a bad thing).Bottom line, I guess, is this: You will find movies that are of superior quality to this one. Ones that you will feel outweigh this one in every single way.

Such is the case with Neil Jordan's `The End of the Affair,' a film that in its bare boned outlining would promise to be nothing more than a conventional, three-handkerchief weepie centered around the hoary issue of romantic infidelity, but which emerges, instead, as a beautiful and moving meditation on the overwhelming force jealousy, love, commitment and passion can exert on our lives.Ralph Fiennes stars as Maurice Bendrix, a British writer living in 1940's London, who has an affair with Sarah Miles (Julianne Moore), the wife of Maurice's friend, Henry (Stephen Rea).  Based on a Graham Greene novel, the film achieves far greater intellectual and emotional depth than this skeletal outline would indicate.  Part of the success rests in the fact that both the original author and the adapter, writer/director Neil Jordan, have devised a multi-level scenario that utilizes a number of narrative techniques as the means of revealing crucial information to the audience regarding both the plot and the characters.  For instance, the film travels fluidly back and forth in time, spanning the decade of the 1940's, from the initial meeting between Bendrix and Sarah in 1939, through the horrendous bombings of London during World War II to the `present' time of the post-war British world.  This allows the authors to reveal the details of the affair slowly, enhanced by the even more striking technique of having the events viewed from the entirely different viewpoints of the two main characters involved.  `Rashomon' ÃÂ like, we first see the affair through the prism of Bendrix's limited perspective, only to discover, after he has confiscated Sarah's diary, that he (and consequently we) have been utterly mistaken as to the personal attributes and moral quality of Sarah all along.  Thus, as an added irony, Bendrix discovers that he has been obsessing over a woman he `loves' but, in reality, knows little about.The authors also enhance the depth of the story through their examination of TWO men struggling with their overwhelming jealousy for the same woman and the complex inter-relationships that are set up as a result.  In fact, the chief distinction of this film is the way it manages to lay bare the souls of all three of these fascinating characters, making them complex, enigmatic and three-dimensional human beings with which, in their universality, we can all identify.  Bendrix struggles with his raging romantic passions, his obsessive jealousy for the woman he can't possess and his lack of belief in God, the last of which faces its ultimate challenge at the end.  Sarah struggles with the lack of passion she finds in the man she has married but cannot love as more than a friend, juxtaposed to the intense love she feels for this man she knows she can never fully have.  In addition, she finds herself strangely faithful, if not to the two men in her life, at least to two crucial commitments (one to her wedding vows and one to God) yet unable to fully understand why.  Henry struggles with his inadequacies as a lover and the strange possessiveness that nevertheless holds sway over him.  Even the minor characters are fascinating.  Particularly intriguing is the private investigator who becomes strangely enmeshed in the entire business as both Bendrix and Henry set him out to record Sarah's activities and whereabouts, a man full of compassion for the people whom he is, by the nature of his profession, supposed to view from a position of coldhearted objectivity.  (One plot flaw does, however, show up here:  why would this man, whose job it is to spy on unsuspecting people for his clients, employ a boy to help him who sports a very distinctive birthmark on one side of his face?).`The End of the Affair' would not be the noteworthy triumph it is without the stellar, subtly nuanced   performances of its three main stars.  In addition, as director, Jordan, especially in the second half, achieves a lyricism rare in modern filmmaking.  Through a fluidly gliding camera and a mesmerizing musical score, Jordan lifts the film almost to the level of cinematic poetry as we sit transfixed by the emotional richness and romantic purity of the experience.  `The End of the Affair' takes its place alongside `Brief Encounter' and `Two For the Road' as one of the very best studies of a romantic relationship ever put on film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzhkNDRkMDctYTcxMy00MTI3LWI5ODQtZWNkYWQ2ZjA2ZDk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Robinson's career that has inexplicably and unfortunately been forgotten.  A tale which anticipates ""Citizen Kane"" in an astonishing number of ways, it tells the moving story of a multi-dimensional character transformed from an idealistic and impetuous young man into a ruthless, demanding, ultimately abandoned force in business and politics.  Robinson's character, John Hayden, knows how to get what he wants, but is never sure what that really is.  Solid performances by a first-rate cast complement a scenario able to cover decades with crisp efficiency.There are some unfortunate sequences in which the dialog becomes florid, stilted, and too much in the manner of a lesser Victorian romance.  And the use of ""Home On The Range"" as a Rosebud motif comes across as ludicrous, to put it charitably.  Such flaws, however, do not seriously lessen the impact and entertainment value of this undeservedly obscure picture.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzE1Y2RhNzktMjQ0ZC00ODFhLThjMzItYTUyYjg3MmIxYWVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It is presented in the context of a mystery, but this is no mystery thriller. Thrill seekers, go elsewhere.If you crave action, dialog, explanations and clear resolutions to a plot, I suggest you avoid this film. If you are fascinated by human complexity, admire beautifully crafted film-making, and can think and observe for yourself, this may be a rewarding experience for you. If you love and understand great acting you must see this film.It is exquisitely filmed, in an understated and confident manner, using hue and tint as artfully as any great painter. Joe lives in a drab and uninspiring world, mostly of interiors; tight, constricted places, where the inhabitants are caged too closely, too much ever present in each other's spaces. When we are occasionally brought out into the world at large, this tight confining world is often seen to be surrounded by a distant, unreachable beauty. There are subtly beautiful panoramas of the lush greenness of Scotland off in the distance, out of reach of Joe, of all the people of his world.The structure, the editing, the weaving of time present and time past is without conceit. There is no ""look at how cleverly I did that transition"" cutting. It is a perfect representation of editing unseen, unnoticed, the mark of brilliant editing. Everything comes together, simply and without explanation. Characters are presented simply, without prelude. Events occur, without justification. You must think and observe for yourself. If there are conclusions to be made, they must be yours.If for no other reason, see this film to experience Ewan McGregor: He has been a reasonably attractive and adequate performer, in mostly rather forgettable productions, until now. Here he suddenly emerges as an actor of astounding depth and complexity, inhabiting, living, revealing another soul. Without any reservation this is a great performance. His subtlety, his inner directed creation of a complete individual, is simply remarkable. It is a complete, compelling, always true performance. You cannot look away from Joe. You must follow him, know him. Do you know him? Can you ever really know him?The plot, what little of it there is, unfolds through character and behavior, with a minimum of dialog. There is much complete silence in this film. The score is understated, never telegraphing what you are supposed to feel or think. Indeed, I doubt that there is an answer to any question here. Who is Joe? What is Joe? That is not the point.Here is Joe. This is what he is, this is what he has done. What will he do now? There is a quiet suspense, never quite gratified, which begins with the very first frame,a corpse, gently floating, photographed darkly, from below, so dark there is no face. A deceased, faceless female human being.Joe's is the first face we see. That first glimpse of his eyes, told me that nothing would be what it seemed in this film. Joe sees something we do not see. So begins the mystery.Nothing is jarring, nothing is false. Life is simply never quite what we think it is. Make no mistake. There is a real mystery here to be revealed. Not a contrived, plot dependent series of revelations. It is the unpeeling of the layers of a human being.Much has been mentioned in this forum about the frequent sex scenes. They are achingly non-erotic, distanced and cold, and ultimately only functional. It is a passionless, desperate, mutually using and abusing kind of sex. Only one scene has heat. And that scene is not really sex. It is frustration, anger, vengeance, humiliation and desperation. This scene is truly horrible, truly frightening and truly revelatory.I haven't told you much about the plot. That is deliberate. The plot works. It reveals the character. The progression of events is true, often surprising, but never false, never contrived. If you need to be told what is happening and why, this is not for you.If you love great acting, by all involved, and appreciate the crafts and arts of film construction, I highly recommend ""Young Adam"".(I have one question for anyone out there who might have a feasible answer: the title confounds me. There is no Adam. Nor is there any reference to an Adam. I could draw no path to or from Genesis. So why is this called ""Young Adam""?)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjUxMzU5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzc2NTUyMQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

They make expectations so low in the trailer that you almost have to enjoy the film. Was it a great comedy? No. However, it was much better than I ever could have hoped as Michael McCullers takes us places you never would expect going in. I thought that it would be a water-downed, overlong SNL skit with one woman asking another to carry her baby, leading to a generic odd couple pairing with hijinks and gags piling on top of each other, collapsing under its own weight. Instead we are treated to a pretty sentimental and touching portrait of two women learning to grow and evolve with help from the other, a person, in both regards, that they never would have thought could teach them anything. Even the pregnancy aspect takes a ton of twists and turns never becoming the straight shot gimmick just bringing everyone together. The surrogate mother here must make some tough decisions as she continues along on her journey, lending a side to the tale that actually brings it to a level of intrigue that no Lorne Michaels film has done in recent memory.I don't want to ruin the plot points of Angie Ostrowiski's pregnancy, but let's just say it isn't cut and dry. Her motives aren't genuine, something that is obvious from the start, just not quite in the way you anticipate. There are surprises for her and secrets hidden from the other characters as she wrestles within herself. A ""white-trash"" loser, attached to a man that believes waiting on the phone to be the 132.7 caller is a job, Angie learns a lot while with mom-to-be Kate Holbrook. Kate, being the professional VP of an organic food market, is a very detail orientated woman who is by the books and unafraid to tell others what they should do. It is an oil and water connection, butÃÂlike all good relationships of this kindÃÂbreeds some real funny and touching moments. Who thought watching Karaoke on the Playstation could be so much fun? Sure many instances feel like skits written separately and plugged in later, (the clubbing while pregnant, the press conference ambush, and the surrogate therapy sessionÃÂprobably the funniest scene without question), but they are surprisingly strung together to make a pretty coherent whole.The other thing that the trailer hides is the inclusion of two great male roles. Did anyone know that Greg Kinnear and Steve Martin were in this thing? I for one was completely surprised by both, almost chuckling that they would have a small cameo until I realized that both were key roles to the whole. In the best turn of the film, Steve Martin is crazy, hippie genius. His earthy style of living, complete with long ponytail and soft speech, even when angered, is classic, as is everything uttered from his mouth. He is so good that I would be thrilled to have him offer me 5 uninterrupted minutes of staring into his eyes as a reward for a job well done. For Kinnear's part, he plays the usual love interest that is commonplace in films of this ilk. It's not flashy and it's not very original, but Greg is a stalwart and pulls off the good guy persona, even including a little bit of physical humor at the end.Overall, though, this film is pretty standard fare. It goes into very broad comedy at times and very sappy/overly-sentimental drivel at others. There are some good jokes sprinkled throughout and for the most part keep it fun for the duration. Definitely feeling longer than it is, I never quite felt bored and I did begin to get invested in the story to see how it all would turn out. A lot of that can be credited to the chemistry between Tina Fey and Amy Pohler as Kate and Angie respectively. Both these women do a great job with their roles, fleshing out the psychotic relationship to perfection. One of the successful dynamics is how Fey becomes a mother figure to her surrogate. Even going so far as having temper tantrums and rubber-faced reactions, Pohler is a child.It's also nice to see some fun moments from the supporting cast, but again nothing really sticks out to vault anything into must see territory. Sigourney Weaver is actually kinda scary in a very weird role; Romany Malco has plenty of great one-liners and facial expressions; and John Hodgeman is a bit odd in a small bit, with laughs coming more from the recognition of his Mac commercials than anything he does in the film. In the end, while nothing over-achieves, it all adds up to a pretty solid comedy worth a view. Is it necessary to see on the big screen? Probably not, but if you were worried that it might be a train-wreck, just know that it never takes any chances to risk derailing, and that's not a bad thing.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwNTc1Nzk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjE4OTI2MQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I am eager to hear more, to listen to his words, and be intrigued by how his thoughts are still relevant in today's society. This was a beautiful film made in 1974. The decision by director Bob Fosse to film it completely in black and white was brilliant. Hoffman and Perrine's chemistry is brilliant as well as their performances. The power of this man is vividly demonstrated through this film, leaving you with questions answered as well as a desire to hear more. This was such a captivating feature. From the opening sequence of words spewing from a mouth to the final shot of Lenny Bruce, I was glued to my seat.To begin, the cinematography was better than most feature films. Fosse knew what he was doing and did it with the greatest of ease. His choice to film completely in black and white really helped me hear the words that Bruce spoke instead of just being involved in the colors that surrounded him. The black and white feature gave Hoffman the ability to create a human from his character and take us away from Hoffman and into the mind of comic Lenny Bruce. The shots that Fosse used also assisted with building this compelling story. Every shot is important in this film, and Fosse does a great job of demonstrating and explaining the ""why"" and ""where"" of a scene. This was his first and only non musical, and he was triumphant. The way that the story works in a pseudo-documentary style was impeccable. While you are never quite told who the person is behind the camera, you do get that raw emotion from the actors as if you were watching a real documentary. There was just so much emotion that Fosse pulled from his troupe in this film that you could only watch in amazement. It also left the door open to the question of who is behind the camera. With the words that Bruce said nightly in his show, I couldn't help but think of the possibility of government conspiracy. Maybe I am way off, but there was that aura of ""cover-up"" throughout this film. Even the final sequence gives off that sense.BAM ÃÂ Powerful cinematography is right in front of you, but whom do we have in the center of the camera? None other than a very young and fresh Dustin Hoffman. This film really showcased his talents. While he had several films before this one that brought him into the spotlight, I thought that he went above and beyond for this film. He really transformed himself into the character. Some of my favorite moments with Hoffman in Lenny was when he thinks about the nurse the first time, when Honey calls asking for money, and when he asks the Judge to sentence him now instead of going through the trial. The vision of defeat was spectacular. You see in this film why Hoffman is considered one of the greats of Hollywood. Valerie Perrine, also a young actress at the time, was immaculate. Her portrayal of Honey needs to go in the history books. Actresses today could take a moment or two to learn from this dramatic actress. These two actors really brought this film together. They took you deep into the life of this radical thinker and kept you nestled deeply inside of him. They shined greatly, and the Academy saw it too! BAM ÃÂ Cinematography, BAM ÃÂ award winning acting, what can be the final BAM? How about Lenny Bruce? Born well after his death, I had never even heard of the man, but the words that I witnessed from this film from his mouth shocked me. Not so much because of the shock value that surrounded them, but just how relevant his work is still today. As homosexuality becomes a staple in our community and society, Lenny's comments on the teachers in this film seemed like topics we are still talking about today. He was way ahead of his time, and I think that is why people feared him. Living with an English teacher, I am constantly involved with the English language, but I am also shown information about those that have no interest because they do not see how it relates to ""real"" life. I am also aware of how little respect English gets as daily we hear of schools cutting back on their Literature studies to help support their sports program, or how the first way to cut back spending is to close libraries. These are sad days that we live in, and if only people could see how powerful words can be in defending yourself and explaining the world, I think we would see a rebirth. If I had the option to fight with a loaded gun or an aggressive dictionary, I think you can see which I would choose. Lenny Bruce did no harm to anyone, he spoke his mind, and for that he was convicted. What a sad day for America.Grade: ***** out of *****","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWFiODE1YjItYWE5OC00OWUxLThiNjEtNDRlNWU2NDdmMzc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

That's the French bad way of making movies (coucou Luc Besson). It's impossible for only one person to have all those talents. I believe Jeremy Zag is a good director, but the script and the songs are very bad.Ah... the songs. What a strange idea to add them. They are all so mellow, cheesy. The lyrics are very bad, the choregraphies are non-sense... the audience in the theater was teared between exasperation and laughters for each of them (including my 3 kids) .

They were sure right about this one. The plot is so ridiculous it doesn't bear mentioning -- the magic is all in the execution, e.g., Anitra Ford stripping and writhing to the strains of Rimsky-Korsakov's ""Scheherezade"", a secret laboratory in which women are transformed into seductive automatons by a procedure involving their being bathed in honey and then exposed to bees -- lot's of that kind of thing here. And what's this? The film has the US government sending out an agent to investigate the death of a guy who suffered a heart attack during strenuous sex. Is that where our intelligence agencies put their energies? No wonder they were so clueless about 9/11 and Iraq. Now for some inane reason, this film got reissued on DVD under the tile ""Graveyard Tramps"". It's true, there is at least one scene in a cemetery, and as to the female characters being tramps . . . no argument. Nevertheless, what kind of moron would throw away a great title like ""Bee Girls"" for something so prosaic? Oh, and the DVD cover for some reason identifies the female lead as the late Claudia Jennings, who is not even in the film (the lead is her fellow Playmate Victoria Vetri). Go figure. Here's another thing I love about this film -- although it is completely about sex, albeit sex in the context of some loony incomprehensible plot involving a world takeover, and although there is plenty of nudity and seduction, this film from the early 70's is rated PG. Teens could see it without a chaperone. Yep, back when I was a boy, we didn't suffer from the same neurotic fears we now have about adolescents being permanently damaged by the sight of a female breast. Seems we were relatively hardy in those days, although on the other hand, we didn't have to deal with news reports of beheadings and the like. But I digress. There will always be a special place in my heart for Invasion of the Bee Girls, the sine qua non of its genre.

I'm talking about director Carl Franklin, who did a similar (but much better) ""race card"" film the following year in ""Devil With A Blue Dress."" I could put up with the bias in that film because it was so beautifully-photographed and had such good 1940s ambiance. However, this movie didn't offer those visuals a cool lead character played by Denzel Washington. In these two films, all the white people are scumbags and the hero (oes) are blacks. That's bias. If the reverse were shown, critics would be screaming! Can you say ""double standard?""Gutless Liberal critics, of course, raved about this mess, er movie, so I got sucked into watching it. It's no ""Devil In A Blue Dress,"" let me tell you. It's generally a convoluted, boring story with characters that are a little unbelievable such as thug with a 150 I.Q. who still does dumb things. Bill Paxton, as the sheriff, is probably the most annoying actor in the film and plays a favorite of (mostly White) liberal writers - the trigger-happy stupid southern sheriff.

It is in the same vein as Ben-Hur and Barabbas, films adapted from a similar source.In this case it is Jesus's robe that he wore to the crucifixion. It is recorded that while He was on the cross waiting to die, Roman soldiers idled their time away by casting dice for the only possession He took to his death, his robe. The lucky winner turned out to be Richard Burton, a tribune recently sent on assignment because of a running feud with the Emperor to be.The run in with Caligula was over a slave purchased by Burton, a Greek named Demetrius played by Victor Mature. Both Burton and Mature are exiled to Judea and they arrive just in time to see Jesus enter Jerusalem. Mature becomes converted to Jesus's teachings and Burton is driven mad by the enormity of what he has participated in. The Robe was written by Lloyd C. Douglas who was an ordained Lutheran minister and who turned to writing at the age of 50 with his first best seller Magnificent Obsession. His writings were of the Christian inspirational variety and he was a very popular American writer right up to his death in 1951. Richard Burton got one of his Academy Award nominations for his role. Jean Simmons as Diana who was the main source of his rivalry with Caligula gives a good understated performance of the woman who stood by the man she loved and his fate and passed up a chance to be an Empress.Jay Robinson as Caligula got most of the notice. Although John Hurt in the I Claudius series is probably now the definitive Caligula, Robinson's performance holds up very well indeed. A substance abuse problem curtailed a promising career and though he did come back it was not the same.The Robe was 20th Century Fox's first film in its new wide screen process of Cinemascope and really should be seen in a letter box version at home. Richard Burton is always good and elevates whatever film he's in.Though in this case the subject matter is elevated just about as high as it can get.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA1MDYwMTAtYmM5ZC00M2VkLTljOWYtY2JiMWMyMDY5Y2NjL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Still this movie didn't dumb down the dangers of real violence, international terrorism, espionage, and dangerous people. A movie made like this today would make the kid a genius and the bad guys clumsy and stupid. I do miss serious films like this for kids. They never dumbed it down and took the audience seriously. Movies like Poltergeist, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Dark Crystal (Which scared me to death), The Neverending Story, and more always played to the intelligence of the audience. Now all we have is fart jokes and one-note slapstick.

When her mother disappears one day, the police think she's probably run off, perhaps with a boyfriend; Kat thinks her mother just got so fed up with her boring, empty, perfect-housewife life that she finally left it to find something better. Kat herself doesn't know how she feels about that; truly, she doesn't really feel much of anything, especially because her mother had recently been so intrusive in her life. Her father seems meek and lost after her mother leaves, but both of them will eventually have to pick up the pieces and go on. If only Kat would stop having those disturbing dreams about where her mother might be....This is really far more of a coming-of-age story than it is anything else; aside from some dream images, there's very little that would fit the term ""fantastical,"" even though I saw it at Montreal's Fantasia Festival. There is some very fine acting, from Eva Green as the mother, Shailene Woodley as Kat, Christopher Meloni as Kat's father and Thomas Jane as a police detective, and both writer/director Gregg Araki (from the novel by Laura Kasischke) and the cast do a very good job of capturing that confusing stage of adolescence, where one is not quite fully grown up but is certainly not at all a child anymore either.

It involves a young teenage girl (Solene Rigot) who is still an inexperienced virgin despite some casual fumblings with a male ""friend with benefits"". When a perhaps older, and definitely more experienced, girl (Audrey Bastien) moves in next door to her, they become friends, and the virgin follows the promiscuous neighbor into various sexual adventures like a near threesome with an older bartender (in a hotel room adjoining the room of one of the girl's parents), and later an actual threesome while on the standard French-movie holiday.What I hated about ""Thirteen"" was the alarmist and hypocritically moralistic attitude. Everybody knows that many teenagers have sex, and a lot of males vividly remember having sex with teenage girls when they were teenagers or a little older. There's no good reason to shy away from the subject like American films do (except maybe in PG-13 movies actually aimed at impressionable teenagers), and if you're worried about creepy male adults, there's certainly no shortage of ""barely legal"" XXX porn in America--I doubt they bother much with movies like this. French movies don't necessarily glamorize teen sex, but they don't treat it as purely comical and consequence-free when the protagonist are horny teenage guys, and then turn around and become horribly alarmist when the protagonists are teenage girls. They treat it seriously, but also in a more matter-of-fact and in less judgmental matter.The two actresses in ""Thirteen"" were actually about fifteen at the time and easily looked 20, so even though they didn't show nudity or anything, they did NOT exactly de-glamorize teen sex, and as a result the movie seemed more than a little hypocritical. The actresses in this actually are over 18, but look younger, especially Solene Rigot. Her sex scenes are less graphic, but perhaps a little uncomfortable because she genuinely looks about 15. The more mature-looking Audrey Bastien has full-frontal nudity and pretty graphic sex scenes, but even this actually feels more honest and less exploitative than most American films on this subject.The one problem though is the end, which I won't reveal, but it's a VERY common plot twist in French movies like ""In a Wild Moment"" and ""Girls Can't Swim"" that probably has less to do with the real-life behavior of teenage girls than it does the sex fantasies of middle-age men. The female director can't help but indulge in this too, but it is not treated in a very exploitative manner (and is the least graphic of the sex scenes). I also appreciated that the very end was not the consequence-free ending of ""In a Wild Moment"" OR the ridiculously melodramatic ending of ""Girls Can't Swim"", even if some reviewers did find it frustratingly open-ended.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWY4YmIyZjgtOWNhYi00OTliLTkwZjEtOTE1Zjg1NTA3MDJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ0MzMwNQ@@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

One must beg the question, of whether perhaps I got ripped off.Sorceress is bad. Astronomically bad. Not the kind of bad that we're used to. No, not mediocre Hollywood bad. It's so bad, it's almost a religious experience.The plot boils down to this: King/wizard Traigon promises his goddess, Kalgara (a big floating head that hisses and spits green lasers) to sacrifice his first-born child, for no apparent reason. However, he is quite bemused when his wife bears twins, making it difficult to discern which is the first-born. Deciding to resolve the question of their hierarchy later, he is about to seize the two infants, when he is killed by a Moses resembling, kung-fu fighter named Chronos or Chrona or some such. Chronos drops the twins off with some peasants and leaves. Years later, the FEMALE twins, named Mira and Mara, have been raised to believe themselves boys. A falsehood that is neither seen through by themselves OR the other characters in the movie, presumably because they wear hats. Anyhow, Traigon comes back from the dead (again, for no apparent reason) and orders his minions to find the `two who are one' (the twins.) An order which they fulfil almost instantaneously. After murdering the twins' adoptive family, the minions are made short work of by the plucky Mira and Mara, who are armed with big sticks. They also glow blue (once again, for no apparent reason.) After the evil minions are defeated, Baldar the big red Viking emerges from his hiding place behind the bushes to compliment the two young `men' on their fighting prowess. Then Chronos shows up and immolates himself in a bonfire (say it with me now `for no apparent reason'.) Anyhow, the remaining characters go on a quest of some sort, and are joined by Erlich the half-naked, befroed imbecile and the horribly perverse Pando the goat-boy (perhaps the most hateable character of all time.) Memorable scenes include: Mira and Mara emerging naked from the lake, to discover Pando the goat-boy grinning and ""bah""ing at them in an entirely unwholesome way. (`What's that?' asks Mira or Mara `Which he carries there. Hanging between his legs. Is it a horn?' `A weapon perhaps?' adds Mara or Mira. `But how would he use such a weapon?' Then they beat the crap out of Pando and he runs crying.) Erlich's witty repertoire with the big, hairy, gravel-voiced gambler. (`Well, barbarian,' scoffs the semi-shaven wookie, in a dubbed on voice resembling a broken radiator, `don't dogs have ears? Don't they speak?' `We have ears,' replies Erlich, grinning like a lobotomy patient and holding two fingers on the sides of his head, `And we speak. Arf! Arf!') Mira and Mara's discovery of their actual gender. (`You're girls,' gasps Erlich as he sees the naked twins. `What do you mean?' asks Mira or Mara, confusedly. `I mean, you're not boys,' explains Erlich. `We're not?' wonders Mara or Mira. `Not boys? Are you sure?') Krakinon, the soldier who needs to cut down on the coffee, screaming with his eyes bugging out. (You really have to see it. It's a riot.) A butt-naked Erlich, sliding down a greased poll, where a sharpened stick waits for him in a VERY bad position below. (IÃÂ cannot describe the horror of this scene in mere words.) Mira or Mara feeling the effects of Erlich and Mara or Mira's `love boogey' miles away and reacting to it, causing Pando to become `excited.' (`Now I KNOW its Erlich,' comments Baldar as he stares at the moaning Mira or Mara, leaving us with the question of just HOW he knows. Suddenly, Pando rushes towards her and is stopped by Baldar. `She's under my protection,' warns Baldar. Frustrated, Pando begins to jump up and down and `bah' as heÃÂ as heÃÂ AAAAH! MUST GET THE MENTAL PICTURE OUT OF MY HEAD! NOOOOO!) A ""battle between the gods' that consists of a poorly constructed winged lion and a floating head growling and hissing at each other, until one blows up. Two words: horny undead. And Pando leading an army of goats and goat herders into Traigon's palace, where theyÃÂ just kinda mill around for, you guessed it, no apparent reason.There are so many more memorable scenes, but I don't think I have the stomach to convey them to you. However, I will add that the movie ends on a pro-polygamist note, as Erlich rationalizes, `Hey, these two ARE one.'I heartily recommend this film to masochists, as well as perverts who might find Pando's `antics' arousing.Did I mention that this film declines to feature any kind of  `sorceress' whatsoever?","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDVhZGM4YTItMjFmYy00MjVmLWIyZTctN2Q2ODk1MTJmYjQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Who wanted it to be made and how it cast a spell on the entire bloodline of the man who eventually created it. We're introduced to 3 generations of the Merchant family (all played by Bruce Ramsey); one in 18th century Paris, one in the present day and the last one in a future galaxy far, far awayÃÂ Opinions on this storyline may differ a lotÃÂeither you think it's very idiotic and far-fetched orÃÂoriginal and dared. The initial atmosphere and setting by Clive Barker has completely vanished, yet the morbid surrounding remains and several sequences are still very creepy and unsettling. Hellraiser: Bloodline contains quite a lot of exquisite slaughtering and the charismatic presence of Pinhead (Doug Bradley) still is an extra horror-value. Pinhead ÃÂ accompanied by a pet puppy this time ÃÂ still knows how to killÃÂtoo bad he talks too much and his vicious speeches tend to get boring quickly. Best aspects in this production are the newly introduced `cenobites' and the occult Parisian portrait. Giant turn-offs are the weak script, the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to Barker's initial masterpiece. Although not highly memorable itself, Bloodline stands as the last watchable Hellraiser film. After this sequel, the series went downhill completely. So far, 2 more sequels came out (2 more are still in process) and neither of those is worth seeing. Hellraiser:Bloodline suffered from a lot of production difficulties and the director eventually preferred to be credited as Alan SmitheeÃÂMeaning he doesn't want to be remembered as the director of it.

When I read the nutty plot description and noticed that it starred Ellen Dubin (from Lexx) and Denise Richards in an early role, I selected it out of curiosity. I expected to watch it for maybe five minutes and then get bored and turn to something else. I ended up, however, being really surprised by how entertaining I found this film to be. I knew I had to see what other people at IMDb thought about it. And just as I expected, almost everyone here hated it. I'm not surprised that most people don't ""get"" this movie. Those without any sense of camp will have no appreciation for it.Let me explain something to everyone: This movie is bad, and the people who wrote and directed it KNEW that they were making a bad movie. Most of the characters and things that go on in it are totally, utterly ridiculous, and the filmmakers obviously reveled in this fact, to a degree of aggressive silliness. Realism and reality have little to do with this film. Basically, it's a send-up of other B-movies--romance, sci-fi, horror, etc--and a clever one at that. But apparently very few seem to have recognized it as such. Do people really think that the filmmakers were just too dumb not to realize that real-life funeral-goers would have noticed a huge T-rex watching the burial service from behind some shrubs just a few yards away? Or that the creepiness of the tender love scenes between Tammy and her grotesque dinosaur ""boyfriend"" was an accident? The movie's deliberate outrageousness and low-mindedness is what makes this movie fun and is the source of some of its funniest moments. For the first half of the film, I couldn't believe what I was watching, and couldn't believe that anyone would make a film like this.And then I loved it!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjczNmY0MDEtMzBiMi00NDRhLWE1OTQtYzRlN2UxOTNlYWUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ4NDY5OTc@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I simply forgot it, lumped it in with the other, countless horror films I've seen and will never see again.  However, I recently rediscovered it...and was completely awestruck.  The theatrical release did not do the film justice.  It dropped priceless minutes of film and much need footage. I strongly urge you to seek out the uncut director's version on DVD format.

But I promise you there is a horror spectacle buried under there.  It may be a little slow going at times...but all that build-up makes whatever happens all the more effective.

Watch the dinner scene with the crofters, in which he manages to convey his plight to the wife entirely without words. Great acting. Also the wickedly funny bravura piece at the political rally.Madeleine Carroll must be among the coolest and feistiest of Hitchcock's favoured blondes, not as insipid or irrelevant as many of the others were. She is a veritable icicle and it takes a long time for her to thaw, but then watch the sparks fly.I feel a little sad for the people who cannot be bothered to check out this movie because of the tinny sound or the b&w photography.

Suddenly, people in her town are mysteriously healed--but fame soon takes its toll.","54","A Christian movie with powerful performances.","The Girl Who Believes In Miracles is a lukewarm Christian movie with a weak storyline. The few heartwarming scenes aren't quite enough to keep this film afloat. With a strong performance by the ensemble's youngest actress, the movie does not have enough storytelling to deliver a wholly satisfying movie experience.The Girl Who Believes In Miracles centers around a little girl named Sarah (Austyn Johnson) who has seen God and can grant miracles. She helps cancer patients, and even blind and paralyzed teens. All the while, Sarah's fame increases, with people knocking on her door to grant miracles. Sarah's health declines, too, but she keeps up her faith.The movie makes it clear from the beginning that Jesus is praised, and that this is not a modern version of the Messiah's story. It is unclear, though, why Sarah holds this power to grant miracles as she has done nothing significant except have faith. The Girl Who Believes In Miracles is confusing in this way and may leave the audience wondering, ""Can anyone be a Messiah?"" However, the actors deliver empowering performances. In the scenes in which Sarah's health weakens, her suffering is absolutely heartbreaking. Austyn really has the audience pulling for her. Sarah's grandfather, Sam (Peter Coyote), also has a heartfelt monologue in which he talks to God and says he would rather die than Sarah. His love shines through, along with his pain, creating a tear-jerking scene.The moral of this film is to always let faith guide you. Even as Sarah's health declines, she never loses her faith. She stands by God and understands that everything happens for a reason, unlike her family who try to fight the ticking clock. As a Christian, I did find the film somewhat offensive in its message that anyone with faith can perform miracles.I give The Girl Who Believes In Miracles 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18, plus adults.

Bailey, George Gaynes, Michael Winslow, David Graf","36,236","The Russian government hires the veterans of thePolice Academy(1984) to help deal with the Mafia.","110","""They've been doing this act for over a hundred years.""","What is it that's so resolutely unfunny about Mission to Moscow? Is it the lifeless direction? The disinterested performances? The lack of atmosphere? The joke-free script? It's all of these things, of course, but there's also something inexplicably poor about it that you just can't quite put your finger on.The regulars are the major weak point. While the guest cast have the misjudged enthusiasm to irksomely overact, all the usual culprits seem embarrassed by the whole thing. None of them sell their underwritten, reheated lines, and the fact that Bubba Smith and Marion Ramsey failed to sign up is a damning indictment. What comes through the screen, from George Gaynes to David Graf, is the sense of souls bleeding. ""Please get me a proper job, there must be a better way to pay my mortgage"" these actors scream with every fibre of their being. Leslie Easterbrook gets her usual single ""my character's got big breasts"" joke - why does she even bother to sign up for this crap? Michael Winslow looks old, tired, and frankly bored with the whole thing. Was his involvement only confirmed at the last minute? Because while he gives a curiously muted performance throughout, the script also fails to accommodate his talents in almost any way. Note that this is the ONLY Police Academy sequel in which he doesn't do his (admittedly run into the ground) ""Bruce Lee"" schtick.Police Academy managed to keep up the same level of quality between films three to six - they were all rubbish. But even by their low standards Mission to Moscow plumbs the depths, making Citizens on Patrol look like Annie Hall. New recruit Charlie Schlatter, there for the completely incongruous love interest theme, is never funny and the Russian characters are the crass stereotypes you'd expect. Any film that promises ""we're going to kick buttski"" is clearly dumber than is tolerable, and a tasteless reference to Chernobyl doesn't help matters.The only Police Academy film made outside the 80s, it was produced five years after the last one - why?!!?? Was there a big demand in the market for sh*te? Some cartoon sound effects (whistles, birdcall, etc.) are added to the action to try and pep things up, but this really is a DOA of a movie. True to form (or should that be formula?) it ends with an extended chase sequence that is neither suspenseful nor convincing.Just look at scenes like the one where G.W. Bailey gets hit in the face with stew. The stew is clearly missing his face and just lands on his chin, so Bailey (the only regular who tries) moves his face so that the full brunt of the stew will land on it. This dedication to duty is admirable, but also perfectly highlights the sloppy desperation of the whole thing. The series' move from the teen fodder of the first two, 15 certificate, movies had been subverted into the last five, PG cert entries. This is at its lowest ebb here; a comedy that seems wholly aimed at the under-5s and doesn't know what to do with its characters. Russian acrobats entertain the kiddies while its ... er... ""stars""... are left to stand around like second bananas, giving unfunny reaction shots.Maybe it's the ""fish out of water"" feel of it all, with the somewhat flat Russian espionage themes failing to ignite. But whatever it is, Mission to Moscow feels like a TV sitcom with the canned laughter track removed. In any other franchise this would be described as an ""unfortunate, sad end"" to the series. With Police Academy however, finishing with one of the unfunniest comedies of all time seems strangely apt. 2/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM5MzA3YTMtZDZkNy00YzNlLWFkZTUtZDJhYTNkMzk1ODNlL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Dennis Quaid stars as Remy McSwain, an eleven year veteran of the New Orleans Police Department, who from the day he joined the force learned that the 'perks' that went along with the job were all just a natural, acceptable part of the way things are done in the city they call The Big Easy. It's just the way it is; and all is well until Assistant District Attorney, Anne Osborne (Ellen Barkin), shows up one day, and becomes inordinately concerned with a recent 'wise guy' murder Remy is investigating. And it isn't long before things start to get a bit sticky for Remy and a few others who suddenly find themselves caught with their fingers in the cookie jar. But there are indications that something is going down at the precinct that is somewhat more serious than the penny-ante graft apparently being enjoyed by a number of New Orleans' finest, and Osborne's job is to get to the bottom of it. Remy, however, doesn't buy the idea that there are 'dirty' cops amongst his own, and quickly puts some moves on Anne to find out what she thinks she knows. And it starts him off along a path which, before it's over, he may wish he hadn't opted to tread.From the opening credits, as McBride takes you aloft and opens up his camera for a thrilling shot of the bayous and countryside rushing by below (backed by the blood stirring zydeco music that drives the entire film), he saturates the story with an atmosphere that brings New Orleans to life. And the vibrant sights and sounds of the city (including the engaging Creole dialects), are so richly textured that the city itself becomes as much an integral part of the story as many of the characters. As Remy would say in greeting, with his best prepossessing grin in place, 'Where you at, chere?'And though the story itself is nothing especially original, the lively presentation and the mood McBride sets, as well as some unique characterizations and that special sense of time and place he captures, make it all seem fresh and new. The zydeco music, alone, is a treat and-- like the city-- is something of a character in itself.Quaid fairly oozes Southern charm as the irrepressible Remy, a guy secure with his world and sure of his place in it. He's obstinate and self-assured, but without being pretentious, which makes it easy to like him. The natural fluidity of his distinct mannerisms and speech give his performance a ring of authenticity that makes Remy very real and entirely believable-- which, of course, adds credibility to the story. The character is a good fit for Quaid, and he definitely makes the most of it.Barkin does a good job, as well, as Anne, employing her trademark crooked smile to great effect, and she has a genuine chemistry with Quaid that works well for the story. She brings a decided definition to her character, making Anne a woman who is strong without being overconfident, and not immune to vulnerability; it's her very humanness, in fact, that make her so accessible. It's a well rounded performance that allows you to see beneath the facade of the professional cop doing her job, to the very real person within. Barkin plays it all very well, and lets you know that there's more to Anne than meets the eye.Notable in supporting roles are Grace Zabriskie, as Remy's mother, and Charles Ludlam as Lamar Parmentel. Their performances are great examples of the value of a good character actor, and the significant impact they can have on a film. Far too often they go unnoticed and unappreciated.The supporting cast includes Ned Beatty (Jack), John Goodman (Andre), Lisa Jane Persky (McCabe), Ebbe Roe Smith (Ed), Tom O'Brien (Bobby), Marc Lawrence (Vinnie the Cannon) and Solomon Burke (Daddy Mention). Like a good bowl of spicy gumbo, 'The Big Easy' packs a wallop and will give you a good helping of satisfying entertainment, well worth the two bucks or so you plunk down for it. And by the time it's over, you'll be calling people 'chere' and fighting the urge to strap a washboard to your chest. So, hey-- where you at? It's the magic of the movies, chere. I rate this one 8/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMyODlmYjMtMTJkMi00MjZmLTgzYmMtYzllM2FhZWJmOTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Kennedywas assassinated.","79","A numbing experience of the horror before conspiracy theories emerged.","A certain generation gained its knowledge of the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy from Oliver Stone's JFK. Don't get me wrong, JFK remains a fine film, but there's a danger of believing the conspiracies are factual. Parkland, Peter Landesman's directorial debut, doesn't necessarily right any wrongs but it does approach the assassination with a clean slate.Parkland unfolds the story we are all familiar with, but manages to shock thoroughly as it recounts the events of 22 November 1963 and the immediate aftermath before the conspiracy theories and thoughts of dark dealings beyond the obvious murder emerged. Landesman manages to numb us, playing our own horror and sense of helplessness across the faces of the protagonists before us as their innocence is lost and their faith in humanity is rocked.Central to Parkland is Abraham Zapruder (Paul Giamatti), the man who inadvertently shot one of the most important 26.6 seconds of film in American history: the arrival of the President's cavalcade and his harrowing, public execution at the hands (probably) of Lee Harvey Oswald. We watch Giamatti's Zapruder evolve from confident boss to shuddering, emotional mess as he realizes just what he has recorded and the impact that footage will have on the world and his own life. It is very easy to view Zapruder as a fortunate man, a man who in a lucky half minute, shot himself fame and financial security, but Giamatti flawlessly portrays a man who just might crumple permanently under the weight and pressure from the police, the Secret Service, the press...At every turn in Parkland there is another character recoiling in their own horror, undergoing their own life-changing trauma, and each is played with the sensitivity demanded in order for Parkland not to be a mawkish, voyeuristic experience.After last year's The Paperboy (but overlooking the awful The Lucky One), it's definitely time to take Zac Effron seriously as an actor. As Doctor Charles 'Jim' Carrico, the young doctor called upon to put his own emotions aside and fight for the life of his President as the First Lady weeps in the corner holding a chunk of her husband's brain, he looks shell shocked and as numbed by the events as we feel. Subtler is James Badge Dale as Robert Oswald, another man whose life is irrevocably changed by the actions of a man, who happens to be his brother. At first shocked by the shooting, he retreats into himself as realisation dawns, emerging only to castigate his deluded mother, Marguerite (Jacki Weaver), who sees an opportunity for fame and hero's honours for her youngest son.But Parkland is such a powerful film for much more than the performances. They say the devil is in the detail and it is the minutia that kicks us in the gut the hardest. The obvious is overlooked in favour of the finer points. We never see the Zapruder film clearly or in its entirety but the sound of Jim Carrico pumping the President's chest while the gathered crowd watches silently and without hope, goes right through us. The handle of the coffin torn off as the agents lift it out of the hearse, the panic as they realise it will not fit into Air Force One, the hasty removal of the aircraft panel with saw and shoulder... They all serve to make the situation real, the horror genuine and immediate. Landesman has created a film of morality; not just the obvious judgment towards murder, but the more difficult matters of a church burial for a man despised by the population, the suspicion thrown at the family and the blame levied at those who could have prevented the act if they had had the benefit of foresight. Parkland is an emotional journey the delivers a series of punches to leave us reeling. Yes, we know the story, even though we may not have even breathed our first breath in 1963, but have we experienced the emotion before now?For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2NjkwNDE2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY5ODIxMDE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

How they evoke their hurt feelings and their humanity within on th screen is why these are such sought performers. The viewer cannot help but feel what they feel, nor can one help wanting to cheer them when they're together.Yes, there are several action scenes involving angry corrupt cops, but they only spice it up a little, and are not a significant part of the movie.For the lover of music, Dave Grusin provides a superb Jazz based background, featuring trumpeter Terrence Blanchard. Like the actors, Grusin shows why he is one of the most sought musical consultants in the movie business. Blanchard shows why he's one the premiere trumpeters on the scene.Not a movie for the lovers of guts, blood, and gore.

But what of the man himself?  His passions, his loves?  The humanness behind the genius?  `Immortal Beloved,' written and directed by Bernard Rose, examines the man behind the music in a dramatization focusing on the mystery behind a letter-- written by Beethoven-- found among his effects after his death in 1827.  The letter bears no name or address, but was written to a woman to whom he refers as his `immortal beloved,' with nary a clue as to her identity.  But in his final will, it is she to whom he bequeaths his estate, and it therefore falls to Beethoven's secretary, Anton Schindler (Jeroen Krabbe), to unravel the mystery and discover her identity.  And as Schindler pursues his quest, a portrait of Beethoven, in his most human aspect, emerges. 	Reminiscent of the approach taken by Orson Welles with `Citizen Kane,' Rose presents a riveting study of the enigmatic genius that was Beethoven.  He suggests a man driven by passion and ego, who was under appreciated during his lifetime (as great artists often are), and who grew bitter in the wake of the slings and arrows fate so surreptitiously hurled at him.  The great irony of his life, of course, was the deafness that deprived him of the aural beauty of his own creation, an affliction Rose implies was brought about through the brutality of a drunken father who would beat his son about the head and ears (And in retrospect, what a testimony to his genius, that he could write such music in his head without ever hearing an actual note). 	As Beethoven, Gary Oldman gives an outstanding performance, one for which he should have received acclaim that somehow was never forthcoming.  His ability to create a total character, with such incredible emotional depth as he does here, is astounding.  It's puzzling as to why so many of his performances are overlooked, especially at Oscar time.  Besides this film, consider his work in `Sid and Nancy,' or more recently in `The Contender.' He is simply a tremendous actor who has yet to have his day in the sun.  As Beethoven, he so completely immerses himself in the character that his soul is veritably reflected in his eyes.  You feel the silent world in which he was confined for most of his life, and it allows you to identify with the inner turmoil with which he had to cope and endure without respite.  Most importantly, Oldman makes you feel that unabashed passion that motivated and drove Beethoven on.  It's quite simply a remarkable performance.  Turning in notable performances as well are Isabella Rossellini, as Anna Marie Erdody, one of the women in Beethoven's life who may or may not have been the one to whom the letter was intended, and Johanna ter Steege, as Johanna, Beethoven's sister-in-law and the mother of his beloved nephew, Karl (Marco Hofschneider). 	The supporting cast includes Miriam Margolyes (Nanette), Barry Humphries (Clemens), Valeria Golino (Giulietta), Gerard Horan (Nikolaus), Christopher Fulford (Casper), Alexandra Pigg (Therese) and Luigi Diberti (Franz). Beethoven's renown today, of course, exceeds even mythological proportions, which often facilitates the blending of fiction with fact.  But with `Immortal Beloved,' whether or not the finer points are historically accurate or not is of little consequence, for at it's heart this is a love story that is engrossing drama that is altogether transporting.  It's a memorable film, highlighted by Oldman's performance and, of course, the music.  And there are a number of scenes, as well, that are unforgettable and demand mention.  One depicting the debut performance of the `Ode to Joy,' and another in which the young Beethoven (played by Leo Faulkner) runs at night through the streets of the city to escape his drunken father (Fintan McKeown), coming at last to a lake, into which he wades to float on his back; and with the camera positioned directly above, looking down upon him, a billion stars are reflected in the water around him.  Then slowly the camera pulls back until the young Ludwig blends with the reflected stars to seemingly take his place among all the brightest lights of the firmament. It's a scene that will leave you breathless and remain etched in your memory forever.  And it's but one of the more astounding moments from an astounding motion picture that absolutely must not be missed.  I rate this one 10/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTgyZTYzZGItYzIzMi00YTBkLTk0ZTktOTg2ZTM3NDcwYjAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I thought Roman Polanski did great respects to the story and to Dickens. I thought all of the performances were well done and Ben Kingsley was just amazing. I have been in the production of Oliver! the musical three times and have read the book about a million times. It is one of my all time favorite stories and plays and I have been disappointed with the past Oliver Twist films. I remember a few years ago I saw a very poorly done Oliver Twist with Elijah Wood as the Artful Dodger. This one did not disappoint me as a huge fan in the least. I feel Roman Polanski really understood what Dickens was trying to express in his books. And by the way, the character Oliver is supposed to faint, it is a sign of his weakness. I know I am repeating myself but I really did love the performances. The Artful Dodger was great and Mr.Salsbury was done so justly. Even the smallest characters were performed amazingly. I think the only way someone would foolishly call this off as a poorly written, poorly acted, or poorly done film was if they were blind and deaf! No offense to anyone who is of course, but I was very taken aback, as I said, by the comment I just read about this film. The only thing it has against it is that it's a bit long. I knew where the story was going at every moment but for someone just being introduced to Oliver Twist, it might seem to go on for a while. But if you look back at the history of movies, many of the best films are long. If you are a fan of Charles Dickens, please see this film - you will love it. If you are a fan of Roman Polanski it is one of his best! If you wish to be entertained in a very classic and non-offensive way, please see this film. I just loved it and could go on and on.

It simply is one of the best horror movies made in the seventies and I can't think of many aspects about it that are negative. First of all it stars Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. There.that should already be enough as a recommendation. These gentlemen are one THE greatest duo in horror ever and they didn't do their finest work just for Hammer Studio's exclusively. And the fun doesn't stop with these two icons.Horror Express also stars Telly `Kojak' Savalas in a delightful role.  It's actually a shame that his screentime is rather limited because he manages to impress as much as Lee and Cushing. He clearly enjoyed playing Captain Kazan and he makes the most of his performance.But Horror Express has a lot more to offer than just good acting. It's a powerful and fascinating story that delivers a good old fashioned amount of scares and atmosphere. The entire story takes place on a old train which is the ideal setting for a film like this. The old and noisy carriages create a unique atmosphere of claustrophobia and the `nowhere to run'-element is used to the max. The plotline itself surprisingly good and it keeps you alert during the entire movie. This is also thanks to the several other, interesting topics that are included in the movie like anthropology, religion and the evolution-theory. Sure, the entire screenplay is illogical and the plot contains as many holes as a small Swiss cheese but - seriously - who cares. I prefer this kind of silly inspiration and creativity a million times over the horror crap they make nowadays !! Horror Express is - simply put - a must see ! I'd even say it's essential viewing if you're looking for the highlights in the genre.  It's original, creepy ( even pretty bloody and violent ), it contains enough humor to moderate things and most of all.it's very entertaining. Climb on board and find yourself a seat.Horror Express is one movie you won't regret watching !!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYzMjEwYzUtNjZlZC00OWUzLWJhNjMtZWIxMTQ2Njg0YTIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Also it does not just have one hidden truth - there will be multiple reveals here. And the whole thing is based on history, on real events (as a friend of mine told me). Which makes it almost necessary to dig in and find out more about actual events (because as happens often, this surely has done some heightened reality, which the beginning suggest too).The characters are well drawn, but also quite complicated. Also for people who may not watch too many Korean or Asian movies in general and have to concentrate on the subtitles, they may have some issues to distinguish the two main characters from time to time - no pun intended here either. Being confused about them may help elevate the suspense even further actually. Guessing game and all that.Action scenes are more than well shot and the twists will keep you guessing from start to finish. Just do not expect this to ... resolve things the way you want it too. South Koread has a dark history too - they were apparently not always as free as they are now. And the movie is not shy about that fact.

The acting is great, the writing is real, and the directing is moving.There are few lines that are somewhat cringy but as far as the writing goes, these lines fit into the general awkwardness and inexperience that comes along with teenage-hood. These actors are great in their roles. I really believe that they have a connection and really care about them. The screenplay, I believe, is very well done. And the directing helps create this emotional energy that I cannot explain.I, in my own experience as a lesbian, relate to this movie so much. There are some scenes in the movie that I can just feel the emotion that the actors are trying to get across. It is so eloquently portrayed that I cannot help but feel a connection to it.

It seems too many viewers today are looking to disengage their brain and be spoon-fed a story-line where all character arcs are complete and all questions answered - sad really. I appreciated the fact that this movie allowed us to view a complex and dynamic relationship, and afterwards do our own critical thinking and take some personal meaning away from the story.I'm also particularly amused by the hypocritical puritan nut-jobs who lambasted the film by judging Gina's actions as a negative commentary on the entire female gender - get real people!! The intent is a realistic story setting, and in reality humans actually do have sex and are fallible (have affairs/become jealous).

"Lions for Lambs","2019.0","UA","92.0","Crime, Drama, Mystery","6.2","47.0","Robert Redford","Tom Cruise, Meryl Streep, Robert Redford, Michael PeÃÂ±a","52,760","Injuries sustained by two Army rangers behind enemy lines in Afghanistan set off a sequence of events involving a congressman, a journalist and a professor.","253","Though heavy handed, remarkably fair","Lions for Lambs is a current issue film that deals with several relevant topics. The central plot revolves around essentially three settings that don't directly affect each other through action. They do however affect each other through course of action presented in debate. Cruise plays Jasper Irving, a GOP senator with a new plan of action for the war on terror. Streep is a veteran reporter who is interviewing him. Simultaneously, Redford is a college professor who has called a student into his office. A conflict in Afghanistan is taking place which is linked to the aforementioned plot lines.Lions for Lambs surprised me with it's balance. I'm an open Republican, and felt that this movie was not a clichÃÂ© attack against the power that be. The Cruise character could have been given irrefutable hatred material. He could have been caught in a scandal. He could have alienated others with religious furor. Instead he is real and forms educated arguments. He seems rational, and passionate; he can also make a turn to present himself to the public. I don't see this as an attack, but one of the many skills politicians need to succeed. With all they go through and the decisions they have, they don't want the mocking that crying before the camera would carry. The left is represented by Redford's professor and Streep's reporter. Both are treated with rationale conviction. Neither has a clear anti-GOP agenda. Both of these characters even go as far as to acknowledge the error in the ways of their side. If there is a message to the film, it is that we are being sheltered from reality. It was clear to this viewer that Redford is stating that we are placing focus on the minuscule while matters of true importance are treated as second rate. Surely this is something we all can agree on in Lions for Lambs and this comes into fruition as the film evolves.Aside from the political commentary, which it makes no dance around, this a dialog heavy film. Characters are pinned against their situations which cause them to restrain from a course of action both physically and metaphorically. The conversations are engaging, but it would be arguably more favorable to allow the characters interaction. A few additional technical merits could have gone a long way. For example, the CGI of the Chinook helicopter was not up to par; a memorable score and unique cinematography are also absent. The screenplay is inherently foiled by remarkable coincidence; but there was no way around that. At a scant 88 minutes, Lions for Lambs is quick to get to the point but it is over too fast. These miscues keep it from perfection. Served as they are, Lions for Lambs is thinking person's film that comes highly recommended.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyMzc0MzYyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM2NDk0NA@@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

However the dark edge of the movie was a bit too much for me and I felt as a children's tale it was probably a bit too scary.Don Bluth returned in '91 to film the sequel to his last hit, this one a satire of the westerns. Fievel the mischievous mouse returns as his parents are shipping off to Green River to escape the cats, led by Cat R. Wall (voiced by John Cleese).Along the way a spider (voiced by Jon Lovitz) tries to kill Fievel and he falls off the train, into the desert, where he pines for his feline friend from the first film (voiced by Dom DeLuise).Eventually Fievel finds his way out of the desert and finds a dog-sheriff (voiced by Jimmy Stewart) who decides to help train him so that he can fight off Cat R. Wall, who has moved out west to spread his reign of terror.I enjoy this movie more than the first one because it's not as dark (something I just have a problem with in a kid's movie). The satire isn't as strong and the whole WWII edge is lost but it still retains the cats vs. mice, which is a nice element.The animation in my opinion is more classical and the musical sequences are more lively. The voice talents are far more impressive and I love Jimmy Stewart and John Cleese in this movie - talk about great casting! Overall this is better than the original and it surprises me that more people don't actually know about it. As a nice little family adventure film it's pretty entertaining and in terms of animation it represents everything Don Bluth is known for.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmUyOTE4YmItN2E0Zi00M2ViLWIxMTctMmZhMDRhMDZhOWZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjExODE1MDc@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"
"Libertate","2019.0","","109.0","Drama, Thriller, War","7.6","","Tudor Giurgiu","Alex Calangiu, Catalin Herlo, Ionut Caras, Iulian Postelnicu","1,292","During Romania's 1989 revolution, Sibiu witnesses a violent attack on a police station that spirals into armed clashes between soldiers, police, protesters and secret police.","7","Superb production value - Incomplete artistic vision","1. Great Production'Freedom' or 'Libertate' (2023), directed by Tudor Giurgiu and produced by Oana Giurgiu is a rare gem among the few pieces of Romanian filmography that takes a look at the events that have unfolded in Romania in December 1989. The experience is supremely immersive in part thanks to the speedy and well thought out camera movements (as if you are one of the background characters witnessing the story take place) and the incredible sound design and effects (complementing through your sense of hearing, your presence during these events). This effect is also achieved through the rather close-on-the-action camera and sound focus / angles / framing / sound design during dialogue or action-centric scenes. Everything, from the decor to the aftereffects, portrays a complete and profoundly immersive experience of the Revolution of '89 as seen from Sibiu, bringing about a feeling of 'Hollywood budget' production factor, for which the production team should be commended and which makes this movie a must-watch for all Romanians, especially those that have not lived through these events and would benefit immensely from adding this small point of reference to a vocabulary of insights on the history of their country.As far as the dialogue goes, the lines are beautifully savory, capturing the colorful vocabulary of the times and the spirit of the Romanian people through their language in the face of adversity (thanks in no small part to the flawless delivery if the actors and actresses). Sparkled with cliche-ic, modern, humorous moments here and there, the immersion is not broken and the overarching theme of the Romanian saying: ""Facem haz de necaz"" - or ""Poking fun when in trouble"" remains beautifully captured, something which the Romanian audience would clearly empathise with despite the colorless, hopeless and gruesome atmosphere.2. Lacking MessageThe other side of the coin here is what ended up feeling like an incomplete artistic vision on the part of the directing team. Vaguely put, after exiting the cinema you are left with a confusing feeling of not completely understanding the message of the movie - as if being presented with a perfectly executed cake on a random Tuesday at 13.00 and wondering to yourself what the occasion is. As other reviewers have put it, this movie is an exceptional radiography of the events that have unfolded in that period, but as with any radiography it necessitates a diagnostician that should walk the patient through the end result of a proper and digestible conclusion - perhaps not in the case of modern art, but for certain when it comes to historical movies. In the case of 'Libertate' the director's vision was either outshone by the focus on production and realism or diluted in the process, to the point where a viewer does not feel gently waltzed to an overarching message or concluding moral, as is usually the end goal of storytelling, regardless of medium. This may be due in part to an intentional neutrality of the directing vision or an accidental oversight as a result on the focus on the story itself, the research, and its delivery. Conclusions can still be drawn, however, but may have been left uncomfortably much at the discretion and subjective experiences of the viewer who is this case, regardless of generation, is looking less for freedom of opinion and more for answers over what has actually happened in '89 and who is responsible for the many deaths that occurred.Ironically the movie is portrayed and sold as a new and necessary look at the historic events that are still shrouded in mystery and censorship at the risk of being forgotten after 34+ years, but fails to deliver a stern position/opinion/message/new angle on such a controversial topic as if just as afraid to postulate one, just like the modern institutions it (and many others) accuses of the same fault. As if presented with an uninterpreted radiography, the viewer is purposefully left to make their own opinions on the story, symbolically similar to what led to the events back then - a general confusion based on the lack of a centrally delivered information, where everyone could only survive by making their own assumptions and accusing everyone else in the process, which ultimately led to the back and forth fighting and innocent casualties. Whether this vision was accidental or intentional and whether it will be a popular or unpopular one among audiences remains to be seen.3. OpinionsPersonally, I had the chance to experience the movie during its premiere at the old People's Palace, where the Romanian Communist Party Congresses took hold in the past, which is just in the vicinity of the building with the infamous balcony where Ceausescu was last seen in power before fleeing with the use of a helicopter. This, I believe, was a very inspired choice on the part of the organizing team. Soldiers in old uniforms were welcoming the audience silently as if to recreate the prisoners escort feel portrayed during the movie.In aspects pertaining to the political and macro context, the movie benefited from a hybrid sponsorship between centers and authorities from both Romania and Hungary, from the National Cinematography Center and Film Institute of Hungary to the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Culture from Romania, and numerous commercial sponsorship from high retail brands. This may have contributed to the rather politically neutral and uncontroversial, if not dutiful, perspective on the events. It delivered no more, no less than what is already known by most of the Romanian people about the Revolution (even though it tackled a story that is not widely shared), and does not try to shake the existing status-quo on the matter or provide answers to a topic littered in questions even today. On one hand, the movie may have assimilated the general reaction of the institutions that it has collaborated with in delivering a movie not meant to break the norms, on the other hand, its vision may have been a minimalist one from the start as if to say 'all we want to do is remind you that this happened, and not open a Pandora's box about the topic, and through this portrayal let you know that new events about something that happened 30+ years ago may still be uncovered, and that history is always worth researching'... then again perhaps not.4. ConclusionsThe movie remains an exceptional one and sets a new bar in terms of production value for the immersive experience it creates and its indirect educational effect as a result of that. Inevitably, when tackling such intense and emotionally packed topics, it will undoubtedly spark a political analysis and rekindling of the many questions on an entire nations mind - left yet unanswered. In that regard the movie had a modest if not tactfully avoidant stance, and has perhaps accidentally raised too high expectations (due to its marketing narrative and reported research into the events) for what its intended purpose was: to shed a simple and unambiguous light on one more small, yet important, story that unfolded during the events of '89, and not to provide closure to several generations. It succeded in reminding us that even in the absence of answers, or satisfying new insights, the people and the public should never stop asking the questions.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwOWU4MTUtYmYzNy00ZGIwLTg1MjEtMmYwOWQ5YTgxNTc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcwNDM0ODI@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

However, behind their apparent calm and repetitive existence, they are actually planning something sinister.","32","Burns its way into your psyche","Arguably, no greater cinematic interpreter of alienation exists in the world today than Austrian director Michael Haneke. Haneke shows us characters whose response to the world around them has deadened, people who have forgotten how to feel, how to love, how to care. The Seventh Continent, the first film of the trilogy that, with Benny's Video (1992) and 71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance (1994), depicts what Haneke has called ""my country's emotional glaciation."" Based on a true story of the disintegration of a middle class Austrian family, the film has little plot, only incident and observation. Divided into three parts and shot in episodic fragments, as in his 2002 film Code Unknown, each fragment is tenuously connected by fadeouts in which scenes start and end abruptly. A mood of banality is established early in an extended sequence in which a car moves through a car wash showing all the details of detergent sprays, high-pressure washers, and rotating brushes. At the end of the car wash is a travel poster beckoning tourists to visit Australia with a peaceful scene of sand and water, a motif that is repeated periodically during the film.The Schobers, husband George (Dieter Berner), wife Anna (Birgit Doll), and daughter Eva (Leni Tanzer), are the happily married family living next door. George is an engineer and Anna an optician. Eva is a bright child of about eight with deep, expressive eyes. The family moves through their morning ritual with precision -- brushing their teeth, feeding the fish, and eating breakfast with little conversation or emotional interaction. The camera avoids their faces, focusing on mundane objects such as a bowl of cereal, an alarm clock, a fish tank, a package of congealed broccoli. This preoccupation with objects underscores the lack of connection between the characters and the things they have acquired. We get our first hint that something is not right when Eva pretends to her teacher that she has lost her eyesight. Anna questions her about the incident, promising not to harm her if she tells the truth but, when Eva admits to the lie, suddenly slaps her across the face ignoring the fact that she is a very troubled little girl. It is from here that the cracks begin to widen. Depicting ritualistic actions like counting of money at a supermarket, the distractions of television, the meaninglessness of work, the film reflects the powerlessness and isolation of people in modern society. Haneke chronicles a family enslaved to the structures they have created, operating in a morass of emotional vacuity. The first hour may seem slow but it builds considerable tension until it reaches a shattering climax. Little by little the family disengages. George quits his job and writes letters to his parents hinting of something dark about to happen. In the absence of a spiritual core, without the possibility of meaningful action, the family sinks deeper into an abyss, unraveling and discarding the tightly woven structures of their life. Similar in theme to Todd Haynes' 1995 film Safe but with three times the power, The Seventh Continent is a ruthlessly intelligent film that burns its way into your psyche, leaving an indelible mark that will forever haunt your dreams.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQyZTgzNmEtMzk1My00NDZjLTllZTUtN2IzNGY1YjUxNjUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIzNDU1NTY@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

And I've probably hung out with both of their fathers before. I've been to the Far East. I've stayed in both better and worse places than the girls stayed. I had the pleasure of seeing the inside of a police station after I was robbed. I'm glad I had no more direct exposure to the local judicial system than that; that was more than enough. Everything in this movie seems awfully familiar to me.I think ""Brokedown Palace"" represents something pretty close to stark realism. It certainly reminded me of Asia.Of course it's true that the attitudes of the girls often don't do much to improve their situation. But they are meant to be an example of what not to do overseas. And the portrayal of some of the Thais did make me uncomfortable. But then many of my own personal travel anecdotes don't paint a complimentary picture either.This is a cautionary tale. An unfortunate consequence of too many people having too much money to spend these days is that you will find unescorted, unprepared, ""streetwise"", naive young people popping up in places where they have no business being. And when that happens, you end up with situations mirroring this movie.I suspect people choose to denigrate this one because they are too embarrassed to accept how true it is, and how vulnerable they would be if placed in similar circumstances.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWU4YjZmODktZDFmNC00MDU0LTliMTYtMDk1YjNmYjliMGZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The main problem with pulse is that in trying to be original it borrows from other films. I understand that this is an American version of a film from Japan. The film just reminded me of too many other films for me really to appreciate it. Once again this was a pre-screening and I am 100% sure that parts of the version I have seen will be changed. The other problem with pulse is that it is very hard to follow at times, and you are left to interpret the movie in your own way. The deaths are also very cheesy, and not really that creative. I am a huge horror fan and I was really interested to see this film because of the trailer that I very much enjoyed. The movie gets a boost in points for breaking away from the normal horror films we have been seeing as of late. Another thing that I had to pick at was the mediocre acting of the main star Kristen Bell. She just did not give a great performance...the rest of the cast with the exception of Ziagler give somewhat good performances. To continue on the scares were another part that bothered me..once again we see a pg13 movie relying on loud noises and crashes to make the audience jump...but on a brighter side there are a few scenes (the laundry room scene, and the car attack scene towards the end) that were actually pretty scary. One last thing the ending is not all that great, it is one of those things that you either love or hate...the audience at our screening mainly hated it, I will assume it will be changed come the release date. Overall ""Pulse"" is a decent horror film which is a step above the horror movies that I have seen as of late, just do not be surprised if you are left scratching your head after this film is over.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyOTg5MjY1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTM1ODYzMQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Neither of us knew anything about boxing. The coach put us both in the ring and said, ""Okay, let's see what you can do,"" or something equally Hemingwayesque. On the first half-hearted swing, Andy dealt me a glancing blow on the upper abdomen with a glove the size and density of a throw pillow. I went down on my knees and grabbed the ropes, thinking I might die from the pain. It had never occurred to me, watching the odd bout on TV, that every time one of those guys got punched -- it hurt! End of boxing career. This is the kind of movie in which, when somebody gets punched in the belly, he goes down and stays down. For several days. It's a movie for grown ups about grifters -- con people -- who work all sorts of games on one another. It's not ""The Sting,"" which is funny and which is about ""the big con,"" as it's evidently still called, requiring eons of preparation. This film is about people who cheat, artists in their own ways, but not theatrical producers.John Cusack is handsome in a pale way and delivers a decent performance as a young man who plays ""short cons"", clipping people out of nickels, dimes, and dollars, although he's been doing it long enough to put away something of a stash. Annette Bening, his girl friend, is much more into the life, with quite a history. She's very pretty too. She has a gracile figure and minces when she walks. In addition to the sleek clothes she occasionally has on in this film, she wears a big open-lipped smile, speaks in a breathless Marilyn Monroe whisper, and has eyes that sparkle with mischief and deceit. There is murder behind that grin.Angelica Huston is a puzzle. She's excellent here as a woman who works for Bobo, Pat Hinkle, a pudgy sadist, his best role in a generation. But her appearance is disturbing. It's as if, during childhood, her skeleton couldn't quite make up its mind about how mannish to become, how broad the shoulders should be, how high and boney the pelvic girdle. I don't mean that she is in any way unfeminine because she's not. It's simply that, knowing what her Dad looks like, I see the resemblance as so marked that it's kind of embarrassing to find her attractive.J. T. Walsh is perfect as the big con artist with that boyishly naive candor that sucks the marks in because it is nothing more than a psychopath's mask.He has a sympathetic, believable face, though he was stand-offish in person, and it's a shame that he died at such a relatively early age because he's always been a pleasure to watch. The story has some very dark undertones. It isn't just that Bening is trying to rope Cusak into the grifter's way of life, or that Huston and her son Cusak have been estranged for eight years, or that Huston is skimming off the top while working for Bobo the Dangerous, or that Cusak is trying to minimize his cons. These themes are interesting enough in themselves and would add up to something resembling ""House of Games."" But it's a lot more Freudian than that. Of all the forms of incest in the nuclear family, mother-son incest is the rarest. And when it happens, or even when the impulse manifests itself, it's a shocker. Huston and Bening, on first meeting, take an immediate dislike to one another and trade open insults. Bening: ""I'm Roy's friend."" Huston: ""I imagine you're a lot of peoples' friend."" Bening: ""Oh -- NOW I see. Yes, in the light you look easily old enough to be Roy's mother."" The hatred is based on a jealousy that only Bening is able to discern. Some outstanding script writing has gone on here. The lighting and photography are at least up to par, whether out of doors in the sunshine of a race track or indoors, in the dismal dump Roy lives in, the salmon-colored murk of his walls, lamps, and furniture and the clown portraits on black velvet. The score is based on an ironic tinkling oompah tune,"" although it turns emphatically dramatic when the situation calls for it, and it neatly sidesteps the conventions of the genre.Watch this if you have the chance. You'll think about it for some time afterward, the way I thought about that blow in the ring.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjNiYzg3OTUtYTQ2Mi00OTAwLWI4OGMtZGNkNDhmZDU4ZGRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I do wish Celeste Holm had been given more to do than just the duet with Frank Sinatra, Who Wants To Be a Millionaire. On Broadway Celeste Holm was a musical star with Oklahoma and Bloomer Girl to her credit, but MGM didn't want to recognize that.For this film, the story is reset from Philadelphia to Newport, Rhode Island to bring in the famous Jazz Festival. Philip Barry's social commentary is toned down and a very partisan Greek Chorus is added in the person of Mr. Louis ""Satchmo"" Armstrong. Satchmo tells you right up front who he's pulling for to win Grace Kelly and he helps musically along the way.Satch and Bing have that classic Now You Has Jazz duet, so successful was it that they did an album together a few years later. Bing Crosby during his life was crazy about jazz musicians and there was no one he liked better than Louis Armstrong. No one on the planet could resist that man's joy for living.Grace Kelly got a chance to bat 1000 in the recording industry. She was no singer as she would have freely admitted, but Cole Porter wrote True Love specifically to accommodate her limited range and when she does the last two bars of True Love with Der Bingle she got a million selling record for her one and only platter. As for Bing he got his 20th Gold record and the only one not with Decca records. True Love was nominated for Best Song at the Oscars but lost to Doris Day's Que Sera Sera which boomed all over the charts in 1956. It was sadly Cole Porter's last opportunity to win an Oscar for one of his movie songs.Frank Sinatra got a couple of good ballads in You're Sensational and Mind If I Make Love to You, but what he's best remembered for is that classic Well Did You Evah duet with Bing. Today's fans can't possibly appreciate the screen meeting of the two best and best known singers for the previous generations. A musical summit conference.High Society's tone is a lot lighter than the Philadelphia Story. The cast in terms of acting ability are not in the same league as Grant, Stewart, Hepburn, and Hussey. But folks it is a musical. I doubt those stars could have carried off the Cole Porter score.You can't miss with a cast like this, in either film for that matter.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWM2ODNhOTktMjgzMS00MmNhLTgwOGQtZTBiOGUwZTBjZDI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

There is not to blood, but there is many intelligent deaths with a furious touch. The direction and filming of the movie was very well used and the film caused some scares. When you watch the trailer, you realize it's predictable, but it is unfortunately. It's a good movie, despite a few clichÃÂ©s and is not a very scary movie. It's a thriller with a few strokes of horror.I hoped that Ashley Greene would act as the protagonist, but no.

I think Hoodlum fell victim to this epidemic.  With a bankroll of wonderful actors and actresses, and some of the best historical recreation of the locations, the movie delivers. The plot was simple, but it doesn't need to be complicated in a gangster flick like this.  It was based on real people, so the creators of the film cannot go ballistic on changing the story.  Maybe the 'critics' would like it better if it had a little green man who uses the force, or maybe a future crime prevention device.  Well, you won't find this here.  It's a wonderful, semi-true story about the way things were in Harlem and the surroundings areas back then.  Fishburn turned in a wonderful performance, and Roth played a great villian as he always does.  Just relax, and take it for what it's meant to be.

Cecilia is invited to Emma's bachelorette weekend where she gets stuck in a remote cabin with her high school bully and a taste for revenge.","66","More of a gory teen drama than a horror or comedy-horror","The basic premise of the film sounded interesting, and being an Aussie horror, you usually know to expect something a little bit crazy. They don't do things by halves down under, so you can expect the usual eye watering violence here and there.Unfortunately, if you're expecting something in the vein of The Loved Ones., Wolf Creek or 100 Bloody Acres, you're going to be disappointed. While it's not terrible, it doesn't quite reach its potential and ends up pretty forgetful and one you're unlikely to want to see again.Firstly, there isn't a single character with any redeeming quality, they're all pretty contemptible human beings and what sympathy you might initially have for the leading lady soon wears off. They're pretty much all contemptible nasty pieces of work in one way or another.Unfortunately it also suffers from the usual modern ""cool to include"" plot and character points, seemingly just to tick all of the boxes - ""being an influencer is the height of life/success"", a lesbian couple, a gay guy, a comment on white privilege, mental health, talking about ""cancelling"" someone, females who are just interested in love island ""reality"" tv etc.If the themes are not important to the story, they just feel trite. While they're key parts of modern society, it feels like they've all been forcefully thrown in for the sake of including them, or because it's ""cool"" to do so, not to actually benefit the film. They don't add anything to the story or the characters.I have no issue with real-life themes and character elements being represented in the things I watch if they feel natural and are key to the character/story, but when they are predictably all chucked in like they were here, it seems like forced, pointless box ticking.By the end of the film it felt like the writer was more interested in including those aspects rather than creating an engrossing story.There's no real suspense, the events are extremely predictable and the characters are lacking in depth. If you're looking for a horror, then you'll probably be disappointed as it felt like more of a drama with a few deaths tacked on.If you're looking for a horror, give it a miss. If you're looking for comedy, even dark, there's none to be found. If you're looking for a teen-themed drama with social commentary then you might enjoy it.2 stars for decent overall performance from the lead actress and a decent production value.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmQ2OTA1MzctZmE3Zi00ODRlLWE2YzQtYjRkNTY4NWQxOGJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjYwNjIyOTM@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This Is A Classic","The person who wrote the first review of this movie must be either a complete moron or has an acute lack of appreciation for what constitutes great moviemaking.""Brief Encounter"" is the perfect encapsulation of a very specific time in both women's and British history.  The immediate post-WW 2 era in the UK was a period that saw Brits struggling with the disppearance of traditional social mores that had endured for over a century and the new world order that came about at the conclusion of the war.  (For another, beautifully crafted cinematic example, see Neil Jordan's exquisite movie ""The End of the Affair."")Food rationing was still in place in postwar Britain.  Women were having to deal with getting to know their menfolk again, after their years of absence at war. Like their American ""Rosie the Riveter"" counterparts, British women had enjoyed newfound and unfamiliar independence during wartime, working for the war effort.  And, like their US ""sisters"", they were expected to relinquish those jobs to returning men.""Brief Encounter"" is, in many ways, a metaphor for the struggle that men and women were going through, stuck with having to conform to social expectations while bursting to escape to the greater independence glimpsed fleetingly and pleasurably during the war, when everything and everyone were turned upside down.Being the work of Noel Coward, that master observer of and commentator on English manners, ""Brief Encounter"" frames this struggle as a torrid love story bubbling under the surface of British reserve, which demands maintaining appearances at all costs, regardless of the personal pain involved.This passionate pair, who never even exchange a kiss, are constrained and ultimately kept apart by expectations--of their families, of their social positions, of Great Britain.When Alec puts his hand on Laura's shoulder at their final, unexpectedly truncated meeting in the station snack bar/waiting room, it's as erotic and far more touching than just about every sex scene you'll see in movies.The first reviewer completely missed the point and the relevance of this movie in film history and, especially, in British cinema history.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWQ0MGNjOTYtMWJlNi00YWMxLWFmMzktYjAyNTVkY2U1NWNhL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

They were remarkably consistent right up until the very unfortunate 'Ghost Dimension' which killed the series. Now, years later, we have another entry in the 'Paranormal Activity' series. The only problem is that it is a part of the series in name only. It has no connection to the previous films and it has nothing that demands it be a 'Paranormal Activity' movie. It could be any old found footage film - and not a very good one at that.The original series was so good because it was set in an ordinary looking house like yours or mine. And the thought of your partner spending hours through the night standing over you and staring was simply terrifying. A film set on an Amish farm isn't scary in any way, because who of us is ever going to go to one?A couple of things I did like. They were able to recreate the feel of the series in the first half of the film. It was actually building up quite nicely for a while there until it decided to go well off the rails at the end. The other thing I liked were the main three characters. They were very likeable and people I could get onside with.I feel like I'm mentioning it a lot in films lately, but it needs to be remembered that less is more. This film goes so hard and in your face that it can't possible be scary. What we don't see is always scarier than what we do. This film completely forgets that at the end.I so desperately wanted to like this movie, with the hope that it would reignite a series that I love. This wasn't the storyline to do it with though. This feels like a random found footage film that needed a selling point, and so chucked 'Paranormal Activity' in front of its title. Very disappointing. 5/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTI0YjQ1OWItZTI4NS00MDY4LWE1OWMtMWJlMjIzY2VkNDMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM1MTE1NDMx._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Little Death explores two stories that are tied together but the poor direction, HIGHLY unlikeable characters, poor performances and annoying writing creates an infuriating experience throughout watching this movie.Director Jack Begert seems to struggle on how to balance out the narrative and concepts together as the structure feels unfocused and many of the writing, dialogue and themes explored were pointless, unfunny and kind of full of itself. Many of the performances are honestly pretty bad. I like many of the cast members like David Schwimmer, Gaby Hoffmann and Talia Ryder. But unfortunately, their performances were messy and their characters are really unlikeable and aggravating in the worst way. Each character comes close to wanting to pull your hair out of your head levels.Begert approach on the humor is poor, the editing and musical choices are annoying, and the dialogue is forced, unfunny, and poorly constructed. There are some really awful visual presentations and animations throughout. To top it off, the animations were AI-generated which honestly is a major slap on the face for independent filmmakers and artists. It's insulting that Sundance allowed this movie to come into the festival.This entire movie really takes everything bad about movies and crammed together in one project.

If you want to get along, especially in a Northern English mining town in the 60's, do not ever hope for anything better.  If you do, the world's gonna come and kick you in the teeth.  Discuss.Billy Casper has an empty life.  In trouble with the police for theft, he shares a bed with his brother (a discontent miner willing to take out his frustrations on just about anyone nearby), goes to a school with some dispiriting and brutally repressive teachers, and has nothing to look forward to but the day when he to descends into Hades to work the coalface.Until Kes comes along.  Kes is a kestrel that Billy rears and trains.  Kes soars where Billy can only dream.  Kes is hope.Ken Loach is the master of social commentary and I think this is probably his best film.  This film embodies what it means to be working class in all the best traditional ways.  You work, you do not have ambition, you are surrounded by people who have accepted their lot in life, you cannot hope for better, you won't be allowed to hope for better.  If that sounds brutal, it is and so is this film.  You aren't told right and wrong, you are told what is.  It is thrust in your face for you to deal with.The best thing about this film are all the characters that surround Billy. All have had all spirit hammered out of them at an early age and are damned if any one else is going to have any.  The teachers casual and resigned brutality living what remains of their dreams by playing against the boys on the football field and imagining they are Bobby Charlton (and still losing) is perfectly displayed.  The shop keeper's humouring of childish enthusiasm because he knows it ain't going to last.  And most of all Billy's brother's spiteful depression.  His spirit has been freshly crushed and it still rankles.And amidst this gloom shines Billy and Kes.  They soar above this nightmare like Andy Dufrense soars when he plays opera to the Shawshank inmates.  Ken is telling us hope is a jewel to be treasured especially when it is surrounded by those wishing it crushed and buried.You must see this film, especially if you've seen the Shawshank Redemption. Be warned though, there is no redemption here.  Don't be afraid of the accents you non-Yorkshire folk.  Just think of it as Wallace and Gromit without the cheese.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMxNzM3ODktOWQwOC00NWU5LTgwYjctOWM2OTFmNGUxN2Y0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjgyNjk3MzE@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Set in the sixties, it is undeniably ""old school"" Ã¢ÂÂ a twisted tale of murder, treachery and double-dealing, based on the novel by Patricia Highsmith, where you half expect Alfred Hitchcock to appear in cameo at some point.Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings) and Kirsten Dunst (Spiderman) play Chester and Colette Macfarland a rich and affluent couple touring the sites and sounds of Europe, with us first catching up with them in a glorious looking Athens.Appearing to be relaxed and happy together, they hide a dark secret that is about to catch up with them. Oscar Isaac Ã¢ÂÂ so fabulous in Finding Llewyn Davis earlier this year, and about to hit mega-stardom in the Star Wars reboot Ã¢ÂÂ plays American rogue Rydal, who seems to stare intently at Chester. Is he part of the impending storm, or just an innocent caught up in events he can't control? Tensions rise, not just because of the plot pressures but also because of the obvious sexual tension growing between the charismatic Rydal and Chester's lovely and much younger wife.The compelling story Ã¢ÂÂ albeit somewhat predictable in places Ã¢ÂÂ takes in some fabulously atmospheric locations in Athens, Crete and Istanbul.This is the feature directorial debut of Iranian-born Hossein Amini, who also wrote the screenplay Ã¢ÂÂ this being his forte have written a range of films including Drive and Snow White and the Huntsman. And what a good job he does, orchestrating location, lighting and music to great effect. Some of the editing is also very tight, cutting away from scenes at crucial points to maintain the story's mystery.The trio of actors also bring great star power to their roles. Mortensen and Dunst are very watchable, but it is Isaac that again really shines in his role. In turns enchanting, brooding and cowed like a cornered animal, he plays the perfect James Stewart character in this Hitchcockian homage.In the coming blitzkrieg of summer blockbusters, here is a jewel of a film that will be particularly enjoyed by older viewers who remember when story and location were put far ahead of CGI-based special effects.(If you found this review helpful, please see my other reviews and 'Follow the Fad' at bobmann447.wordpress.com.

Potential sleeper hit.","If you are looking for a funny, touching, insightful, feel-good movie then Ten Inch Hero is for you. It's a story about four young friends and their older, hippie dude boss at a sub shop searching for love and learning to see past outer appearances and let go of preconceived notions.It's a deceptively simple movie. After all, we all learned in grade school not to judge a book by its cover, but maybe the simplest lessons need to be revisited every once in a while. Who among us can say we've never assumed something about a person from their outer appearance? Who hasn't felt like they didn't belong in a certain group or situation because they didn't fit the profile? It's no wonder many of Hollywood's young actors wanted roles in this movie. Hollywood can be one of the more superficial zip codes on the planet. A handsome actor gets a role because he is handsome, but is another role denied him because he is too good looking? Good looks are a two sided sword; they may get you in the door, but will your talent be recognized? Will you be relegated to the hunky hero roles or will you be allowed to create unique characters? That brings us to Priestly. Ah yes, Priestly! Priestly is unique, riotously funny, individualistic, sweet, witty and charismatic. Priestly rocks! He grabs the audience from his dynamic entrance and never lets go. He immediately starts spouting his sage opinions with witty humor and biting sarcasm and the audience is putty in his hands. Considering his look, with piercings, tattoos and multi-colored Mohawks, it must be the writing and Jensen Ackles' acting that sells this character. It certainly can't be Ackles' leading man looks; especially since most of the audience had no clue who he was.Halleluiah! Maybe now the PTB will recognize what a gifted and talented actor Ackles is. Jensen Ackles always puts underlying subtext in his roles. He is a very subtle actor who becomes his characters and Priestly is no exception. His fans appreciate him most from his portrayals of Alec on Dark Angel and his current role as Dean Winchester on the CW's Supernatural. He has the ability to take a seemingly straight forward character and find the depth in them and expose their fears and inner workings with a stark realism that blows you away.Priestly is a nice change of pace because he is allowed to embrace his comedic talent while portraying his most normal and well-adjusted character yet, despite the character's outward appearance. He takes a character most of the audience would avoid in real life and makes them care! Most of the audience would invite Priestly over to Sunday dinner by the end of the film. They loved him that much. It is refreshing to see a character whose looks appear so outside the norm be so content and happy.While Ackles may be the obvious standout, the entire cast is superb. This is an ensemble piece with every actor bringing a fresh outlook to their character and making us care about them. We laugh with them, we cry with them and, in the end we rejoice with them. You believe in this sandwich shop and the diverse people that inhabit it and you become involved in their lives.If you have ever attempted love or been to High School and lived within the confines of cliques, you can enjoy and empathize with these characters. The concept of outer appearances is examined in several different manners with every character discovering something new about themselves and the world around them. We all know not to judge others by looks, but how many of us realize our view of ourselves may not mesh with how the world perceives us? We may hold ourselves back just as much as we confine others.Ten Inch Hero is downright entertaining. First and foremost it is funny. Priestly is the comedic voice and the tampon scene will go down as a classic. The movie is beautifully photographed with peaceful scenes of the beach interspersed with the lives of the friends. The director, David Mackay, keeps the movie flowing at a comfortable pace, shifting back and forth between the characters' stories, but always holding your attention. There is no clock watching or restlessness, just an engrossing, satisfying movie.The script by first time screenwriter Betsy Morris is refreshingly realistic; it is not overly dramatic or contrived. Everything does not turn out as expected and there are three or four nice twists to offer a few surprises.Yes, it has a happy ending although everything does not turn out perfect. Living in these times with war and fear rampant, maybe we need a pleasant respite from daily life. Isn't that what the movies are supposed to do? Take us away from our lives? The funny thing about this movie is it stays with you. Once you are reminded of that grade school lesson, you start viewing the stranger you pass on the street a little differently. You look in the mirror and wonder if you are fulfilling your potential or if you are just staying in the preconceived box? This is a movie you will enjoy. I liked these characters and would love to hang out with them. I can't think of a better recommendation then that. If you get the chance, go see it. And if you are one of the PTB, get this movie into theaters and don't assume the target audience is under the age of thirty. All ages can feel a connection to these characters and everyone enjoys a great comedy. This movie delivers in all areas. If given the chance, with the young, talented cast of up and comers this could be a sleeper hit. It just needs a little help getting noticed. Once you get them in the theater, they'll leave happy.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NTk2NTY5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQ5MTYzMg@@._V1_UY209_CR6,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Christine (July) stalks the recently separated Richard (John Hawkes), who would try anything to impress his kids, and gets third degree burns for his trouble. His elder son, Peter (Miles Thompson) longs for connections that go beyond instant gratification, while the younger Robby (Brandon Ratcliff) gets all the funniest lines, mostly copied and pasted from cybersex chats.""Me and You"" is about the act of pretending and about performance as life, but first of all it's about extremely likable characters played by likable actors, foremost among them July herself, whose Carole Lombard-meets-Laurie Anderson deep ditz may be a complex stack of masks upon masks, but is more likely just the way she is.The movie is notable for what isn't in it - both malice and pain are almost absent. Removing malice - July's world is one in which a kid can safely walk alone through some seedy parts of Los Angeles - is unfashionable, brave and, given the gentle tone of the piece, necessary. But the absence of pain isn't intentional: July would like us to feel the loneliness of the characters. But their isolation is more a trait of their personalities than a source of suffering. In this respect, the movie is perhaps too glossy for its own good. There's one excellent exception, revolving around a granddaughter's photo by an elderly woman's bedside, which becomes a substitute for a shared life that dissolved too soon.The scene that everyone picks out is the walk to Tyrone Street. Richard and Christine decide the walk to the intersection will stand in for the relationship they're not having: first the unrelieved joy of being together, then the getting bored with each other, then the fighting and the split. Only they keep chatting flirtily, about whether the walk represents a year and a half or twenty, until they get to the corner, and then we wonder how they can possibly go their separate ways. Although this is as great as anything in the first 75 minutes of ""Before Sunset,"" its emphasis is much more on romantic comedy than the rest of the movie. There are more typical scenes that approach this quality. A goldfish on the roof of a car. A child running his fingers through a woman's hair. A picture of a bird in a tree, in a tree. And the ending, where it seems human actions are motivating the sunrise.The scene I consider the finest is a quiet one: Sylvie (Carlie Westerman), a tween spending her childhood preparing for life as a homemaker, gets a gift from Peter: a plush bird. (""It's for your daughter."") It would be unusual merely for depicting a platonic friendship between kids of different genders and different ages. But it's remarkable for crystallizing what it seems every filmmaker is trying to say these days: that there's something to be gained from thinking like a child. Through July's lens, it doesn't seem like a regression: no redundant literalization of fantasy is necessary. The achievement of ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" is to show how the mundane moments of our lives can be mundanely transformed by imagination.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0NTY1ODI4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzQ2OTc3._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's a movie which gets better and better with age. Director Robert Aldrich manages to put lots of style and interesting touches which sometimes border on the surreal into this toughest of tough guy movies. Ralph Meeker ('Paths Of Glory', 'The Dirty Dozen', 'The Anderson Tapes') is well cast as Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer. Meeker's Hammer is brutal and his performance really makes this one work. The supporting cast are all very good too, especially Albert Dekker ('The Wild Bunch') as Dr Soberin and Maxine Cooper as Hammer's ""assistant"" Velda. Also keep an eye out for the debut of Cloris Leachman is the striking opening sequence. The ""great whatsit"" which Hammer searches for is one of the great movie gimmicks, and the ending will blow you away - literally. I loved this movie from beginning to end. I think it ranks alongside 'Out Of The Past' (Tourneur), 'The Asphalt Jungle' (Huston), 'Double Indemnity' (Wilder), 'The Killing' (Kubrick) and 'The Killers (Siegel)' as one of the greatest and most influential American crime movies, and I'm sure Scorcese and Tarantino would be the first to agree.

But rest assured, this is a work of genius, exposing a deep understanding of the rift between genders during the height of the supposedly post-sexual-liberation 1980's, an almost sublime sense of humor about sexual alienation and most of all, the erotic link between women and cars in American culture is finally completely laid bare.In fact, this movie is so profoundly subversive that it could only be made under cover of shlock. Do not be fooled by what seems like coke-addled acting and tourette-syndrome editing. This film is high art. Especially the part where the robot says ""is that your hand?""

That's a heavy statement to make, but off the top of my head, I cannot think of another film that explores the inner workings of a character so intimately and believably, while blending cinematography, sound effects, and musical score in such harmony -- but in a fashion we (as American's at least) are not trained to enjoy. I felt the French influence strongly cinematically and, of course in the dialogue, but the writing and acting was so fluid it felt like the subtitles weren't even there. The film deals with a rare physical condition, and I was physically there with the character from start to finish. I felt each moment as if it were my own. That is a rare accomplishment in cinema. Julian Schnabel directed a stellar cast. Mathieu Amalric was unusually charming as Jean-Dominique Bauby, and Max Von Sydow was heartbreaking as his lonely widower father. The female leads were all equally impressive as they were beautiful. I don not mean to generalize them, but they were all so excellent that they blend seamlessly in my mind, in terms of performance.Overall, this film was as pure a cinematic experience as I've witnessed in a long time. A true artist turns out a film that is truly a piece of art. Julian Schnabel takes his time in between films, but with work like this, there's no need to rush. Like a good painting, one can enjoy it for a lifetime.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3MjkzMDkxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAyMTU1MQ@@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I highly recommend it for those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires.

I'm usually in agreement with the other voters; but the masses are way off on this one. Touchback is a great movie addressing themes that Hollywood doesn't advocate very often: Seeing purpose in your life, satisfaction with what you have, leaving regrets in the past, second chances, personal reflection, and a reminder that no matter how bleak things appear in a given moment, there are family, friends, and community who care about you.Yes, there are some cheesy spots, and a few instances of questionable acting, not to mention the high school students/athletes look over 30! But if you can get past the minor flaws, and look to the powerful themes in this movie you will not be disappointed. Touchback isn't epic (nor does it try to be), but it's certainly not a 5.7!

I rented it on DVD and watched the unrated version, and it was enough to make you think twice about eating anymore meat, it was pretty darn gory.

The only trouble is that the fine line that exists between the dummy and the ventriloquist becomes much too fine.  Anthony Hopkins is really good as this shy, awkward man slowly descending into a world of madness as great success looms over the horizon.  Hopkins also does the voice of the dummy, Fats, and lends his unique voice talents to create a very disturbing, eerie screen presence. The dummy is in many ways larger than life, and he steals almost every scene he is in.  No supernatural puppet coming to life here, yet the character of Corky(Hopkins) gives his life to this dummy in a very unique way.  The film is suitably creepy with some very atmospheric shots.  As one reviewer noted, the scene where Hopkins is to not speak through the dummy for five minutes is easily the best.  Each moment of that scene passed with incredible tension.  It is downright chilling in fact.  The other actors do very well. Burgess Meredith is made out to be much older that he was at the time, and I think he did a fantastic job.  What can I say about Ann-Margaret.  Stunning. She does a credible job acting, and let's face it, she looks like a million bucks(she even shows us more than expected as well).

I like it, and think it's pretty good -- for a spoof.","I'm not a huge fan of slapstick spoofs. I love ""Airplane!"" and the ""Naked Gun"" films, but it's not my favorite genre. Ironic, then, that I find most spoof movies enjoyable, at the very least, because they're all really, really stupid. There's more quality in ""Airplane!"" than, say, ""Hot Shots!"", but both films are enjoyable, because you have to do absolutely no thinking whatsoever. All you have to do is laugh a few times. And with the millions of jokes (okay, hundreds) per film, you're sure to find at least a handful of things worth laughing at.""National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1"" is one of my favorite spoof flicks. Why? It's stupid, silly, funny, and one of the most enjoyable films available to see. Yeah, it's stupid, like I already said. But it's loads of fun, too. And I don't care if critics bashed it when it came out -- it's still a very fun movie.Everything gets lampooned in this: ""Lethal Weapon"" to ""Die Hard"" to ""Silence of the Lambs"" to ""CHiPs."" And, alongside ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World""; ""Austin Powers in Goldmember""; and ""The Player,"" it has some of the most cameos/stars to date. Get this: Emilio Estevez, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Curry, Jon Lovitz, William Shatner, Denis Leary, Erik Estrada, Dr. Joyce Brothers, Bill Nunn, Kathy Ireland, Corey Feldman, J.T. Walsh, Paul Gleason, F. Murray Abraham, Bruce Willis, Phil Hartman (R.I.P.), Whoopi Goldberg, Charlie Sheen (Emilio's half-brother)...am I missing anyone? Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Joe Pesci would have completed this cast. I wonder if they rejected cameos.Wes Luger (Jackson) has been assigned a new partner, the loose canon Jack Colt (Estevez), who lost his dog long ago and is now mentally unstable. Luger lost his partner (Goldberg), too, and the effects of the past often catch up with him, so far that he finds it impossible to fire a gun without shaking violently and spastic-like.General Mortars (Shatner) is planning a devious scheme of running drugs through a Girl Scout cookie-type company, and Colt and Luger try to thwart his plan and save the day before it's too late. Meanwhile, they come to appreciate each other -- while lampooning everything in sight.The most puzzling thing about ""Loaded Weapon 1"" is the fact that, if you look at most user comments on the Internet Movie Database, they're all quite positive. It has a low standing at 5.3 stars, yes, but the user reviews for the film are pretty decent. A lot of people found the film ""funny for what it is."" I do, too.Spoofing a spoof is kinda pathetic, I'll admit. ""Lethal Weapon"" always was more tongue-in-cheek comedy than anything else. Even as a hard action film it was always winking at the other films of its genre. ""Wayne's World"" isn't exactly a drama of epic proportions, either, come to think of it. Even ""Basic Instinct"" is a hard film to spoof, if you take a moment to reflect -- it's never exactly horribly serious. Just sleazy. (I won't ruin how ""Loaded Weapon 1"" pokes fun at the famous Sharon Stone interrogation scene.)Yet, in my honest opinion, ""Loaded Weapon 1"" does a pretty darn good job of spoofing everything in sight. Estevez is a good Riggs-type who pines for his lost dog (not a wife, mind you, but a dog). Jackson -- who's usually great -- is decent as the Murtaugh-type character, although he is shoved aside by the screenplay to make room for Estevez. (Whose brother was just as good in ""Hot Shots!"", although I think this is a funnier film.) Lovitz, hair bleached (impersonating Joe Pesci from the ""Lethal Weapons""), comes across as an irritant sidekick who appears out of thin air only when the plot needs him -- which I suppose was the point. (Was ""Loaded Weapon 1"" assuming that Joe Pesci's Leo Getz character was an irritating co-star placed in the film as nothing more than an easy plot device? Probably.)And in one of the simplest -- but also one of the most effective -- scenes, we get the famous bathroom bomb sequence from ""Lethal Weapon 2"" told in an entirely fresh perspective. Here's how it goes: The door to Jackson's house is wide open. Estevez walks in and calls him. ""I'm up here!"" is the response. Estevez walks up the stairs, gets to the bathroom, opens the door, sees Jackson on the toilet and says, ""What are you doing?"" Safe to say, he's doing exactly what it looks like. His blunt reply is one of the highlights of the film. (Let's face it, that scene from ""LW2"" was destined to get poked fun at some time or another -- I'm just glad it got spoofed in this.)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWNhMWJjMmEtODIxNi00ODRhLTk1ZmEtYzhlYzIzYTkyMDE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

A drama can have comic relief, but that works only in the framework of the genre that's been established. Comedies can have their dramatic, emotional moments, but if they then turn into dramas, audiences are confused and disappointed. If a screenwriter and director can't even tell their story competently within the confines of the genre they first set up, their movie will fail. Yes, Stone is well acted. So what? Do you go to the movies to see good acting class exercises? If so, check this movie out. Norton and De Niro are entertaining, early on at least, and there's sharp dialog they have to work with (how else could they do their jobs? Don't you love people who praise the acting without acknowledging the script?)But the story Ã¢ÂÂ the real reason most of us venture out to see a film Ã¢ÂÂ in Stoner is a mess. The movie starts off essentially as a thriller. The plot sets up a con working a con, with his sexy wife, on a prison case officer. But after putting the movie is thriller mode the movie then tries to be a drama about the meaning of life and presence of God. The movie tries to turn its main plot with the wife into a subplot, and then pretend that fun, salacious venture wasn't really what the movie wanted to deal with. No, let's talk about the meaning of life.Stone, then, is a disappointment. Even as a drama it fails: the story dissipates into ambiguity with regard to the final action. POVs have jumped around all throughout the movie but in not showing us the final resolution between Stone and his wife, the whole fulcrum of the movie is left blank. As for the transformation of Stone Ã¢ÂÂ something Norton tries to act by occasionally calming his voice and widening his eyes Ã¢ÂÂ it's unbelievable, not fully formed or demonstrated and, like the rest of the movie, a pretentious attempt to take a fun dime-store novel's story and make it profound.Don't waste your time or money with this one. If you have to see it, wait for video. The movie is shot in TV-like close-ups for the most part and it will play just as well there.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxOTk4MDIyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI3Nzc3Mw@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It just inches along through a collection of scenes. And these scenes end up being incredibly repetitive. Not only do we see the characters doing a lot of the same things they were doing before, but a lot of information is repeated over and over. Scenes happen that give us no new information, or repeat what we learned from an earlier scene. It's not just that some scenes needed to be cut, the entire film needed to be restructured. As it stands right now, there's no connective tissue making this a cohesive film. It's just scene after scene.

BAD GRANDPA comes from the JACKASS team and while I did enjoy the show and the three previous films, all of them simply wore out their welcome after a while but that's certainly not the case with this film. I'm not going to go into great detail about the various pranks in the film because it's best to go in without knowing too many of them. I will say that this here doesn't resort to physical violence all that much, although there are a couple examples. The main focus is just this weird old man who puts his grandson into all sorts of bad situations and usually makes them worse. I think the film is remarkably funny and I'd probably call it one of the funniest films I've seen in a very long time. Again, I'm not a JACKASS die-hard but even if you hate that show you'll simply fall for the variety of dirty humor here. We get stuff dealing with the old man's sex life, his dead wife, various scenes of him playing drunk and causing trouble and of course there are some of the moments that everyone saw in the trailer like the beauty pageant. Why four stars? Why not? The film really is a laugh riot from the opening scene to the very last one and a lot of credit has to go to Knoxville and the various writers. What really makes this film work is a little ""story"" built around all the jokes about this grandfather coming closer to his grandson. It's oh-so-silly but that's the point. The various situations the two find themselves in are certainly the highlight of the picture as we get some downright shocking scenes. There are even moments that you'll see coming from a mile away but then you'll get a twist that will just have tears running down your face. BAD GRANDPA certainly earns its R-rating but it's also one of the funniest films in a very long time.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4NjIwMTI5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjU1MTMyMDE@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's cheesy and low-budget, unfolding like a stage-play ineptly filmed, with a script dulled by timid ideas and old-school misogyny. Yet in Patricia Laffan, the British actress who plays Nyah the Devil Girl, this picture presents a space-queen unrivaled in the annals of B-movie campiness. Her dominatrix boots and patent-leather cape, not to mention her highbrow imperious accent, easily outclass the features on display from those Venusian babes in Queen of Outer Space (1958) or the Martianettes in Flight to Mars (1951). And check out that Devil Girl headgear, a cross between medieval helmet and Egyptian sphinx! In silhouette, Nyah is the image of Darth Vader, striding about with cape swirling to do something unspeakably naughty. But before you conclude that Ms. Laffan's over-the-top performance is an instance of bad acting, consider this: there's no way to play a character like Nyah with psychological depth. The Devil Girl is a comic-book villainess, an icon, somebody who has to be bigger than big. Patricia Laffan is the perfect drama queen to meet the challenge. If you like her in this movie, be sure to see her in Quo Vadis? (1951), a glorious sword and sandal epic that also features the burning of Rome and the martyrdom of the Christians. In that film Laffan plays Poppaea, wicked Empress of Rome, opposite Peter Ustinov's even more formidable Emperor Nero. From bride of the Roman Antichrist to warrior-woman of Mars is just a small step -- or should I say, it's a small step for Patricia Laffan, but a giant leap for anyone else.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFkNzE2ZmMtNjc5OS00OWIxLTg0ZWYtZDUyYzJhZTNlZTU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzg1ODEwNQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Through the red haze of a Harlem morning, we are introduced to Flipper and his wife Drew in a very compromising position. Entangled in both the sheets and a moment of passion, the couple begin their morning in copulation, all the while trying desperately not to `wake the baby.' This `baby' could be a child who they've already produced or a child who is potentially in the making.This notion of sex as a means of producing children runs throughout the film. We find that even after Flipper has begun his relationship with Angela Tucci, he would never think of having children with her. Flipper's fear of having mixed (`octoon, quadroon, mulatto') children is very high. We learn that his wife is mixed herself. Her father is white and her mother is black. During the scene in her office, we get a glimpse of the kind of heartache that she has suffered from her skin color, a result of the intermingling of the two races of her parents. This sex-and-its-aftermath theme manifests itself in the dysfunctional parent/child(ren) relationships throughout the film. Angie is tied to her father and two brothers as a sort of domestic slave. Not only does she have to work hard in a distant part of town all day, but she also has to return home to cook for and clean up after her three male family members. She seems to receive no financial or emotional support for her efforts either. This becomes very clear when her father beats her up after learning of her relationship with Flipper. We see a similar relationship develop with Paulie and his father. His father's constant nagging about the number of each of the periodicals that he orders on a daily basis coupled with his lack of gratefulness for the meals that he cooks for him each day drive Paulie mad. Though Paulie's father isn't as physically abusive as Angela's father is, we see his proclivity toward violence we he forces his way into the bathroom and whaps a teary-eyed Paulie on the head with a magazine. Eventually, Paulie is able to stand up to his father, telling him `I'm not your f***ing wife; I'm your son.'The most powerful and destructive parent/child(ren) relationship that unfolds on the screen is that of Flipper's family, including his brother Gator and both of his parents. Lee's choice to introduce the reverend doctor and his wife as parents of Gator first necessarily colors our impression of them as good parents. What type of parents produce a crackhead? Certainly not the same type of parents that produce an upstanding architect, but maybe the type of parents who would rear an interracial adulterer. Other than Drew, who we really never see interact with her child, Gator's mother is the only mother to which we're physically exposed in the text. She loves both of her children and would rather not talk about the problems that exist in their relationships. Instead, she closes her eyes to the truth of Gator's drug habit and hands him money while he does the dances that she likes, and she would rather change the subject at the dinner table than broach the topic of adultery. This approach to parenting doesn't work any better than that of her counterpart. The reverend doctor doesn't ever want to really talk to his kids about their problems without using biblical metaphors. These one-sided diatribes seem to drown out any potential discussions just as much as the wailing of his favorite Mahalia Jackson records. In the end, he must kill his neglected son because he has deteriorated so extensively from crack use. The film's concluding sequence has brought us full circle. The framing of the newspaper landing on Flipper's stoop initially suggests that everything has returned to normal - that Drew has accepted her husband back into her life. Their daughter's smiles and giggles also point to the same conclusion. But we find, as Drew rolls over in bed and tells Flipper he better leave, that the sex is only a temporary fix for a desire for pleasure. The sex will not solve the problems that it has created. In the film's resolution, we see echoes of Paulie's father's former explosion in the bathroom: `All they think marriage is for is humping.'The final, seemingly confusing line of the film - `Yo, daddy, I'll suck your big black d*** for $2.' - sums up this theme well. It both mirrors in video and echoes in audio an almost identical part from earlier in the film. When Flipper was walking his daughter to school, a crack whore approaches him with the offer, `I'll suck your d*** for $5.' By the film's end, the price has lowered, the sex has been cheapened, and the whore is addressing Flipper as `daddy.' In this final line, the importance of parent/child relationships is emphatic. Sex, a supposedly physical manifestation of love, often results in a product - a child. This child will then live in a society where sex and love is misguided or undirected altogether.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5MTQxMDk2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQ2MDc3NjE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

What they must realize is that ""Samurai X"" was an OVA created for western audiences done by people who had no connection with the manga or the original anime and thus was a departure from the original intent and feel of what the creator of the manga had in mind. He even disagreed with how ""Samurai X"" ended regarding the fate of Kaoru and Kenshin, so much so that he insisted on having the proper ending he envisioned for his own characters put into a collector's box edition of the original anime released in Japan. Even though it was gorgeously rendered, it was overly depressing and moody. Whether you want to believe it or not, Kenshin really wasn't that way. The whole point of his redemption was that, in spite of the pain of his past, he was still able to appreciate the simple joys in life and even laugh at things. The Kenshin in ""Samurai X"" was a somber, overly-wrought, super-tortured fellow who was awash with his own suffering. As a fan of RK, seeing him portrayed that way in ""Samurai X"" really broke my heart because a huge chunk of his personality went missing and all that was left was this emo dude. Onto the review: PLOT/STORY: Understandably, this movie had a hard time trying to capture everything in the first volume of the manga in just over two hours. Because the manga was continuous, there was no way for the movie to be cut and dry in terms of villains and side characters. The director had to draw the line somewhere so the movie could have an ending. So, many fan favorite scenes were cut or changed in order to accommodate a more fluid movie. Time constraints didn't allow for a deep fleshing out of all the characters but, since this the first installment of other movies to come (it has been greenlit as a continuing series) I suspect that the audience is going to be exposed to that over time. I was taken aback at just how many things were changed (Sano's intro, Jin'e's concocted connection to Kanryu, Hanya's choice of weapons, the Oniwabanshu but no Aoshi?!) but I felt they did their best to stay true to the spirit of the story by trying to streamline events. There is even a flashback scene of Kenshin's past included in this movie but it gave you a hint (just a hint) of his tortured past and leaves you wondering.ACTORS: The casting was very well done for this movie. Kenshin is supposed to be relatively diminutive and almost feminine in his looks and stature (the creator based him on an actual historical figure who could carry out assassinations in broad daylight, he was that good), which is why people always underestimated him in a fight or commented on his slight figure. He was a Jekyll and Hyde that way. He could go from unassuming, humble Rurouni to out-and-out killer who's eyes would change into a murderous gaze when the ""hitokiri"" side was provoked (straight outta the manga). You could say Kenshin can ""hulk-out"" lol. Sato, with his pretty looks and physicality, really did well in portraying the conflicted character of Kenshin. Emy was cute as a button, perhaps too cute, since Kaoru is supposed to be a bit more plain and a tomboy but it was satisfying to see her bickering with Yahiko. The kid playing Yahiko was spot-on with the brashness and stubborn pride. Sanosuke's portrayal was a little goofy. There is no allusion to what drives Sano into being a fighter for hire but read the manga for clarification and you will see why he and Kenshin create such a strong bond of friendship. In the movie, there was no time to do so, I guess and Sano's a lot tougher than he is portrayed. Megumi's actress did her justice, I think. Again, not too deep in fleshing out her past either but still, you can see her intelligence and intensity underneath her manipulations. Lastly, Saitou's actor was awesome. He captured the cold, brutal carriage of the Wolf of Mibu very well with his stoic face and the constant badgering of Kenshin. I will stop at the main characters or else this will be too long. All in all, the casting was superb.MUSIC AND CINEMATOGRAPHY: The music ranges from fairly modern (techno beats with tribal vocals) to standard orchestral. I don't remember hearing any traditional Japanese instruments being played over scenes but I could be mistaken. Sometimes the music seemed to be out of place or over-used. For example, dramatic fight scenes seemed to bring out that techno song again and again). A part of me wishes they had somehow incorporated Kenshin's theme from the original anime series; just s simple wooden flute part or something as a nod since it's so recognizable. Otherwise it was fine. The look of the movie is fantastic. Whether it's a war-torn forest or just a village scene or a shot of Kaoru's dojo, it looks thick and substantial. I remember seeing shots of the creator of the manga (Nobuhiro Watsuki) on the set of the movie and watching over the set building. It gave me great comfort that he was there to see it through.Overall, this is one of the best, if not THE best, live-action adaptations of a manga I've yet seen. For those of you who are going to see it, if you haven't read the manga yet it certainly isn't required in order to enjoy the movie but it was thoroughly more enjoyable to see these beloved characters come to life on screen. In any case, I am greatly looking forward to the next installment and will relish in trying to figure out what storyline is going to be featured next!!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDgzODM2MjUyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg4MjA1OTE@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Right off the bat, the original film was unheard of and it's beyond clear that they just couldn't leave the idea alone. Deep Throat: Part II is, in short, miserable; a pointless exercise that even a devoted fan of the original could hate, as it trudges by in eighty-eight minutes, giving newfound respect to softcore films shown late on Cinemax that actually show something. I speak not as a person wanting to be pampered with intimate closeups of breasts and other body parts, but when a pornographic film feels so scared to show a simple breast on screen is where the line needs to be drawn.Deep Throat was, in short, a fun movie. It was funny when it needed to be, corny practically all the way through its runtime, and somewhat arousing, even as its scenarios and lines of dialog were blatantly asinine. Deep Throat: Part II is about as soulless as modern pornography and, frankly, feels more like making a regular film than a pornographic one. This is fine by me, any day, if the film (a) didn't borrow the name, actors, and strange humor from its predecessor and (b) didn't have such a lackluster, unfathomably uninteresting storyline.The film stars Linda Lovelace, once more, who, during Deep Throat, boldly exercised the rights of sexual freedom and women's choice. She plays herself again, working as a nurse for the sex doctor named Jayson (Harry Reems, who returns in a far less amusing role), with the goal to get all of her clients to have some sort of pleasure during sex that either never existed or was simply never recognized. Her latest man is a geek named Dilbert Lamb (Levi Richards), who is working intricately with the government to run a powerful computer that stores unprecedented amounts of confidential and personal data. In order to obtain the data, Linda must become romantically involved with Dilbert, leading to chaos and uncertainty with organizations like the CIA and the FBI that are heavily guarding the computer.It would appear that the plot got the best of Sarno (also the writer), as he seems to show more of an interest in finding out where a story like this could go rather than providing some levels of arousal, humor, or consistency in the story. I continue to run into the quandary of trying to grade Deep Throat: Part II as a piece of erotic filmmaking because not only is there nothing erotic about it but it doesn't even seem to want to be known as softcore film, despite its label, title, and actors.Even if I try to grade this as simply a B-movie with mild erotic undertones, I run into a complete lack of interest with its material and writing. The only thing more depressing than watching a bad movie is seeing clearly cheery actors succumb to the bad material on screen. After watching Lovelace and Reems bring incomprehensible hilarity and fun to the original Deep Throat, seeing them half-baked (which may not be just in terms of their performances) and lackadaisically going about their similar characters again with a Z-grade script is entirely disheartening.This is an uncompromisingly boring, horrifically inert softcore movie that makes you question and rethink calling it a ""softcore movie."" A softcore movie, by definition, contains scenes of sex that are shot with a sense of conservatism, being that they do not show all of the human body at work in bed. For as sex-obsessed as its predecessor was, Deep Throat: Part II shows no signs of compassion or interest in its subjects or the sex they could potentially be having. Even a scene of three characters getting dressed is burdened by an unnecessary speed-up in editing. If only the entire film could be burdened by that style of editing.Starring: Linda Lovelace, Harry Reems, and Levi Richards. Directed by: Joseph W. Sarno.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDk5ODQ4MGQtYzU4MS00NjIzLWI4OTMtMTYyOGIyMTg5OTYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzM4MjM0Nzg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The fact is, is that after Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedrin did battle with seagulls in 1963, Hitchcock never again approached the heights of a major director and he dramatically slowed down his film output.Still, this movie, along with 1964's ""Marnie"" and '72's ""Frenzy"" represent a decent effort by Hitchcock to stay current and hip with modern audiences. That he was still directing films at all in the 1960s and 1970s is quite remarkable for a man whose film work began in the silent era.""Family Plot"" is a fun, neat little comedy-thriller much akin to the NBC Mystery Movies of that era... i.e., ""Columbo"", ""McMillen and Wife"". Blanche is a phony psychic who, along with her reluctant boyfriend Frank, played hilariously by the underrated Bruce Dern, run afoul of big time crooks Karen Black and William Devane.The plot does get a bit convoluted, but Hitchcock was smart enough to lay off the heavy-handed dictatorial directorship that categorized his earlier work and let the actors and their characters move the plot along. Unlike Cary Grant's Thornhill in ""North By Northwest"", we care about Blanche and Frank because they really are like us, the viewer. As much as we all adored the women in Hitch's films... Grace Kelly, Tippi Hedren, Kim Novak, and wanted to be like the men,Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewert, Ray Milland, Rod Taylor, Farley Granger, etc., none of these characters were remotely like US, and in his dotage, Hitchcock was still keen enough to realize that Cary Grant in 1956 was an admirable figure walking down the street... in 1976 he was apt to be pointed at and laughed about. Hitch knew INSTINCTIVELY that the gray suit and slicked back hair era was gone forever. In this film, it doesn't even look like Dern showers.That's part of the charm and why it was so refreshing, at this late date, to go into the movie theater and enjoy an Alfred Hitchcock film without having to sigh that it was all about nostalgia. This film, in his humorous approach has much in common with ""The Trouble With Harry"" than ""Psycho"" or ""Shadow of a Doubt"". Hitch didn't go out with a classic, that's for sure, but he went out with a modern film that showed he could still produce an entertaining flick. That was all he was ever about anyway. No higher praise is needed.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWE5NDI0OTktNWZkZi00OTQ5LTg2ZTctNzljNDFmZmYyYWEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Jessica Biel plays the title character, a savvy sophisticated woman who was the love of Syd's (Chris Evans) life. Since she left him, he has become a complete wreck. He now spends his days drinking and snorting cocaine. Six months later, he finds out through a random phone call that London is moving to Los Angeles. The worst part is that her friend Becca (Isla Fisher) is throwing a going away party - one that he isn't invited to. Determined to get London back, Syd decides to crash the party along with his unsuspecting dealer Bateman (Jason Statham), a banker who sells drugs on the side. When they get there, they eventually wind up in the bathroom. They snort huge amounts of coke and talk about life and love as Syd attempts to get up his nerve and talk to London. Along the way we are introduced to a number of eccentric characters, such as feisty bartender Mallory (Joy Bryant) and high-school student Maya (Kelli Garner). Each one plays a part in Syd's tripped-out journey of self discovery.Although it features a cast full of popular young stars, London is not an easy sell in the slightest.. Audiences aren't likely to respond due to its strange and offbeat plot. It reminds me a lot of 1999's Go in this regard, although it is considerably less mainstream. It is truly a character study of many different individuals, all of them reflecting on life as the events unfold before their eyes. It moves at a slow pace but is never boring thanks to excellent performances and stylish direction.Chris Evans is on screen for almost every frame and delivers another excellent performance. He shows his dramatic chops here and exhibits an ability for both comedy and drama. His character is very complex and has many different layers, all of which are revealed throughout the course of the film. Jason Statham, well-known for his action roles, plays against type here as the straight laced businessman Bateman. He shows his talent in both comedy and drama, and also has great chemistry with Evans. Jessica Biel is radiant and fascinating as London, a woman longing for complete commitment in an otherwise stable relationship. She has strong chemistry with real-life boyfriend Evans and her character is believable and likable. Most of her scenes are flashback sequences, so it is interesting to watch her character progress.The supporting cast is great for a film of this size. Joy Bryant is solid as Mallory and gets the most to do of the side characters. Kelli Garner makes an impression but isn't given a whole lot to do, maybe appearing for fifteen minutes total. Isla Fisher, who was hilarious in last year's Wedding Crashers, gives another strong comedic performance here as the naive and unsuspecting party host. The rest of the actors are fairly insignificant overall, with most being reduced to mere walk-on roles (such as comedian Dane Cook).Richards writes and directs this project and shows great promise in his first outing. The direction is stylish and he finds many interesting takes to use - making the film easy to watch and helping it from dragging on. The screenplay is also solid. It seems like something originally written for the stage, but it works on film thanks to the way each scene is handled. While there are comedic elements, there are also several sweet and poignant scenes. The best scene in the film is the final confrontation between London and Syd in an airport. The Crystal Method provides the score for the film, a techno-fringed mixture of various beats that fits well with the tone of the film.Overall, I can see why London isn't appreciated by critics and won't be embraced by audiences. It's a strange film that requires patience from the viewer due to its slow pace. But thanks to excellent performances and stylish direction, it turns out to be a completely fascinating and involving tale.8/10 (B+)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MzQxNTU3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE2MzIzMQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Constantly undercutting Hollywood prices (because of the cheaper Loonie) has kept the cash flowing.And the Canucks have also taken hostage obscure sectors of the business that no one else was paying attention to. For example, 90% of all the so-called ""X-mas"" films you have seen in the last 20 years were Canadian-made.Finally, Canada is where most once-successful franchises go to die. When you see a horror franchise or action franchise on its very last legs -- think Freddy Kruger IX or something like that -- chances are it is Canadian made.So, against this odd backdrop of entrepreneurial spirit, it is rare and refreshing to see an auteur express a vision that is not a knockoff of something else.And that is the key. This film is an original, it is like nothing you have seen. It takes place in one of Canada's most picturesque (showcase) small towns but it is not a small town piece like Doc Martin or Gilmore Girls or even Corner Gas. It has elements of faith but it is not a ""faith-based"" movie. It has elements of a rom-com yet without the ""rom.""Again, an original.And it is technically perfect. The script is solid. The acting from the leads is excellent, especially the often-overlooked Jonathan Pryce. (Secondary characters are hit and miss, which unfortunately is the curse of Canadian film making.) The story holds the attention. The questions raised are interesting. In many ways the film revisits issues from the blockbuster hit Resurrection (1980) but in a much subtler way.It is solid workmanlike entertainment and deserves a better rating than most members have given it.Recommended.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDMwZTk1Y2UtNTM4YS00MmJhLThiNDAtMTJjYTdjYzg2YmNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkzODk2Mzc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I stumbled upon it by random luck, and given my love for all things horror, of course I took the time to sit down to watch ""Caveat"".Unfortunately this movie was brutally boring and slow paced. It was such a struggle to sit through the ordeal that was supposed to resemble a storyline. Especially since nothing worth of any kind really happened, and the movie felt more like a jumble of random scenes put together in semi-order to form a coherent movie.I was by no means entertained by what I saw here in ""Caveat"", and this is definitely not a movie I would recommend any horror fans rush out to get their hands on. To me, this movie was so insanely slow paced and uneventful that it simply wasn't worth wasting my time on. Yet, I endured about an hour or so, hoping that the movie would pick up in pace or at least the storyline would become more interesting. Neither of those things happened. And this is not a movie that I will ever be returning to attempt to watch the remaining part that I skipped on.The acting in the movie was pretty wooden and rigid, given the fact that the actors and actresses had next to nothing to work with in terms of script, storyline and well-written characters.""Caveat"" was a swing and a miss, and director Damian Mc Carthy just failed to entertain me with this 2020 movie.My rating of ""Caveat"" lands on a generous two out of ten stars.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGViZTAzZmItZWUwNC00MDkzLTg1MDItOTViZWUxMDllOWE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDA5MTY2Mg@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It is with that in mind, therefore, that I say Polanski is the best man for the job of adapting Ariel Dorfman's stage play; 'Death and the Maiden'. He proves this with the resulting movie, which is a thrill ride, combined with a character study all wrapped up in a layer of morbidity; needless to say, the film really hits home. Polanski handles this story, and his actors with the utmost precision and I have no qualms with labelling this movie as one of the man's masterpieces. I have no idea quite why it hasn't been better received, as although it's not up there with the likes of Knife in the Water, Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby; this is Polanski doing what Polanski does best, and when he's at his best; the man is brilliant. The story follows a chance encounter between a political lawyer and his neighbour, whom the man's wife is certain, is the same man who brutally beat and raped her while blindfolded under the reign of a fascist regime. What follows is a three-way character study between the victim, the man she thinks is her oppressor, and her husband; who is caught in the middle.The themes of truth and justice are rampant in this tale and as we watch to see if the villain of the piece really is the man who oversaw torture in the oppression, we are always reminded of the idea of the difference between a right and just punishment, and otherwise. As this is based on a stage play, it is the actors that are very much the star of the show. The three-pronged cast makes for a great ensemble, and every single one of them impresses. Sigourney Weaver gives determination and anger to her victim, and it is easy to believe that this woman really was tortured and beaten. Stuart Wilson is great also as the man caught in the middle of a horrible situation, but it is Ben Kingsley that provides the real standout performance. He manages to skilfully tread a line between an evil madman and a pathetic innocent victim brilliantly, and he ensures that at all times we are asking the question ""did he?"". Polanski's direction is superb, and the thing that most impressed me is the way that he firmly positions the tale in the middle of nowhere. This ensures no distraction, and makes sure that we are put firmly within our character's plight.On the whole, this is one of the best films that Polanski ever made. Considering his prowess as a filmmaker; that is really saying something and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this film to anyone who enjoys movies.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTgzZTcwNDItYjhhMy00NmViLWFjZjEtZGQ5YWQxYzk0OWU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjgxMzgyNjI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I recently discovered the importance of editing; it's good that this one was edited at a very quick and entertaining pace, otherwise it would've seemed outdated by today. I actually think a film like this would make it today, since there's a heavy backlash from the '90's 'political correctness' theme. There are some heavy themes here, (although it's a comedy) but C.Thomas Howell keeps you wanting more.

The fact that this dialogue was ad-libbed says a lot about the gonzo film-making that produced C.H.U.D.Story writer Shep Abbott came up with the word, ""CHUD"" during a party with actors Stern and Heard. The trio then brainstormed a movie idea around the word, Abbott wrote up an extreeemely rough draft (he'd never written a screenplay before), and it ended up on the slush pile of producer Andrew Bonime.Bonime tried to get Abbott to polish the script, but was never satisfied with the rewrites (partially due to Abbott's inexperience), and took the screenplay away from Abbott, giving it to writer Parnell Hall.Bonime had picked up the project partially because Abbott could get Daniel Stern and John Heard to star. (Heard and Stern have worked together in a number of movies over the years, including 'Home Alone I & II' and 'The Milagro Beanfield War'.)The two actors agreed to work for scale plus a percentage of the profits, but insisted that Christoper Curry be hired to play the part of Police Detective Bosch, and that Douglas Cheek be hired as director. This didn't sit well with Bonime, but he agreed and the movie was produced.Stern and Heard were not happy with what had been done to their friend's original script, and did their own page re-writes and ad-libs, which director Cheek left in the final cut. Bonime insisted that a shower scene with actress Kim Griest be written in, which Stern, Heard, and Cheek still complain about, 17 years later, on the DVD's audio commentary.However, the unedited version of the shower scene (with Griest's body double) appears as an easter egg on the DVD. (From the main menu, click on Extras. At the top of the Extras menu is 'Trailer'. Click the Up button on your remote, and the eyes of the C.H.U.D. in the background will be highlighted. Click Enter, and the 'Unabridged Scene' will play.)Despite, or perhaps because of, the civil war on the set, C.H.U.D. is a pretty decent horror relic from the 80's. Watch the movie first, then listen to Stern, Heard, Curry, Cheek, and Abbott do a hilarious commentary track. Stern boos and hisses when Parnell Hall's name comes on the screen. You'll find out that most of the cast are wives, sisters, or good friends with Stern and Heard. You'll learn how they wanted the monsters to look, and much more. And they really have fond, funny memories of the film, despite all the turmoil.As a counterpoint to their comments, producer Andrew Bonime set up a website, telling his own side of the story.Don't miss sitcom stars John Goodman and Jay Thomas in bit parts as extremely unlucky cops, during the movie's last half hour. This scene was placed at the end of the movie during its theatrical release, but has been moved to its correct sequence for the DVD.I rate the movie, 'C.H.U.D.' a 6; with the commentary track running, it's easily an 8 or 9. Best cut-ups since the MST3K 'bots.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzVlODkxY2YtNTliMC00MmQwLTkzNmQtYzM5ZGNiZDlmNTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I was without a doubt super excited for Krampus for two reasons. Firstly it's a horror film that isn't from Blumhouse, honestly with every horror film these days being ""from the producers of Paranormal activity, Insidious and The Purge"" I was starting to think Jason Blum made a pact with the devil to produce all mainstream horror films. Secondly this was the kind of film I hadn't seen in ages, something along the lines of Gremlins but more horror focused was what I've been wanting for a long time. So after seeing Krampus I was not disappointed at all. Was it a horror masterpiece on par with The Exorcist? No it wasn't but thats not at all what I wanted. I wanted a fun imaginative horror film and one that finally does justice to the long overlooked legend of Krampus. The idea of a Christmas horror film is nothing new but all the well known ones (Black Christmas, Silent Night Deadly Night) are always slasher films with human villains when Christmas had it's own traditional villain with Krampus why has it taken so long to bring him to the big screen?But anyway Krampus is unlike any film i've really seen before it's both lighthearted and funny but also surprisingly horrifying. I mean it when I say there's some nightmare fuel in this film even if i didn't find it that scary It is still in my opinion a legitimate horror. The Visit proved to me that horror and comedy can mix well. When a horror film is 100% serious thats OK as long as it's warranted. When a horror film takes itself too seriously though it can make it a boring watch. A great comparison is A Nightmare On Elm Street from 1984 and it's remake in 2010 the remake was largely panned because it was too serious while dealing with some ridiculous subject matter whereas the original made it into some morbid humour which worked much better. Krampus does the same although it is obviously more of a comedy than Elm Street. Krampus himself looks fantastic being made entirely of practical effects and carries a great presence in may opinion he is a classic horror villain in the making. Of course he isn't alone and is accompanied by demonic toys and wicked elves who's sadistic and playful nature makes for some truly horrifying visuals. Oddly enough though this is still a Christmas movie and does manage to bring me those warm holiday feelings. I think this film in it's own right will hold a special place in my heart as a holiday movie with a wickedly twisted side that I just loved so much. In conclusion Krampus won't win Oscars but I think if you go in wanting to have fun and experience some scares along the way you'll be more than satisfied. Krampus is one hell of a Christmas gift.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk0MjMzMTI3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEyODkxNzE@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

What little dialog existed was pretty decent, but there was just not enough substance in the film to convey much of anything. The first 25 minutes or so had around 30 words spoken, the rest was nothing but hardcore sex bordering on pornography. I am very baffled at the high reviews this is getting.

In a word, realism. In many words, the desire to capture life's most important, daring, fanciful, yet haphazard moments with the faith that by doing so you are illustrating a timeless notion. Cleo from 5 to 7 plucks a single string from a singer's life and by pulling at it, illustrates the fabric of the beautiful and unique, but predetermined world that it is woven into. What illustrates this best is the third scene of the movie when the heroine flits about a local shop browsing hats. The camera shows her shopping but also captures many reflections that expose the larger world around her. The window pane showcases soldiers marching by, foreshadowing the war in Algiers. The mirrors take snapshots of Cleo with different head-dresses all be-speaking a future she won't choose. In the background, her maid sits disapprovingly. Small details like these, that are often neglected in other movies, are the backbone of this work of art. Cleo from 5 to 7 is a movie about much more than two hours in the lead character's life. It is about the character's whole life as illustrated by two hours. Like Joyce's Uylsses, it finds parallels between the struggles of a day with the struggles of a life.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmUxMmY3YTAtMmQ4Ni00Y2ZkLWE4NTEtYjM5OGI0M2NlNzcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MTM5NjI2._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

All right, I've kept this secret, but I actually sat in on a production meeting for Anacondas and here's how it went down:""Annoying black dude who just screams the whole time?""""Check. But let's put a tough black dude in there as well. Don't wanna be accused of stereotyping.""""Good idea. Who is Morris Chestnut?""""Well, we thought it was a brand of chewing tobacco, but he's actually who we're gonna use as our tough black guy.""""Oh, OK. How about a Latino woman with an unnecessarily bad attitude?""""You mean the J-Lo wannabe? Check.""""Good. Did y'all find that tough-looking Asian guy?""""Check. It wasn't easy, but we found one with a mullet.""""Perfect. That'll alert everybody that he's not one of those brainy Asians. How about a blonde babe with a thick, fake Southern accent?""""Check. She's from Georgia, but her accent sounded too realistic. We told her to fake it up.""""Good job. And I saw that you found a white European male, but how about the protagonist?""""Oh, you mean the muscular white guy with a 2-day beard growth and husky voice? Check. He's in wardrobe right now having the sleeves on his tight shirt rolled up.""""Perfect. Just don't forget the tattoos. Now how about somebody who's actually famous?""""Um, well, we don't exactly have that. But hey, we've got everything else!"" And that, my friends, is your cast. Some other guy of some sort of foreign descent was thrown in there as well. He looked like Gregg Rainwater from The Young Riders. He died soon enough, so it doesn't really matter.My money says you really won't care about anybody involved in this production. Well, I did like the southern girl. She was pretty hot. But why do producers insist on accents being so fake? Her accent dwindled as the movie went along. She eventually was only accenting about one word per sentence, but by the climax she started fakin' it up with reckless abandon!And I'm sure plenty of girls will think Johnny ""Five O'Clock Shadow"" Messner is pretty hot, but for the most part you'll spend the first 10 minutes of the movie picking which characters you want to see swallowed whole by a giant anaconda. My first choice was the Jennifer Lopez wannabe. When B-movie characters like her prance around with a huge chip on their shoulder, I usually pray for some sort of creature to sneak up and bite that chip right off. Along with the entire shoulder.This is one of those movies that relies on every clichÃÂ© in the B-movie book. In other words, you can expect a whole lot of stuff like a door opening slowly and then something jumping out while a loud noise is made. And since this is a ""creature feature,"" by definition a lot of the action takes place at night, in dark caves and in water, with only flashlights to light the way.Dialogue is expectedly bad. We're treated to such intellectually-challenged exchanges as: ""What's wrong with this picture?"" ""You're in it."" And it's mostly dominated by Messner's Michael ParÃÂ©-esque line delivery and Eugene Byrd's banshee-like screeching. It's funny up to a point, but eventually you start looking at your watch and thinking, ""OK snake, it's time to eat this kid.""The CGI looks a little goofy at times, but most of it is well done thanks to the wise decision to hide the flaws with darkness and water. If you're wondering how this compares to the original Anaconda, well, the two really have nothing to do with each other except for presence of an anaconda. The first movie had famous people in it, this one doesn't. However, this one does have more anacondas! It's been 7 years since I saw the original, but I'm pretty sure it's the better of the two.My biggest complaint is that Anacondas wasn't cheesy ENOUGH! If you're gonna be bad, then go as far out on the cheesy limb as you can go! Instead of a blood orchid, their research should've discovered a rare, Indonesian banana that held the secret to long life. Then once it was discovered the anacondas were eating these things and living forever, one of the bad actors could've deadpanned, ""What are these things? Bananacondas?"" BWAHAHAHAHA! Man, I really need to start writing screenplays for intentionally bad movies.And I've said this before, but I'll say it again. Since ""versus"" movies are the current sequel trend, they should've dug up Harrison Ford (it's been four years since the guy had a hit), given him the Jack Ryan moniker again, and given *us* Jack Ryan Vs. Anaconda: The Hunt for the Blood Red Orchid in October. He could've been the guide for the scientists, and when one of them started whining he could've cracked, ""Traveling through Borneo ain't like dusting crops, boy."" Then he would've looked into the camera and winked. It'd have been awesome and you know it.Oh, and let me leave with a word of advice. If a bad guy is standing near the edge of an anaconda pit, and he's holding a gun on one of your colleagues, but his back is to you, then please, for the love of all that is holy, instead of whimpering like someone forced to sit through a post-1987 Corey Feldman movie, stand up and kick the guy in the pit.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc5MDg1NTkxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTcyNjA3._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This cast for years have entertained me through splendid movies such as Selena, Out of Sight, The Way We Were, and Million Dollar Baby. Although very aware of the skepticiscm of having La Lopez in a film with Oscar performing co-stars, would prove to show ones stubbornness. Lopez gives a knockout performance and I would challenge anyone who says she was miscast for this role. Isn't it the job of the actor to travel outside of their character, and convey the feelings of another. I don't think much is needed to be said about Redford's and Morgan's heartbreaking performances. Lasse Halstrom has outdone himself again, he has brought justice to the splendid novel by Mark Spragg.

Immediately a few people got up and walked out. Ten minutes in a couple more joined them. Others waited an hour, then popped off. Some of these people - though not necessarily in the same screening as me - have added their 1-star review to IMDb. These people should have their Unlimited cards confiscated and be barred from cinemas and writing reviews permanently. Sure, it's not a perfect film - Springsteen is shoehorned in a cringeworthy number of times and the narrative has a paint-by-numbers feel to it - but it's a cheerful film with a good message: do what makes you happy and don't be a douche. Those giving the 1-star reviews really did miss the second part of the message. Look, it's an ok film. If you like Bend It Like Beckham, you'll probably enjoy this. Of you're a massive 'The Boss' fan, you'll probably enjoy this. Don't trust the 1-star reviews; it's never a 1-star film.

I was never very taken with Beavis and Butthead's short sketches on MTV, and in truth they've never really taken off in England the same way they did in the States. The somewhat obvious satire lacks the gentle wit of Mike Judge's other creation, ""King of the Hill"", and spending 80 minutes in their company was a dubious prospect.However, ...Do America sensibly opens out the scope, taking in less broad targets. For a start, we have Beavis and Butthead's hippie teacher, who gently strums his spiritual song, ""Lesbian Seagull"". It's a testament to the profile of the cartoon that Englebert Humperdinck gives his own rendition of this for the end titles. But best of all is their neighbour, redneck Tom Anderson (Catchphrase: ""I'd love to get my hands on those two b******s for whacking off in my camper van""), who, while not the same character, has the exact same voice, personality and appearance of Hank from ""Hill"". Judge obviously knew when he was on to a good thing and built a series around this great character.The plot is brilliantly silly, with the two boys getting involved, unwittingly, in a plot that sees a killer virus, attempted murder and the emergence of World War III. President Clinton even makes an appearance towards the end. Movie culture is openly lambasted, starting with King Kong, and taking in an opening title sequence (theme song by Isaac Hayes, a year before South Park) that parodies both Shaft and Charlie's Angels. Look out too for the climatic ""slow motion"" sequence.Jokes are puerile, such as the two obnoxious leads laughing uncontrollably at the word ""wood"", or another scene where a man asks the pair ""have you got a match?"" ""Yeah,"" replies Butthead, the slightly smarter of the two, ""my butt and ... uh ... your butt"". It's childish, but it made me laugh. Not the most subtle exercise in wit, the film is still a worthwhile, and, by it's own small ambitions, successful picture.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWY3NmNlYzYtNzY5Yy00Y2Q1LWE1NWEtYzQ2NDM4YTMyYjVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The man who took my money was a Mexican emigre, and he saw that I was carrying a copy of the book Like Water for Chocolate by Laura Esquivel.  He asked how I liked it, and I told him I was loving it.  He told me not to miss the movie.""Oh,"" I answered, ""but I always worry that the movie will never be as good as the book.""""It doesn't matter,"" he told me.  ""This is a very great film.  And it is the first real Mexican film I have ever seen shown in this country.  You know, to everybody, not just the Mexican community.""I smiled and told him I would check it out, but honestly, I had no idea what he was talking about.  After all, I knew who Dolores Del Rio and Cantinflas were, and the movies with them that I had seen were shown in L.A., to everybody.But now, at last, I have seen this movie, and now, at last, I know what this guy was talking about.  Like, wow!  This really is a real Mexican film! Art! Cinema! More than just a bit of popular fluff!  Tender, compassionate and very witty, like the book on which it is based, this movie celebrates Mexican culture -- not just on the food, the preparation of which forms the premise of the story, but as kind of a rollicking take on the history of the young country at the turn of the century.  It celebrates the music, the style of life on a ranch, the strength of the extended family, the beauty of the land, and the ethnic mixing pot that is every Mexican.  There is so much reckless joy and passionate love in this film, even when it portrays pain.  It openly depicts female eroticism.  (Plus, for a big change from US cinema, we get to see beautiful men and women of many shapes, sizes and colors all on the same screen.)  The acting is flawless, and the star, Lumi Cavazos, is absolutely charming, full of life and credibility.The only flaws I found in this film were minor and had to do with timing. For example, the final ascent to the climax seems to have been shortchanged a little bit.  I would have liked to reach through this scene a little more slowly.To judge Mexican cinema by the type of films I had seen before this one would be like judging U.S. cinema on the basis of Jerry Lewis or some cheesy melodramas from the '40s and '50s, but not taking into account any of our real film art.

MacBride coming off the coattails from his debut The Conspiracy, has pitched other projects in Hollywood that were unfortunately stagnated due to the cursed development hell for many years. His most notable one being Echo that was a script he wrote which was planned to have George Clooney direct at a point. Leads us to our offering today; which according to an account from Christopher on a recent podcast interview he fought tooth and nail to get made. And it wasn't until Dylan O'Brien and Maika Monroe got involved that the ball really got rolling for the project to actually leave the development phase into legitimate production. Which other myriad of problems and bad luck occurred when filming started. Good lord.I only bring all this baggage up to legitimize the long known theory that a piece of aptitude does not always mirror its making. Never been more true with Fredrick Fitzell. A scrupulously well discerned and uncompromising work that is at every second idiosyncratic, poignant, visceral, and just plain bonkers but in the best ways thats apparent you're experiencing something truly special.Dylan O'Brien gives easily the best performance of the year that I've seen, at that one scene the guy isn't even acting; it's just him. I knew this kid had the chops and as Fredrick he more than proves his stripes for the string of other potential roles he could play.Have no idea what kind of home this movie will receive but it best be a just one.

He's probably best known for his commercial success with the 48 Hrs films, and his other brilliant features get criminally overlooked. He scored a cult hit with ""The Warriors"", he delivered one of the best westerns ever with ""The Long Riders"", and put all other car chase movies to shame with the ultra cool ""The Driver."" As anyone who has seen these films should realise, Hill should be mentioned in the same breath as Peckinpah, Woo and Rodriguez when it comes to slow-mo gunplay.""Last Man Standing"" doesn't rival these earlier works, but it is a tough, gritty film with some fantastic shootouts. It doesn't hold itself back in terms of blood and violence, something current US films of the genre are guilty of doing. It has everything an action film needs; tough antihero, loath able bad guys, a creepy main villain and plenty of cannon fodder. As long as you don't get hung up on technicalities (ie the guns fire ten times more ammo than they hold) you should be entertained.It doesn't feel like any effort went into the screenplay, but Hill adds some nice touches to the film in terms of nods towards the source material. I particularly like the opening where Bruce spins his empty whisky bottle on the ground to decide which road to take; a clear reference to Toshiro Mifune throwing a stick into the air to decide on his path. There is also an interesting cast; there's earlier Hill collaborator Bruce Dern (The memorable villain from The Driver), William Sanderson (Blade Runner) and of course Christopher Walken, who chews the scenery talking tough with his hoarse accent and threatening people with a Tommy gun. His performance is really the most memorable thing about the film. Willis is not Mifune or Eastwood, but he does suit the mysterious drifter character well and this is one of his better action man roles.All things said, the film certainly doesn't come close to ""Yojimbo"", but it does give the more rough hewn ""Fistful of Dollars"" a run for its money. By no means a masterpiece, ""Last Man Standing"" should still provide enough for any action fans tired of watered down mainstream Hollywood nonsense that currently dilutes cinemas. It is certainly a lot better than its reputation makes out.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTVjNTFjMmItN2QxNS00M2RkLWJkNWEtMzU4ZDc0ZjU1ZjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Yes, there is a religious context to the movie. A partner in a healthy marriage, we are shown, struggles to emulate the selfless love and service of Jesus by loving and serving his or her spouse, as Jesus would.

After seeing it, surely you will leave the movie theater thoughtful, impressed and full of pessimism. A movie that makes you think about loneliness in the big urban areas. A story that may be happening outside your house, while you live a comfortable life inside. It is a lonely world that belongs to the night, to the shadows, making part of the underground of the big cities. Once belonging to this world, it seems that its habitants are deteriorated into indigent human beings, who lose their names, homes and origins.The movie tells the story of Sergio who works at night as a garbage collector on a big city. He lives alone with his dog - and that introduces you into a universe where man and animal live under merged boundary conditions. Sergio is a lonely guy. Homosexual, he keeps himself away from a female job colleague who is always flirting with him. He has no lover, family or friends. But he seems to be always in the company of an enormous desire, which will conflict with his own loneliness.Loneliness and desire summarise Sergio's reality and push him into a primitive world, where man becomes animal. The protagonist tries to consume his strong sexual desire through anonymous, casual and wild sex. Thus, it is on the dark corners, public toilets and other filthy places where Sergio tries to satisfy his sexual impulse. But the promiscuity of those moments does not appear to satisfy him, since his desire leads him to the figure of an attractive swimmer guy. A guy who lives in one of the districts that Sergio runs into his night shifts, during his journey of work and garbage. That hard and solitary reality makes desire becomes obsession. Apparently, a single motivation only exists: search the young guy, peeping, observing him from distance and getting touch with an opposite environment.But Sergio seems to be conducted to an unavoidable end: a curious reversal process of the Human evolution. From human being, he seems to revert through a trail that takes him to some animal condition. As if loneliness and desire would lead to the most primitive stage of mankind. The anti-evolution process transforms him in an irrational creature: he eats, drinks, urinates and evacuates as an animal.

It is equally puzzling and disturbing and will leave you thinking about it for a long time to come.The story takes place at a military base in the American South during the last full year of the Second World War, in 1944.  Sergeant Vernon Waters, a Black man, is shot to death.  The locals, as well as the Black enlisted men at the base, believe it to be the work of the Ku Klux Klan.  Captain Davenport, also a Black man, as well as the first Black officer most of the men at this base have ever seen, is asked to investigate this.  The White officers all want to see this matter brought to a swift and tidy conclusion in order to prevent what they see as a potential race riot between the Black soldiers and local Whites around town.Davenport (deftly played by the late Howard E. Rollins Jr.) questions the enlisted men at the base, and begins to learn that the murdered sergeant(Adolph Ceaser in an Oscar-nominated performance) had no shortage of enemies, White and Black.Through a series of flashbacks, we learn that Waters is a man of great personal pride and dignity, a man who believes that the African-American race has great potential to ""take it's rightful place in history"" alongside the White race in America.  But his pride is also fueled by a terrible hatred of Black men, mostly Southern men, who he believes are hurting the race by presenting themselves as lower-class bumpkins; the stereotypical shiftless, lazy, ignorant types; the smiling, singing clowns; the ""yassah-boss niggers.""One soldier, C.J. Memphis, a simple but charming, illiterate, guitar-strumming man, comes to personify these character traits in Waters' eyes.  The clash between those two personalities is a crucial centerpiece to this movie's message.Ceaser is astonishing as Waters, a man so full of loathing and bile towards his own people, you can feel it oozing off the screen.  His best moment occurs in a bar where he stares into a mirror and talks in a dark tone about his unit's heroic efforts in France in the First World War, and how one Black soldier destroyed that sterling image in the minds of many White Frenchmen.....and what Waters did in response.  It's chilling.An undervalued film that you may have to look a little harder in your local video store to find, but well worth the effort!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTc2NDYwZmQtNzg3Mi00ZWQwLThiYjItNzlkZTFlZTlmMjFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It was clear though that the rot had set in as early as the late 70's with films like ""Play Motel"" or this one where the sex and nudity that had always been used to season the genre seemed to become its very reason for being. The only thing that separates a film like this from crappy American softcore porn is its almost cheerful political incorrectness, appalling lapses of taste, and a general paucity of silicone breast implants.Two sisters with a disturbed past check into a seaside hotel where the guests are suddenly being offed by a killer wielding a most unusual murder weapon, a giant dildo! (Amazingly, this was the second Italian film of 1978, after ""Red Rings of Fear"", to feature the ""death-by-dildo"" device). I won't spoil the ending by giving away the identity of the killer, but it pretty much spoils itself within the first ten minutes. This one fails utterly as a giallo (or a real movie for that matter), but I guess it kind of succeeds on the level of softcore pornography--the photography is good, the scenery is pretty, and the score is decent. The actresses are also all pretty attractive, especially the one who plays the lounge singer ""Stella Shining"" (although I don't know that most guys would want to bury their entire face in her backside like one Italian lothario very graphically does here).I'd recommend this perhaps for giallo completists (and maybe serious porn addicts), but for everyone else. . .uh, probably not.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzVlOWFkZjItYTg0Yi00M2M2LTk2MDItMWIwMzM1OTBkMGJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA0MzYwMDY@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I think perhaps Ingmar Bergman is right about Moodyson. He is a young master. Though I have yet see Moodyson's other films, I was overwhelmed by the power of this film.The film is about a group of counterculture types who live in a collective household called ""Together"" in 1975 Stockholm, Sweden. But they often struggle to get along because they have trouble finding and living with shared values and in some cases just don't like each other. Goran, the de facto head of the household, wants to please everyone. He wishes everyone would just get along. Any obstacle to group harmony is any obstacle to him as well. Elisabeth, the working class sister of Goran, one day is forced to move in to the household with her two children, Eva and Stefan, due to the breakdown of her marriage. Meanwhile, Rolf, her hard-drinking, abusive husband, struggles to overcome his devastation and loneliness over their leaving. Moreover, a boy who lives in a ""proper"" middle-class home next door to ""Together"" becomes attracted to Eva. This is the setup of a simple story with complex interactions. The story unfolds simply too, but in ways you don't expect because it is so unforced and natural. Like most great works of art, literature or filmmaking, it progresses and unfolds with a feeling of simplicity -- organic and lifelike.Don't be fooled by the specifics on the surface. On the surface this film seems to be little more than a survey of the amusing antics of hippies from the 1970s. But this film is so much more than that for many reasons. First of all, this film is a commentary on the adults of today as much as it is of the adults 1975. The reason I say this is because the emotional center of the story is with the two children of Elisabeth and Rolf: Eva and Stefan. By allowing us, the audience, to see most of the action through the eyes of two impressionable children suffering through the break-up of their parents' marriage in 1975, and struggling to adjust to their new environment of a collective, it soon becomes clear that this film is about us -- the children of the 1970s -- who are now in their late 20s up through the early 40s. The film is a look back through the eyes of a then child, now adult director of a time where nearly every value held by middle-class, western society and culture was challenged if not, in some settings, entirely uprooted. We are the children who grew up in this age of fantastic turmoil and upheaval -- which in Europe by the mid 1970s was probably even more tumultuous and radicalized than in the U.S. But of course it is also about the older generations who were young adults when all of this was happening. Perhaps most importantly, however, it is for the younger generations who weren't even born at that time. I say this because the direction the world seems to be headed for today seems to demand a response of a sense of some type community that began to disappear in the late 70s and 1980s. Many kids and young people only know about a couple kinds of communities and families: gangs and step-families. A film like this provides a very modest hope, but at least some kind of hope.The main characters who are children, Evan and Stefan, are looking for love, security and comfort at home, as all children do, but really can't find any of it save love, because the security and comfort of bourgeois, middle-class life was under this continual assault during the time period in which the film is set -- and continues to be assaulted to this day (though today often for different reasons). But meanwhile, next door, another child (I can't remember the character's name) must undergo a struggle of a different kind. He must endure the hypocrisy of his parents' loveless marriage, which carries on possibly out of habit, or possibly for the sake of appearances, or possibly a fear of loneliness -- or possibly all of these. The boy next door is aware and intrigued by the energy and liveliness of his strange next door, hippie neighbors, but he is mainly drawn to Eva, who is as much a misfit in her environment as he is alienated in his.If Eva's struggle is to find a new identity away from the failure of her parents' marriage, her brother Stefan's is to find a new way to reconnect to his mother and his father -- especially his mother, Elisabeth. She is now free to live again away from her hard drinking, abusive husband; but this new experimentation with a new life is, at least initially, a threat to Stefan, who early on fears that his mother may be on the verge of abandoning him, and his sister whom he is not very close with, for this new lifestyle. Moodyson has a remarkable talent of rendering characters who on are the verge of losing everything -- who are suffering devastating ruptures in their lives but somehow find the strength to adjust, adapt and move on. The emotional core of these themes of great change, struggle and moving on are with the children in this film. But all of the adults struggle with major changes too. Moodyson focuses the camera most on the most heart-wrenched of the group of adults: Elisabeth and Rolf, and also Elisabeth's brother Goran, whose girlfriend is recklessly and desperately promiscuous. Thus the emotional core of the film is basic to human emotional desires and needs: the desire and need for love, and the fallout of loneliness, anguish and craziness when love goes awry and loved ones becomes irresponsible, reckless, or even dangerous.But from the perspective of the collective, this film takes on another ambitious theme: the interests of the individual(s) versus the interests of the group. We see this almost immediately in the film when we are introduced to the characters who inhabit ""Together,"" and this is where much of the comedy in the film comes from. Early on all of the housemates squabble not only about whose turn it is to do the dishes, but also whether doing dishes is even too ""bourgeois"" to bother with. Also, the tension of integrating Elisabeth and her children in to the group -- a tension which arises simply out of a reluctance to give up any more space to any newcomers -- is important to the underlying themes in the film. Elisabeth and her children badly need comfort and acceptance, but the children resist this new space of hippie ""sharing"" -- as though they believe it's a fraud in its weirdness for the sake of weirdness. And another area this film explores well within the theme of the individual vs. the group is that of sexual experimentation and promiscuity. Vital to preserving the group is tolerance of homosexuality and sexual openness, yet sexuality in a group setting can be as diverse as each individual that inhabits the group. And those who are most sexually predatory can leave lasting scars and bitter resentments. Homosexuality for some of the members in the group has lost its instinctual drive, and instead, as Lasse irreverently jests about toward his ex-wife, becomes just another form of political expression -- but also ultimately sex serves up a form of individual expression too. Sex gives the individual a greater sense of identity to the degree that that individual's sex life is so different from everyone else's -- whether it's a certain kind of homosexuality, a large number of sex partners, an odd choice of sex partners, etc. In other words, sexuality can define the group, but it often can threaten it too in that it too greatly exalts the conquests and exploitations of the individual.But then again so can many other values can define or threaten a group -- many of which are shared and others which are not -- such as vegetarianism, television, consumerism, Marxism, etc. Tension is there throughout over various ""doings"" (or lack thereof) within the household, and these different areas are discussed and battled over through the characters to explore how the group succeeds or fails to define itself according to any given value. Erik leaves because he can not stand the group's softness when it comes to concern for the proletariat against the bourgeoisie enemy. Lasse makes fun of Erik to no end over what he sees as Erik's fundamental hypocrisy. Two other housemates finally leave when the children are allowed to bring hot dogs in to the house. Fundamentalism, the film suggests, destroys diversity, and therefore is a threat to preserving a successful group dynamic, even though fundamentalism may have the best interests of all at heart. Tolerance, with some debate and disagreement, is the key to long term togetherness and diversity. Togetherness and diversity is a key component to happiness and a functioning group, the film strongly and convincingly suggests -- especially through its wonderfully simple games in the November snow.This film also spoke to me in how it seemed to also evoke the countercultural revival of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Something about these hippies seemed neo rather than old school, but that's understandable in that total period authenticity just isn't possible. Political correctness vs. creative and individualistic irony and drive also felt like a major theme at work here -- even though no one in the film ever utters the term ""politically correct"" as it was not a term that was coined in the 70s. As a theme, as much as a term, such tensions are of the 1980s and 1990s as much as the 1970s -- if not a little bit more. Maybe this is more in my head than it is in the film, but I have to think that the countercultural aspects and themes in this film connect to a 21st century audience so strongly still not just because so many of us lived through the time period in which this film was set, but also because we continued to live out these kinds of issues up until the present day -- especially many of us who were kids in the 70s.Interestingly, one thing the film really stays away from was central to the 60s and 70s counterculture: drug use and experimentation -- as though exploring this theme might infringe upon or distort the theme of drug and alcohol abuse -- which one of the characters, Rolf, battles in the film. But nearly everyone else in the film drinks too, so I'm not so sure. If drug experimentation at ""Together"" had been more explored in this film, it could have provided some more lively and funny scenes, but perhaps Moodyson didn't see the need either in terms of character or of theme. Instead, everyone pretty much drinks alcohol. Maybe drugs weren't as big in 1975 Sweden as they were in 1975 America. They were -- and for much of the population still are -- a religion in America.If this film had been only about Elisabeth's dilemma with her children and her husband, or only about the collective itself, it would not have been nearly so strong. But Moodyson joins the two main stories and sets of characters masterfully to illustrate his themes. Moodyson introduces us to dysfunction in the family realm with Elisabeth and Rolf, and then moves us over to difficulties in the community realm with the collective ""Together."" By joining the two groups -- the family and the community -- in his narrative with such skill, wit and simplicity, Moodyson shows how the two need one another, can threaten and damage one another, but can also fill in for one where the other could be failing. In this film, it seems to be the community rescuing souls from the dysfunction of family more so than vice versa. Families break down, but the community can help restore some sense of order -- and can occasionally help restore families. Togetherness in the community arises where a lack of togetherness in the family is most needed, yet togetherness in the community requires a sense of shared responsibility and industry to go along with the friendship and nurturing. The film suggests that not all forms of togetherness are ideal, but togetherness in general is essential -- and that debate and discord are an important part of maintaining and discovering what makes the group work. The film also strongly suggests that intolerance and recklessness, in the long run, leads to loneliness, anguish and despair. It's been so long since I have seen a film I could relate to with such ease. My sincere thanks to Moodyson for such a heartfelt, hilarious, painful, genuine film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWI3YjE3MDctYzg4Yi00ZGJjLTgwN2EtNTg3ZmNkNjVjMjJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In spite of the similar titles, there's no narrative connection between BIRD CAGE and DOLL HOUSE, though the films were later shrewdly retitled `Women's Penitentiary I' and `II' by distributors who hoped each film would capitalize on the other's popularity. Director Jack Hill, who also helmed DOLL HOUSE, says Corman hired him to make a sequel, but since the WIP genre had already become formulaic and predictable, Hill played up the humor and delivered a parody instead. Like DOLL HOUSE, the film features Pam Grier and Sid Haig in prominent roles and was shot in the Philippines. This time, Hill makes much better use of both actors as well as the beautiful locations.Perhaps the movie is best remembered as the screen debut of Anitra Ford, the exotically beautiful model who turned quite a few heads as well as price tags on television's THE PRICE IS RIGHT game show. She plays Terry, an American tourist visiting a Central American banana republic where her indiscreet flirtations with the prime minister get her in trouble with the governing party. She's sent to a bamboo shack prison for women staffed exclusively by gay guards and centered around a towering, archaic-looking sugar cane mill, the `big bird cage' of the title. The warden (Andy Centenera) designed the structure himself and is more than willing to sacrifice a few of his charges now and then to keep it in working order. At one point, an unfortunate prisoner is crushed to death when she's forced to crawl under the contraption to reposition a gigantic, misaligned cog. Prisoners who lose their wits are permanently confined in a cage for `crazies' while those who attempt to escape are tracked down by attack dogs. Regardless, Terry makes a run for it and nearly gets gang raped in the process. When the effeminate head guard Rocco (Vic Diaz, who has been called `the Peter Lorre of the Philippines') catches up to her as she's being molested by half a dozen local men, he dryly comments, `Why doesn't that ever happen to me?' As punishment for her attempted escape, Terry's left hanging from a rope tied to her long, dark tresses. Talk about having a bad hair day!The other inmates are the usual batch of rag tag stereotypes. There's the butch top dog (Teda Bracci), the sex starved nymph (Candice Roman), and a pathetic new kid (Marissa Delgado) who's befriended and championed by the heroine. The most original character is an Amazonian lesbian (Karen McKevic) who's supposedly so violent she must be chained to her bed, though she looks more like an unusually tall anorexic. She seems to have been included strictly for laughs: in one especially silly scene, she smears chicken fat over her body hoping to slip past her other cell mates so she can get her hands on a teasing tormentor.Curiously, the most entertaining parts of the film don't involve the prisoners but rather a nearby group of revolutionaries led by Blossom (Grier) and Django (Haig). Neither actor has ever been more appealing in any role and they work brilliantly together.  In the opening scene, they pose as musicians in a local band to burglarize a seedy nightclub and Grier actually sings on the soundtrack. Later, they wrestle in the mud before kissing and making up. As they noisily make love in a hut, another bandit ruefully comments, `What an army we could raise if we only had a lot of women.... Where could we find [so many] women to steal?' Thus are the unlikely seeds of a prison break sewn!Haig is hilarious in the scenes where Django `camps it up' flirting with the guards to weasel his way into the prison staff and Grier leads the eventual riot with her usual gusto. The film features lots of action including a fiery finale. There's also quite a bit of nudity, though unfortunately only a few brief glimpses of foxy Ms. Ford in the buff. She shows a bit more skin in her next two films, INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS and STACEY (both 1973).","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDkxODdkMmEtYzEzNy00N2NjLThjMmYtZmE1ZDFhNDAwZjYwL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In reality, it is a dark, scathing satire of American values. The marketing likely scared away a lot of people who would enjoy the film, while attracting an audience who was presented with something unexpected and perhaps uncomfortable. The comedy is quite raunchy, the tone is bleak, and the story is anything but formulaic, throwing industry conventions right out the window, which leads to a film that's more believable than most.David Spritz is a man whose life has become the ultimate exercise in futility. Each day, he wakes up and goes to a job that, despite paying a handsome salary, is entirely unfulfilling. His relationship with his ex-wife is strained, his relationship with his children distant. To make things worse, his Pulitzer Prize winning father seems to be disappointed in what David has done with his life.In real life, progress in one's personal life is generally made in baby steps. Usually, people don't undergo a drastic transformation over the course of several months. David attempts to improve his standing in life, at times failing entirely, at times succeeding in small doses. The results of these attempts range from very funny to downright saddening, and this helps lend the film an air of realism. This is a complicated character study about a man coming to grips with the fact that he's failed to meet any of the goals he set for himself in life, despite attaining a social standing that many people are envious of. There aren't any easy answers or life altering epiphanies; self-improvement is a long, gradual task that will probably never be completely fulfilled, and ""The Weather Man"" reflects this reality. While not for all tastes, this movie deserves credit for tackling a relatively conventional subject in a very unconventional, at least for a mainstream Hollywood movie, manner. I imagine that this film will be a bigger success overseas and on DVD than it will be in its US theatrical run.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NzAxMTE3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDAwMjY3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It can be done","When I first saw the plot and cast for this movie I was filled with little hope that this film would be any more than a stereotypical look at black/urban culture with the characters rhyming words for supposed comic effect ad the scriptwriter fitting a screenplay around the jokes. It us easy to forget that the film's protagonist, Ice Cube (who gave a fine performance) had just come off making the awful 'All About the Benjamins' which fell into the trap of so many of these comedies based around black people. Added to the fact that 'Barbershop' was released when there had been a spate of these sub-standard pictures such as 'How High', Friday After Next' and 'State Property', you can understand why I approached this movie with no expectations.Thankfully I was proved wrong as 'Barbershop' followed a simple structure to work. It had solid direction, a commendable screenplay, was well acted but more important than any of that, it was a story worth telling and that is the one thing that good films have in common. However, this does not mean that this movie followed the conventional ways of Hollywood and 'sold out' to appeal to a mass audience. If anything pleased me most about the film it was the fact that it retained a true sense of representing the black community and credit for this goes to the high standards of dialogue and acting. People who live in the suburbs can watch in the knowledge that they're getting a window into another culture, while people in urban communities can watch this with a comforting sense of familiarity. Another reason for this is that the screenplay is informed enough to not 'pigeon hole'. The characters are well rounded, with both positive and negative traits and the movie is not surrounded by guns,single mothers and drugs. This is not not to say these issues are ignored, as they are connected with one the film's major plot strands but despite the mass media sterotype (to which not all black people are unaccountable) the 'ghettos' of America are primarily filled with honest, hard-working people who just trying to make the best of an unenviable situation. While previous urban films have made a point of blaming 'whitey' and 'the man' for the troubling issues surrounding black people, 'Barbershop' looks closer to home and encourages black people to take responsibility for themselves and to break away from nature of 'frontin' that is slowly paralysing urban communities. One of the films best quotes is 'Dont buy yourself a Benz when your living with your mama! And black people; please can we be on time for something other than free before 10 at the club'. I think this is a wonderful statement and it encourages black people to reject the notion of style over content as that is what the film does as well.Added to this the well-rounded nature of the film is a diatribe from Cedric The Entertainer (who's performance is almost as hilarious as his stand-up act) about black icons such as Rosa Parks, Jesse Jackson and Martin Luther King. This is probably the most provocative section of the film and initially made me question the validity of these icons but after reflection, it made me realized that even Martin Luther King was a human being with flaws but that doesn't take away from his legacy. Regardless what's been said about Jesse Jackson he's still the first black man to run for President and nothing will ever take that away from him.While Cedric the Entertainer took most of the acting plaudits, this was a great ensemble piece that was well acted all round. My only gripe is that why can't other films of this nature stay true to black culture but also have a cinematic soul","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U1OWQzYjctOGJjMS00YTYzLWE5YjUtNjg1NWI3OTQyMWE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk1Njg5NTA@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

World's Greatest Dad is a comedy for adults: insightful, original, uncomfortable at times...hilarious.

The one is a lack of sympathy for Roseanne's character, Ruth. The other is a lack of appreciation for Meryl Streep's performance. Having watched this film many times since it's release, I think I can safely dispute this argument.This film certainly I feel has all the markings of a cult favorite. It's dark humor, over charged performances as well as the overall look and feel wedges it someplace between ""Heathers"" and ""Ruthless People"". More on the nuances that I feel set this film apart from others later, but lets first deal with the Roseann/Streep problem.Quite frankly, I see no problem. Meryl Streep's Mary Fisher is one of the screens funniest inventions. It seems quite clear to me that she enjoyed playing this role because there is no other way such a wonderful performance could have been created. On a number of occasions, there are lengthy shots with no change of camera where she drives through a range of hilarious emotions. How she handles a scene involving a dog licking her feet while she awakes is tremendous. I feel it is one of her strongest performances; she never turns it off, and always delivers it in the correct dosage. The issue with Roseanne's character, Ruth, is she is seen as manipulative, uncaring, a monster hell bent on revenge. Ruth, like everything else in this picture is a caricature.  This is very much the sort of role we would expect from Roseanne, the domestic goddess taking it all a step further. True, she does wallow in a mean spirited negativity, but it results in a positive outcome for nearly all involved. She takes control of her life and liberates Linda Hunts Nurse Hopper as well as countless women through her Vespa Rose Employment Agency. She returns life to the geriatrics in her care at a nursing home. As a result of Ruth's revenge, Mary Fisher at last becomes recognized as the serious writer she wished to from the start. We even know that Begley's Bob Patchett gets his comeuppance, and accepts it with grace and humility.There are dozens of touches brought here which make this a movie so enjoyable to watch. Firstly, there is the remarkable physical change in many of the characters as the story progresses. Roseanne goes from looking like a reject from a freak show to a rather zaftig Joan Collins.  Linda Hunt and Sylvia Miles likewise transform, and Streep goes from a pink, frosted confection of a romance novelist, to a black turtle necked, bespectacled writer with a gift for the ""post modern metaphor"".  A certain tone is set when the establishing shot of Mary Fisher ""pink palace by the sea"" reveals her initials, M F, emblazoned on the massive gate. Streep is given countless occasions to do great business for the camera, as in a scene where her complete lack of comprehension in doing laundry leads her to put half a gallon of bleach and several dryer sheets in a washing machine. Best of all, she manages to give the finger to the ""serious critics"" while on the Sally Jesse Raphale Show.  I honestly don't feel this film is as bad as many would like one to think. If you sit back, and let it unfold as I believe it was intended to, you will find a clever picture that has just the correct amount of overarched villainy and cynicism as many of our favorite black comedies.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTVhYTUzYmUtYTgxNy00OGJiLTlmNGItM2UwOGNkMjlkZmYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTcwNjUwNzk@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I wasn't so wrong, but I got more than this. Director Riondino (who also plays the the main character in a very convincing way) for sure has watched his Fellini, and the film comes up with some poetic dream-like moments on top of the realism, some visually appealing, some absurd and intentionally ridiculous. These are integrated very well in the otherwise indeed gloomy and realist portrayal of the reaction of an Italian company in the 1990s to the opposition it faced among (unionist) workers to restructuration under new ownership and changing their contracts. I also had fun comparing the Italian interpretation of realist proletarian acting to the British one in Ken Loach's films. If you like this kind of acting, this is a film for you. Some characters to me seem to be very nicely on the borderline between still just realistic and somewhat satirically exaggerated, but at the end of the day I suspect that they may be firmer on the realistic side than I can imagine (never having had direct contact with the portrayed working culture in Italy).What does ""Palazzina LAF"" mean, you may ask. You've got to see the film to find out. ""LAF"" means ""Laminatoio a Freddo"", in English apparently ""cold rolling"", some kind of production process, but this doesn't tell you anything about what to expect in the Palazzina LAF. Caterino, the main character, having been convinced by the company to spy on his co-workers in exchange for a promotion and a.company car, catches a glimpse on what goes on there and wants to go there, not really understanding what it means what he sees. The request is granted, so he finds out and so will you.Gloomy social realism meets some felliniesque moments, and they go very well together, helped by an interesting hardly predictable if somewhat simple storyline. Excellent film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDJjMGE5MmItMDBhZi00MjRjLWI2NWEtMGI2MWVkMzBkM2Y5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDYwNjc3OQ@@._V1_UY209_CR13,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Where you loved all the characters, adored each scene, and laughed at every joke, even after you'd seen the film so many times that you could quote the dialog? MY FAVORITE YEAR is that kind of movie!Directed with gusto by Richard Benjamin, the film is both a loving tribute to Sid Caesar's 'Your Show of Show', and the remarkable talents that brought it together each week, and a sincere homage to Errol Flynn, whose antics and larger-than-life persona, in the waning years of his life, still had a kind of magic that could enthrall a shy young fan, or make a woman swoon.Three dynamic performances dominate the film. Mark Linn-Baker, as Benjy Stone, based on the young Mel Brooks, is a shy kid who hides his insecurities behind a rapid-fire wit. The dazzling young star in a staff of comedy 'pros', Stone suffers from an unrequited love from fellow staffer K. C. Downing (Jessica Harper), and has an inspiration, inviting legendary swashbuckler Alan Swann (Peter O'Toole) to appear on the show. As King Kaiser, star of the hit series, Joseph Bologna captures much of Sid Caesar's legendary physical 'presence' and irreverence to authority. When threatened by gangsters over a 'too close to home' series of parodies about crime boss Karl Rojeck (portrayed with brute menace by veteran actor Cameron Mitchell), Kaiser 'thumbs his nose' at them, mimicking the gangster mercilessly. ""I'll KEEP doing it!"" he taunts. ""Why? Because it's FUNNY!""Then there is Peter O'Toole's 'Alan Swann'. With his own career a roller coaster ride of alcoholism, resulting in the near destruction of his health, no actor could have 'channeled' Errol Flynn better. Just as Flynn, by the 1950s, was a nearly burned-out rouÃÂ©, his classic good looks long gone, O'Toole's matinee-idol appearance, after years of self-abuse, had aged into a gaunt mask, making Benji Stone's film montage of 'classic' clips more poignant. What Flynn still had, in abundance, were charm and a ready wit, and O'Toole's 'Swann' is so enchanting a personality that you can't help but love him, and root for him to succeed.From the opening nostalgic strains of Nat King Cole's rendition of 'Stardust', through Benjy's futile effort to attempt to keep Swann sober (Red Skelton loved to tell how he kept Flynn sober on his program...he emptied all of the actor's bottles of vodka, replacing it with water...and Flynn couldn't tell the difference!), to a riotous Swann dinner with Benjy's family, to the near-disastrous broadcast, with Swann developing stage fright, and Kaiser brawling with mob enforcers...MY FAVORITE YEAR has one glorious scene after another, each unforgettable!One of the AFI's '100 Greatest Film Comedies', MY FAVORITE YEAR will bring a tear to your eye, even as you laugh. It was a time of legends, and heroes who would live up to boyhood dreams.Film comedy doesn't get any better than this!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjlhZTYwYzgtODA5MS00OWEyLWI1MWItZThjZmRlYTQ1MGE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDI4ODM5MDM@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I mean if you like a film then why should you feel guilty about it? If you are sensible enough to know that a disregarded film is poor on production and story yet entertains you then that is all there is to it really. One such case for myself is with Class Of 1999, Mark L. Lester's loose sci-fi sequel to his own Class Of 1984. I really couldn't recommend this film to anyone with confidence, I just know that I love it, have done since I rented it out of curiosity on VHS many years ago.The film basically is set in bad future Seattle where anarchy reins in our schools. So into the mix comes three robot teachers on a secretive trial basis, their form of discipline is tough but appears to be working. But things start to go wrong as the teachers start to revert to their battle droid beginnings and it all spirals out of control as they take on the might of the two warring gangs operating out of Kennedy High School.Think of it as a mixture of Escape From New York and The Terminator and you will be in the same ball park. Tho for the record this is not even close to being as good as either of those movies. Lester's movie actually, in spite of its reviled reputation, comes with some good acting credentials. Malcolm McDowell, Stacy Keach and Pam Grier are the ""name"" actors, while Patrick Kilpatrick and the cool Bradley Gregg are familiar faces that have fun with the material. It's violent and sweary and full of cheesy dialogue, and naturally the sci-fi led effects are cheap and in keeping with the budget. It's the sort of film that now would go straight to DVD without so much as a blink of an eye. But once a fan of it, you are always a fan of it, because true love never dies.Acquired taste? For sure. Coolly anarchic in a B movie way? Definitely.
