I'm a sucker for a good spoof movie and these guys HAVE put out some good ones in the past. I got enjoyment from the first four Scary Movies. Yes, even 4 had its moments. By this point though it's obvious that the duo of filmmakers are just beating a dead horse. They played their hand and have nothing left to show - Superfast! is just another nail in their already-laid-out coffin.Against my better judgement I've seen almost every spoof these guys have done. If you know anything about the directors then you should know what you're getting yourself into with this movie. I had no expectations, and the movie still managed to disappoint. It's certainly not the worst movie they've done - it's a step up from the utter sh*tpile known as The Starving Games and certainly more watchable than Disaster Movie, Vampires Suck, and Meet the Spartans. The problem is that this movie had potential. It really did. Superfast! acts as a spoof not only of the Fast & Furious franchise but of action movie clichÃÂ©s in general. The jokes that can come from that are endless, and the beginning of the movie gave a few chuckles and showed a hint of promise. But as the movie goes on it becomes more and more clear that these spoofers think toilet jokes and cheap gross-out gags are funnier than genuine satire.I'll give credit where credit is due: The casting in this movie was good. Especially the Vin Diesel caricature and the cartel kingpin. It looked like the actors were having fun and doing the best they could do with the material they had. It's unfortunate that their talents were wasted here because they definitely have a sense of good comedic timing and decent acting chops in general. That's about as far as the positives go. The awkward ""humor"" is just cringeworthy and uncomfortable. The toilet humor got old decades ago. A good amount of these jokes wouldn't go by well in an Elementary School let alone on the big screen. Superfast! is filled to the brim with moments that leave you thinking, who in the hell thought that was funny? Who thought making this film would be a good idea? And most importantly, why are these talentless hacks still making movies?","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM3MjQxNjkxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIyMTA0NDE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Even if he is not flavour of the month anymore, if he ever was, I make no apologies for that statement. I have a story I would like to share.In 2002, after the release of ""Pitch Black"" and ""xXx"", and even though I was possibly too old to indulge in such childishness, I wrote Vin a fan letter. I expressed my admiration for his work and politely requested an autograph on a magazine, featuring Vin on the cover, that I had enclosed with a stamped addressed envelope. A month later the magazine arrived back and it had been autographed.I have no idea if the autograph is genuine. It may well have been signed by Vin Diesel, or maybe it was just signed by somebody in Vin Diesel's office. I will never know. Do you know what? I don't care. Somebody went to the effort to send that autograph to me for that I think that Vin is sound, is cool and I give him much respect.I just wish that Vin appeared in better movies. This brings us to ""Babylon A.D."".Good things. The presentation of the near future world in ""Babylon A.D."" is beautifully done. Compare and contrast the difference between the collapsing, grunge-like, shabby Eastern Bloc, with the hi-tech, neon lit New York. Very well put together. ""Babylon A.D."" also has a really intriguing cast (Charlotte Rampling, Mark Strong, Michelle Yeoh, GÃÂ©rard Depardieu), some good action sequences and an interesting, if derivative, plot.Bad things. ""Babylon A.D."" is a mess. There is evidence of extensive tampering with and shortening of the movie in the editing suite. (I read one rumour that 70 minutes had been cut from the movie, although the Director claims that this was more like 15 minutes.) The ending is absolutely awful and apparently not the one that the Director intended.Director Mathieu Kassovitz has mostly disowned ""Babylon A.D."", calling it a movie of 'pure violence and stupidity'. There is nothing wrong with cinematic 'pure violence and stupidity' as such, but I for one would like to have seen Mathieu Kassovitz's original vision. It could have been great.Such a shame. I have always felt that Vin Diesel could have been the new Stallone, but bad choices have turned him into new Van Damme.Still, ""Babylon A.D."" is currently the #2 film at the US Box Office, so what do I know?","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGYyZjk2ZjMtNDgzOS00OTY5LTg1MzktNzRiOTNkNzMxNGQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

So considering it's the same director, writers and cast, I expected it to be pretty close to as good as the first one, but wow what a let down this was.The story was cliched, predictable, sappy, convoluted nonsense, and it was all over the place. The directing was sub par and underwhelming. And as much as Cena tried his best with the terrible material he had this time around, even he nor the addition of Steve Buscemi couldn't save this mess. Unlike the first film, there were zero actual laugh out loud moments, there were barely any smiles, but mostly eyerolls and cringe at pretty much every funny part being a huge miss and mostly infantile humor. As much as I'm a fan of Cena and Buscemi, I just can't recommend wasting 105 minutes watching this mess just to see them.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU1ZWM4M2ItM2RkYi00ZGJkLWE3YjQtMzIzM2ZlMzRiNWY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM1NjM2ODg1._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Sometimes they miss and sometimes they hit bullseye. This film is somewhere in between. If you go by the story, then you know this film is quintessentially Indian telling the story in a way so as to engage the western audience also. And by doing so, it somehow abandons that Indian audience. As an indian, there are far more superior quality cinema already made (most of them in regional cinemas) who tackles this subject with not just more sincerity but also with a heart. This film is often fails to do so and seems soulless. But having said that unfortunately AND fortunately this film will get a greater acceptance in the west because it presents the story in a way the West understands the problem. For instance, a small trivial detail might not matter to a western audience but the fact that the Stork even with his vast wealth and cultural superiority complex decides to travel in a sleeper class (or could easily be just General Class) of a train can and will erk an Indian audience. But for a Westerner that is just an exotic scene describing ""how Indians travel"". Same applies to the caste divide. For some foreigner the fact that one character is upper caste and the other is lower caste is enough for them to (have the illusion that they) understand India's vast cultural divide. But for an Indian that's just gross simplification.As I said these are just trivial details but they explain so much more about the intent of the makers. Maybe it was a conscious decision but as an Indian that's just mediocre cinema.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDVkMDRkMzItN2EyYS00ZTI5LTljYzgtNzRmZDQ0OTQ3M2VjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODk4OTc3MTY@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

"Breathe In","2023.0","R","98.0","Drama, Romance","6.3","60.0","Drake Doremus","Felicity Jones, Guy Pearce, Mackenzie Davis, Amy Ryan","15,652","When a foreign exchange student arrives in a small upstate New York town, she challenges the dynamics of her host family's relationships and alters their lives forever.","48","Delicate and refreshing take on a tired subject","Unhappily married man falls for beautiful woman half his age whom he believes will free him from his imaginary prison: this plot has been done so many times, very rarely with any creativity or passion, and so Drake Doremus' latest addition to the anthology, Breathe In, doesn't inspire much excitement at first glance. But Doremus successfully sidesteps the staple clichÃÂ©s of the infidelity drama and has crafted an oddly delicate, taut, and surgical film that captivates and succeeds in spite of a few minor plot conveniences. Keith Reynolds (Guy Pearce) is an ex-guitarist whose passions and hobbies have been stifled in favor of a suffocating teaching job and a quiet home life in a New York suburb with wife Megan (Amy Ryan) and daughter Lauren (Mackenzie Davis, a real find). During Lauren's senior year of high school, the family hosts pleasant but guarded exchange student Sophie (Felicity Jones), whose presence chips away at an evidently already fragile marriage and Keith's resentfully upheld responsibilities. Doremus' breakthrough picture Like Crazy (also starring Jones) drew its fair share of detractors for its unconvincing plot developments and shockingly naive characters. He still doesn't have a complete handle on how to let plots develop organically, and Keith and Sophie are destructive and weak-willed if not naive, but Doremus is clearly growing as a writer: the bumps are less jarring, the characters more understandable. Breathe In is expertly precise and poetically delicate: sensational arguments and wild sex scenes are excluded in favor of subtle tremors in relationship dynamics and a tentative, genuine mental connection between the two leads. A plot line that lends itself easily to melodrama is instead executed with restraint and grace: Keith and Sophie don't even kiss until over an hour into the film and instead grow closer through fleeting glances, shared passions, mutual desires to break free, and support and curiosity that neither have received from another person in a very long time. Refreshingly, for once, it's not at all about sex - it is sensual, but the leads connect on a profound, intimate level rather than a physical one and, strangely enough, there are times when you can't help but want them to be together. Pearce gives his best performance in years here as vulnerable and secretly needy Keith; he perfectly captures the crushing regret and childish idealism of a midlife crisis, and his slow unraveling at Sophie's touch is beautiful to watch. Jones, for the third year in a row, deserves some serious attention for her work here - Sophie is a stereotypical faux-intellectual, confident she sees all and knows all, and Jones retains that adolescent conceit while imbuing her with a deep, affecting loneliness and pain and a quiet but steely veneer masking it from the world. It's less showy, but more intricate and adult than her work in Like Crazy. Mackenzie Davis' first major movie role is pretty demanding and full of pitfalls, yet she creates the most sympathetic character in the film. Amy Ryan unfortunately isn't given much to do, and occasionally her character feels uncomfortable villainized, but she gives Jones a look at the end of the film that says much more than a 10- minute screaming scene ever could and confirms that she is one of the most insightful and communicative actresses around. There's not much dialogue in the film, and most of it is layered with subtext rather than explicitly revealing, so a great deal of responsibility falls on the cast's shoulders, and they more than carry their weight. Critics of Like Crazy probably won't be won over by Breathe In as in terms of direction, style and writing it follows many of the same formulas - a simple piano score, natural and unaffected cinematography, many close-ups and scenes where nothing at all is communicated verbally. The characters are less likable this time, and while they are more fleshed out and therefore easier to relate to, it's difficult to find someone to root for. But Doremus is maturing: there's less reliance on plot contrivances to move the story along, and instead he lets the tiny fissures, the soundless sensuality, and the growing tension drive the film to its explosive and agonizing finale. There is some great character- and dynamic-building here, and once Doremus has a better grasp of storytelling, he will really be a force to be reckoned with.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwNzY4MDYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODExMjgwMTE@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"
"Carne trÃÂ©mula","2023.0","R","103.0","Drama","7.3","69.0","Pedro AlmodÃÂ³var","Liberto Rabal, Francesca Neri, Javier Bardem, ÃÂngela Molina","33,741","After leaving jail, VÃÂ­ctor is still in love with Elena, but she's married to the former cop -now basketball player- who became paralysed by a shot from VÃÂ­ctor's gun...","60","""Una Vida Sobre Ruedos""","One of Almodovar's favourite conceits is the use of old TV and movie images as ironic commentary on our modern lives.  He loves the sheer trashiness of those millions of hours of low-grade output and he likes to mimic 1950's sitcom formats (""Women On The Verge"") or to splice 'quotes' from old footage into his modern tales.  It's a device which he uses very effectively in this film.  When the gun is fired in the apartment, a shot rings out from the TV set in the corner.  The fake news item of the bus birth, in black and white to represent the drabness of Franco's Spain, is a loving recreation of TV's golden age.  Women are mannequins in these old TV shows, used by men as objects of prurient displays, and of violence.  Our mass media have drugged us, suggests Almodovar, into being passive recipients of authority's handouts.  We can no longer distinguish between entertainment and reality.  David confronts Victor and wounds him in the testicles, but the two enemies are immediately distracted by the soccer game on TV and become 'guys together', forgetting their hatred in the communal false orgasm of the scored goal.     Names are always important in Almodovar films, and in this one they hold the key to the story's many meanings.  Elena is Helen of Troy, the creature who radiates unconscious sexual appeal and leads men into war and destruction.  Victor Plaza's name contains several layers of symbolic importance.  He is the film's real victor, overcoming the misfortune of the shooting and his own sexual imbecility to attain true happiness in America. Many Spanish towns have a 'Plaza de la Victoria', a municipal tribute to the great historical sea triumph of Lepanto.  In this sense Victor's name makes him the personification of ordinary Spanish life, a hispanic Everyman. Isabel Plaza Caballero, the prostitute whose wretched short life becomes a saintly image of suffering and continuity, has the name of Spain's great Catholic queen and the title of a 'gentlewoman'.  For Almodovar there is no contradiction in a whore having nobility.  Sancho is a kind of Sancho Panza to David's Quixote, the latter idealistic but impotent, the former iconoclastic and comical.     Almodovar's trademark is the looping circular plot in which the characters both repeat and vary their patterns of behaviour, crossing one another's paths and inadvertently echoing the actions of others.  Nowhere is this better illustrated than here.  The plot is almost literally circular, beginning and ending with childbirth in a wheeled vehicle, and Victor's life-defining moment hinging on the circular bus ride which brings him back to the identical spot where he started, a payphone on the Calle Eduardo Dato.  The characters penetrate one another's lives in ways that are totally convincing, and with a grounding in human psychology which few writers or directors can display.     Opposites and contradictions are everywhere.  Victor is the prison convict, the sexual inadequate born of a prostitute on a bus, who rises to become an admirable man, sexually proficient, successful, and a loving husband and father.  Sancho the macho cop is a spiritual cripple, relying on alcohol to deaden the pain of his failure as a lover.  David the real cripple is a national sporting hero.  The mother is the whore, the charity director is the heroin addict and the naive lad is the jailbird.  The welcome mat on Clara's threshold is the cruellest of ironies.  Marriage and sexual coupling are the fabric of the story, but in fact everyone is cuckolded sooner or later.  David used to 'service' Clara, now Victor performs that function, and the 'manly' Sancho is sexually redundant.  Elena copulates with Victor at the dramatic climax, and we recall that it was a sexual encounter between these two which launched the whole story.     It is hard to watch Almodovar's work without thinking of Bunuel.  The adolescent preoccupation with the 'obscure object of desire' is a good example.  Almodovar is fascinated by the vagina, and over and over again in this film we see men's heads buried between women's legs.  Two boy children emerge from wombs, David performs oral sex on Elena in the bath, Victor studies Clara's pudendum, David approaches Elena's genitalia along his wheelchair ramp.  The great sloping twin towers of Madrid's Puerta de Europa form an architectural pun, a visual representation of a woman's open thighs. Victor's emotional speech at Isabel's burial site (apart from advancing the plot neatly) is one more image of a man's face in a woman's vagina, the grave being the ultimate womb.  This particular vagina brought Victor into the world, and through its immoral earnings it gave him the money to live.     The first Christmas in the film, like the First Christmas, happens in a very unpromising setting.  It is cold in Madrid in every sense.  The final years of Franco's joyless, oppressive reign are conveyed very effectively in a restrained palette of blacks, browns and greys.  A state of emergency has been declared by a faceless Authority, grown paranoid about the danger of 'outside influences'.  Victor has entered a drab and frightened world, with a bus driver as his reluctant Joseph.  By the close of the film Christmas has acquired its cheerful capitalist trappings.  This is a 'Christmas in the sun'.  Victor is in the young land of freedom and opportunity.  He has come of age and is now the complete man.  The future looks bright for the New David, father and son.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2EwNDI5NjctZmMyNS00NzFlLTlkN2ItMzAwY2I0YTdkMzdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In a bid to out 'scroungers' the system has eaten itself and is spitting out vulnerable pitiful fodder like Daniel (played deeply sympathetically by comedian Dave Johns. He'll never win an Oscar but this part was made for him) and the lovable but deeply vulnerable Katie (played equally well by Hayley Squires - Call the Midwife).He's had a heart attack and his doctors say he can't work but the Benefits Police say he has to go on jobseeker allowance and look for work or lose all entitlement to any money AT ALL.It's farcical.She's moved from a women's hostel in London because she can't afford a flat in London with her two children (one slightly miscast as a rather posh daughter, Daisy).

Story is something you'd expect in a movie from 2008, all it's missing would be either Sandra bullock, Vince Vaughn or Owen Wilson. Some of the characters aren't really believable, maybe each on their own sure but not all of them altogether. Not really down to the actors playing them, more like how they're written. It isn't a movie that's made for you to believe, it's more just to wring a laugh out of you with an obnoxious plot, but unfortunately it isn't funny which makes the movie seem a bit senseless. Everything was over the top, supposed to be one of those movies you enjoy with your brain shut off, you could tell in the plot which scenes were supposed to be the funny ones with characters put in crazy situations but the dialogue doesn't deliver. The jokes don't land, and it doesn't really have any characters you could root for even though it's a movie were you have to pick sides but I couldn't care less for any of the family. It could have been written so much better, highly forgettable and I wouldn't recommend going to see it especially at the cinema, mine even had an extra sub-charge for this, yet a movie like like Armageddon Time didn't, yet was premiering the same night with a bigger cast. Don't bother, if you're still hellbent on watching though, I then suggest just wait for it to come out for streaming because it's not worth paying for and due to the lack of advertisement or buzz you don't have to worry about missing out on an under the radar gem.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlYzEzZjEtYjU0MS00NTkyLWFiYmMtYzllNjE2ODE2OWZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQzNTA5MzYz._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It is a challenge to watch and an even bigger challenge to decipher.  However, this film is such a demonstration of where film can go (beyond a linear storyline and literal constructions).  It is patient and relaxed in its pace, is free to navigate through time and place.  At first glance it appears to be a random compilation of shorts, but it really is a powerful interconnection of dreams, memories, archetypes, and life.  What is most admirable about this film, though, is its confidence in its imagery (some of which is extremely powerful) and its minimal dialogue.  This is not a film that ""spoon feeds"" theme and gives us chatterbox characters to walk us through what is happening. To be honest, I have seen the film three times and still am not sure about what is happening at every point, but it does leave room for personal meaning that makes it priceless and so rich. How many films can it be said of that even after a third viewing you have not even begun to realize its full meaning?

If you're inclined to consider when it was made, or you're old enough to remember when the idea of manned space exploration was actually exciting, you might even think it's great. The worst thing I can say is that it's certainly not fast-paced: if you're looking for a sci-fi action spectacular, this probably isn't going to be your cup of tea. The specifics are covered very well in previous users' comments (and in Roger Ebert's ***/**** review), so I won't repeat them here.There is one thing I'd like to clarify, though, if I may:Anyone looking at the user ratings and user comments should take into consideration that a (very) abbreviated version of this movie was shown on Mystery Science Theatre 3000 as ""Space Travelers."" I'm a pretty hardcore MST fan myself, and I agree that it was a funny episode. However, there's a certain type of MSTie that finds it entertaining to visit the IMDb and ""vote"" (negatively, of course) for the movies featured in their favourite episodes, with a view to knocking them down into the IMDb's ""Bottom 100"" list. Sometimes this is reasonably well-deserved: honestly, some of the worst (best) movies featured on MST3K would be indefensible in any form. Other times, particularly when the original is cut to pieces (this one lost approximately 1:15 of its 2:15 running time, while ""gaining"" some lousy incidental music and a shabby new title sequence*), I don't think it's right at all.If you want to watch an interesting, thought-provoking sci-fi drama, ""Marooned"" is a good bet. If you want to watch a funny episode of MST3K, ""Space Travelers"" (#0401) is an equally good bet. You can even watch and enjoy both, as I have. Don't let the strange mix of votes and comments here dissuade you from watching it entirely, though, because that would be a mistake. (A minor mistake, admittedly, but still -- a mistake.)--* Credit where it's due: most of this hack job was courtesy of re-distributor Film Ventures International, and not the folks at MST3K. If you come across a non-MST'd version of this movie that runs about 1:30, don't waste your time: I guarantee it'll be neither interesting _or_ funny.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzMyNmFhMTMtNGMwMC00NjZjLTlkMzctYWYyODA2NTg3ZTk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjY1NTQ0NDg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Soon she discovers that the girl was a former student in her faculty...","112","Absolute first rate thriller!","Tesis is a film about a film student writing an assignment on violence on film, which is appropriate because Tesis is itself, an assignment written by Alejandro AmenÃÂ¡bar on violence and the state of the Spanish film industry. AmenÃÂ¡bar has packed the film with nods towards the industry, and the reasons why it isn't working and this ties in excellently with the central theme of violence. The director professes that Spain's film industry will not be a success until it gives the people what it wants - and that theory in it's purest form is snuff films. Snuff films don't have any production values and exist purely to please their audience on an aesthetic level - and the snuff industry in this film is in a boom period! The idea of violence and why we find it is fascinating has made the base for many films, and it serves this one excellently too. The scene at the start sums all up; we open in a train station where someone has committed suicide. The station guards are trying to ensure that nobody sees the horror, and yet there's scores of people surrounding the tracks and AmenÃÂ¡bar makes sure that even you - the viewer - want to survey the horror for yourself.I don't know how successful Tesis was in it's native Spain, but it's certainly one of the best films to come out of the country in recent memory, and a lot of the reason for that is that the director has heeded his own advice and given the audience what they want. Rather than try and be deep and complex like many other foreign films, Tesis is a straight thriller, not unlike what would come out of America's thriving industry, and the fact that AmenÃÂ¡bar has knowingly accepted what his film is and hasn't tried to make it any more than that does it no end of favours. The film follows a relaxed pace, and the basic structure follows a mystery, which is being unravelled by two students; Angela, the one doing the thesis and Chema; someone she met because of his infamous love for violent films. The way that AmenÃÂ¡bar keeps the film flowing steadily ensures that we are really able to get into the mystery, and this makes the film far more thrilling overall. The film is about snuff films, but it shouldn't be mistaken for one itself. The focus is often kept away from violence, and the director only shows us just enough of the snuff to whet our appetites.The film's main point is to show us the mystery, but the characters are never made to take a backseat. The two central figures are given time to grow as people so that we can really get to know them, and even feel for them. In many thrillers, the characters and the mystery can't be weighed up evenly; but despite the fact that he's only a young filmmaker, AmenÃÂ¡bar has shown his brilliance by doing it to perfection. The characters actually compliment the mystery, in fact, because at times it flows because of who the characters are. This really allows the film to become compelling, and this is also where most of the true greatness lies. The characters are brought to life by a great cast of young actors. The beautiful Ana Torrent takes the lead role, and is joined by dÃÂ©butant Fele MartÃÂ­nez, who plays her opposite number. These two have an awkward chemistry, and this is capitalised on brilliantly. The third lead is played by Eduardo Noriega, who would go on to make a splash in AmenÃÂ¡bar's Open Your Eyes a year later.Tesis doesn't get mentioned all that often in discussions about great horror/thrillers - and I really have no idea why. This is a first rate film, and really shows its cast and director's talent. The Spanish film industry may be on the decline - but it wont be if they can pump out a few more films like this one!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTNjOGMzOTgtYWVmMi00ZWYzLWI4ZDItZjRhMjU3MzBhY2UwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

COLT .45 (1950) has got a number of things wrong with it, including ludicrous plotting, but is at least fast-paced, well-cast and dotted with frequent bursts of violence and gunplay. The screenwriter seems to have bent over backwards to tie a standard lawman-vs.-stage robbers tale to the Colt .45 revolver which is apparently being introduced to the west at the time this film takes place. The plot has to do with an outlaw's theft of a pair of the title six-shooters and the robbery-and-killing spree that results. The owner of the guns, Steve Farrell (Randolph Scott), a salesman for the Colt company, takes off after the villain with a second pair of the six-guns. At various points during the action, Farrell is accused of complicity with Brett (Zachary Scott), the robber he's pursuing.Zachary Scott makes a suitably snarling, mustachioed villain in a performance seemingly fueled by ample infusions of ""fire water"" consumed between set-ups. Ruth Roman makes a spunky and attractive heroine as the wife of a miner (Lloyd Bridges) who's in cahoots with Zachary. Alan Hale (Sr.) plays a corrupt sheriff also working with Zachary.The most interesting thing about this western is the inclusion of a tribe of Indians who pop up at convenient moments to help hero Farrell. Given the pervasiveness of corrupt whites in Bonanza Creek, the backlot town where the film takes place, the Indians prove to be Farrell's only dependable allies. The chief is played by respected Indian actor Chief Thundercloud, who adds virtually the only note of historical authenticity to the entire film. At one point, one of the Indian women supplies heroine Roman with a very fashionable white buckskin jacket that she sports for the rest of the film.The film is set during the James K. Polk administration immediately after the Mexican War, placing the action sometime in the 1840s. Given that photography was a brand-new (and quite time-consuming) technology back then, it's anachronistically amusing to see posters featuring a black-and-white head shot of Randolph Scott distributed to peace officers in the film.Shot in color, COLT .45 is a relatively low-budget affair with shooting restricted to the Warner Bros. backlot and nearby studio ranches.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZlNGE0N2YtMDczZS00Yjk4LTg3ZTItNjJlZWE1ZTljYTU0L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzA4ODc3ODU@._V1_UY209_CR6,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It is simply boring no meter how interesting the shots look and the events are. Although Lilly James (especially her) and Joseph Keery are doing well and their characters have deep dynamics and overall arc conclusions, Rebecca Antonaci's main character is written so poorly that I started to get bored from lack of affection. The film's content is very reminiscent of last year's ""Babel"" by Damien Chazelle, showing both the sublime and charming side of the bohemian acting life, and its dark side: with hard drugs, deadly crazy parties and dangerous, envious people. But only ""Finally Dawn"" is inferior to ""Babel"" both in creativity, and in the degree of fun or danger, and in the viewer's attachment to the characters. All actions and events seem very primitive and formulaic, among which the main character, Mimosa, exists passively and gets out of situations by pure luck. The film would have benefited from a strong central character, building a narrative based on the decisions and actions taken. But in reality, we have a story that runs on its own, trying to push through ideas about overcoming fears and accepting one's own imperfections, and that this is true beauty, but ultimately nothing works on an emotional level. It's probably not a good thing to say, but it's better to watch ""Babel,"" since ""Finally Dawn"" can boast only a few interesting scenes and missed potential, which with such a cast could make the picture worthwhile.Once again, it is not a bad movie in technical way but it definitely needs a more active protagonist to be engaging in my opinion.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQ2MTNlMTQtYTIwNC00Njk5LTg1ZmQtOTdjYjM2MzBmNjhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY4MjUxMzgz._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It had fantastic source material, a writer from one of my favorite shows (""Nurse Jackie""), and an actress from what used to be one of my favorite shows (""Grey's Anatomy""), but this film could not have been any more disastrous. There was a movie that I hated a few years ago called ""The Bounty Hunter"", with Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler. I felt like that film was as contrived as could be, and was unfunny, unromantic and incredibly unconvincing. I hate to say that ""One for the Money fell into that same ball park.One of the reasons why I love the book, ""One for the Money"", by Janet Evanovich is because its heart, Stephanie Plum was an unapologetic badass, profane and saucy. I always pictured someone like Sandra Bullock playing the lead role, a born-and-raised Jersey girl who was down on her luck, who finds her inner badass through a series of misadventures, but ultimately comes out on top in the end.I don't necessarily blame Katherine Heigl for ruining this movie. She did the best she could, even though her Jersey accent is laughably bad. She was simply miscast. She should have never discontinued her work on ""Grey's Anatomy, because if these are the kinds of roles she's getting, her future's only going to get worse.Julie Ann Robinson (""The Last Song"") directed, who I blame for the movie's obviously unclear vision. You get the idea that she didn't know what she wanted this movie to be. Maybe she thought that after all of the books that had been written, fans don't remember the first chapter of the franchise. Did she and the rest of the filmmakers intend this to be a film franchise as well? You get the idea that no one really cared, given the film's messy ending and sitcom-y writing.Liz Brixius (Nurse Jackie), Karen McCullah Lutz (Legally Blonde) and Kristen Smith (The Ugly Truth) are responsible for the travesty of a screenplay. Women ARE funny. There have been so many funny and smart movies that had primarily female writers, actors and directors, so why does this film seem misogynist? It's a mixed message, and an implication that I really don't like. Their version of Stephanie Plum is an idiot. She's not a saucy badass, like the one I loved in the books. Her profanity is turned down, too, because of the meaningless desire that the filmmakers must have had to get a PG-13 rating. Why would kids want to see this movie? Oh, of course...Katherine Heigl's inevitable ""sideboob"".I enjoy the work of Liz Brixius, considering that she is the creator of one of my favorite shows, ""Nurse Jackie"". She has shown over the years that she knows how to properly illustrate complicated characters. She is not beyond character development, and making characters fully realized...so what went wrong here? Why didn't she scream at the other two writers, ""what the hell are you doing?!""I can only imagine how bad true fans of the books felt about this travesty. There are eighteen Stephanie Plum novels, plus short stories, novellas and crossovers. People clearly like this character, and there have got to be a bunch of true fans out there. The first book was written in 1994, and there was talk of a movie then. It had been in development hell since then, and it's a shame to say that it probably should have stayed there.Grade: D-","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NzMxMDU1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzYxNTA2Ng@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Wilbur","58,732","Ten years after his original massacre, the invalid Michael Myers awakens on Halloween Eve and returns to Haddonfield to kill his seven-year-old niece. Can Dr. Loomis stop him?","417","Yes, 'tis true! Michael is back! And he wants revenge for his death! Huh?","After the failure that was the 3rd Halloween sequel, the writers knew that was mainly due to the absence of Michael Myers. So what did they do? They invited Michael back in for the 4th sequel and back into the story of Halloween. Even though I did enjoy the 3rd sequel, I do agree that I missed Michael. He's my favorite boogeyman, so it'd be cool to see him return and do what he does best, slice and dice and scare the heck out of me. Well is this really scary? Not too much, but still it's a fun sequel to get into and watch in the dark. I like the story and how they are continuing into the Myer's past and how far Michael will go to destroy this blood line. Although I was disappointed to not have Laurie Strode in this one, it was interesting to see how her legacy lives on with her daughter and now she will have the struggle with Michael Myers.Michael Myers has been in a coma for ten years, when his massacre was stopped by Dr. Samuel J. Loomis and Laurie Strode. Myers is being transferred from Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium to Smith's Grove Sanitarium. He awakens when he hears that Laurie Strode, his sister, is deceased, but her daughter, Jamie Lloyd is alive and well in Haddonfield. He kills the ambulance crew and escapes. Dr. Loomis races to Haddonfield in an attempt to bring Myers' killing spree to an end once and for all. In Haddonfield, his niece Jamie Lloyd, has been adopted by the Carruthers family. She has frequent nightmares about Michael, though she does not know who he is. On Halloween night, Jamie goes out trick-or-treating dressed as a clown with her teenage foster sister Rachel. Her uncle, Michael, follows them. Meanwhile, Loomis arrives in Haddonfield after an exhausting journey, and contacts the police department to inform them of Myers' escape. He and Haddonfield's new Sheriff Ben Meeker begin to search the town for Michael and Jamie. Myers has also blacked out the town's electricity by throwing a technician onto a electrical box and singlehandedly annihilated the entire police force. The girls barricade themselves in the Sheriff's house, while awaiting the arrival of the state police where Michael follows them and you'll have to see the movie to see the exciting conclusion.So over all Halloween 4 is a good sequel, it's not the strongest in the series, but it's one of the better stories of the franchise. I do like Jamie Lloyd, she was an interesting addition to the story and the writers are making these movies very interesting. I'm glad they brought Dr. Loomis back in, it brings us back into the original Halloween and he'll never give up until Michael Myers is gone for good, which we know is not going to happen since we still have 4 more sequels after this one. But the 4th installment into the Halloween franchise is a good one so I do recommend that you see it if you get the chance.6/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWNiNjBhZjAtMzVkNi00MTJiLWI0NGQtODE2NmIyNmU2OTQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The point is, the movie follows a grounded-realistic approach (not a surreal one). So, you expect the movie to give you enough information to build a believable world in which the story takes place. The problem is not with the believability, but with the incomplete information. So, at the end, you are left feeling that there is something missing.This could have been fixed with the very first shot of the movie, in which it could have shown a new born lying on the beach crying, with no traces of any human around her. This would have raised the question, ""who left her there?"" or ""where did she come from?"".

And there are a bunch of cool shots and camera movements during the fights.As for the rest of the movie, there really isn't much there. It's the most bare-bones revenge plot we've seen a thousand times. Technical aspects are more than fine, but there isn't much to latch onto.You could argue the same about GOAT action movie The Raid: Redemption. The difference is, The Raid doesn't focus on that bare-bones story. 70% of the movie is action scenes. It's more like 10% in this movie. Action is scarce until the climax and most of the focus is on the uninteresting story.My personal recommendation: watch only the hallway/elevator scene at the end.(1 viewing, 1/15/2024)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM5YmU0OWMtZDAwZi00NmM3LWE4N2MtNGFkYTY1OTYzYWY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDM1ODc2NzE@._V1_UY209_CR6,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

One of the best films ever made. 10/10","It is a little known fact that India produces more films per year than any other country. The reason that most people don't know that is because their films do not generally appeal to us, and we would see them as oddities suspended in their own culture. Possibly they'd be amusing or interesting to watch, but they would probably be hard to enjoy (to demonstrate the difference in taste, Roger Ebert attended an Indian film festival a year or two ago, and when he questioned its director what American film did the best business over there, he answered that the movie _Baby's Day Out_, which is basically like one of those Popeye cartoons where Sweet-Pea wanders through construction sights blindly, except extended to 90 minutes, had theaters packed in India all throughout its run; the film bombed completely in the US). Tastes differ. Humanity does not. This is proved to the utmost in Ray's masterful _Pather Panchali_. This film has got to be the best ever made about, well, life in general. It reminded me a lot of a Chinese film, Zhang Yimou's _To Live_, which was good, but its situations finally seemed a bit contrived. _Pather Panchali_ feels as real as life itself. To be sure, it contains great moments of sadness, but, for the most part, it concentrates on the beauty of the world around us. One of the major characters is this ancient woman, maybe even in her nineties. She is hunched over, has no teeth, and has crooked eyes. But Ray makes her form beautiful. He often finds characters with exaggerated and odd features. And there is nothing more beautiful in this world than the love between members of a family, and Ray revels in this. The relationship between the brother and sister is heartstoppingly beautiful. I could not say anything bad about this film. But there is one thing I would like to see: a DVD version of this film, and indeed of each of the films of the Apu Trilogy, and only Criterion could do this effectively, which is kind of disappointing, since I know a major film company already owns its rights and would probably never give them up without huge pay; a DVD version with scholarly commentary. Hindu symbology is present in a large quantity in this film, along with several Hindi ceremonies. Of course, I loved seeing this. I am not completely unfamiliar with the culture, so I was able to catch a little, but there is so much I don't know. A commentary track on a DVD would help me understand the film better, and thus love it even more.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmFkNDY5OTktNzY3Yy00OTFlLThhNjktOTRhMmZjZmIxYjAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTgyNTA4MjM@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Some of the shots are incredibly manga-esquire though, and the quite ethereal quirky nature of it should have been a giveaway.Horibe is a reasonably young man who lives alone in an apartment, and has a fairly mediocre job part time in a convenience store. He's got a private obsession though, with a model who's barely done much work besides a single poster which is lovingly placed on the wall of the store.The model, Asaka, moves into the neighbourhood (Obviously) and goes to the store to dispatch a parcel. There she meets Horibe who can't quite believe his luck that his idol is standing in front of the checkout (Yup, this really doesn't stretch credibility does it).Asaka is also endeavouring to become a star and her manager is obsessively working away to achieve that dream, and decides she should be a singer, with a song she happens to have.All the while Horibe's obsession is growing deeper and is affecting more than just his mind.This movie is beyond strange. It reminds me of Uzumaki, which was genuinely weird but never pretended otherwise. The difference here is Perfect Blue (What the *hell* does that title mean) seems to try to be mundane, yet resides in a surreal fantasy world where nothing much seems to make much sense.There are so many little nuances here which make the story just more and more obscure, and by the end of it you're wondering what on earth the point was.This most likely worked tremendously in anime, but it should never have been remade into a live action picture.A complete waste of time.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzg4NzEyY2MtNzcxYS00ZjViLWI4ZTQtM2UyZmRkOGJjZjBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMDQ0MTg@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The films portrayal of Elvis' birthplace of Memphis, possibly one of the most featureless, gritty and desolate representations of urban America ever committed to film, is a deceptively clever and substantial take on American subcultures.Without doubt, it is the first of the films three vignettes that makes the film stand out a little more than Jarmusch's other quirky offerings. Two Japanese tourists besotted with the King's legacy and 1950's American retro-culture in general, decide to visit Memphis, where they experience the superficiality his iconic status has been reduced to. The over-excitable and optimistic teenage girl, along with her more austere, cooler-than-cool boyfriend, are equally unimpressed with what the town has to offer. It's quite impressive that 15 years after its release, Jarmusch's depiction of alternative culture manages to capture the pretentious but proudly on-the-edges attitudes probably more apparent in today's retro-obsessed climate than ever before.Jarmusch's signature eclectic cast is another reason for repeated viewing, the subtleties of, in particular, Steve Buscemi's stuttering and nervous performance, are worth looking out for. As is the linking theme of Elvis' ghost in all three vignettes, a brilliant example of how to take a simple theme, and continually parodize its implications until its every mention leads to some sort of in-joke. The cool, laid-back pace of the film allows the humour to hit you unexpectedly, and the timing is often genius. Very, very, very watchable.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjcyMDYyM2ItYzFlNy00N2FmLTljNTAtODllZjZhNWIwMTVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzM0MTUwNTY@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

A success that has spread to a lot of other countries as well. I read the book just days before I saw the world premiere on this, as I got the book as a x-mas gift, just two days before the premiere.Well, to make a long story short, this is an unlikely black comedy in style of Forrest Gump, though darker and way more stupid, and filled with more stupid humans. Other films it's in class with here would be ""Fargo"", ""One night at McCools"", ""Seven psychopaths"" a.s.o. The book functions, and I'm glad to say that the narrative grips made on this as a script works as well. It's a good farce, which will give out many laughs. The two hours goes like it's one.The 100 years old Allan runs away from his birthday party, and starts a story which only he could be behind. Inwise decisions gives severe results, and looking back on his own life, he's done it before. He's made both tragedy's as well as things leading to happier consequences. They have tried to lock him up more than once, but he's not the easiest to detain.I enjoyed the film in a quite crowded cinema, which already started laughing at the first scene, and so i t went on. A mixed audience, with surprisingly many pensioners, which have read the book, will probably guarantee the film to be an even bigger success than the novel. At least, that's my guess.Well, how well is the novel brought to the screen, then? Well, surprisingly well, I would say. The most boring parts of the book is when Allan thinks back, and this is narrated down, so that the story happening present is the main thing. That's a major thing in making this work. There's been some minor changes done to shorten the travel, which unfolds like some kind of a trip or road movie, if you like, just as the book.The make up is brilliant, and way better than we've seen in Hollywood films (!). Amazing. Robert Gustafsson, playing Allan, is just turning 50, but here he looks perfect both in the twenties, the thirties and as 100 years old. (Well, maybe he looks eighty-something more than 100, but still it's quite passable.)Some of the CGI isn't exactly brilliant. This I see much better in Norwegian movies. Especially all the explosions are bad, but it doesn't hurt the story, since it's far from believable anyway. The famous persons portrayed are also quite good. The casting is well done, also when it comes to the actors playing the younger Allan. What annoys extremely is the music, which not only is stupid and too ""funny"", it's also very high in the sound mix. This is the worst bit of the movie. There's also some goofs, like the frozen guy and a tank lid closing itself, while driving away, but still not very big issues.So very well done, and the best Swedish comedy I've seen in many years. Thanks to a great staff, a quite large budget (63 millions SEK) and wonderful actors. (I'm sure it will play in the money!) The book is well taken care of, and if you enjoyed the movie, you'll find a lot more in the book, now with the clients you've seen here.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDUyMzU5MTk5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjcxNDQxNTE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He's the last of his kind, the wandering cowboy. The problem is the open range is disappearing around him. A guy like that can't live off the land anymore because there's no land for him to live off of. Everywhere he goes the land is either owned or forbidden for him to enter. Kirk Douglas stars as the last cowboy who just can't get it into his head how much the times have changed. Especially when he tries to rescue his good friend from the local jail. This causes more trouble than he can comprehend.What's so funny about this movie is how much of the story, scenes and situations were later used in it's quasi-remake ""First Blood"". The basic story line and his troubles with the law are quite similar. Walter Matthau and Gena Rowlands co-star in this awesome film about a dying way of life.

After watching it I was left with the feeling that I'd just watched a film which communicated something to me, but I wasn't quite sure what that might be. For hours afterward I thought to myself, ""Why did that film appeal to me so?"" The story is simple and straightforward. The details are charming and nuanced. The rendering is a true tour-de-force. The one thing that caught my eye was the sheen of the water as Mme. Souza and Bruno are crossing the ocean in pursuit of her grandson. I can hardly believe that was animation. Then I noticed the play of the light on the water reflected against the hulls of the boats at dock in the harbor. My friend pointed out the skill of the graphic designers in maintaining the proper camera angles of the projected live film footage on the screen during the chase sequence.The music is absolutely captivating. Everything from the opening dance-hall sequence to the extraordinary use of the Kyrie from Mozart's Mass in C Minor during the storm at sea and the entrance into the harbor of Belleville. Notice how the music builds in richness as the camera descends from the few spires at the beginning of the sequence to the dense mass at street level.Remembering the details and how they relate to each other and the film as a whole keeps you thinking about the significance of the film's contents. For instance, I only now remember that the opening sequence was drawn in the archaic, fluid style of early cartoon animation (Steamboat Willy, Olive Oyl and Popeye) because, of course, it was depicting events which predated the time of the film proper. The style served a purpose, beyond being an end in itself.For a long time after watching the film I remained puzzled about its appeal to me. I've seen a large number of animated feature films, but none have left me quite as reflective as did this one. I was less concerned with the meaning of the details. It is a cartoon, after all.I continued to wonder about Madame Souza's expression. About how the creator was able to invest such meaning in those simple dark circles set behind thick lenses and the line of her mouth, which modulated between forthright resolve and a gentle satisfaction. Then it occurred to me. Beyond the larger outline of the story and the details in which it is couched, it tells us of the power of one person's love and concern for another. I suppose we all wish we could receive such unconditional love, and it makes us feel warm to think that such a thing could actually be. Even if only in a cartoon.The film either will or will not appeal to you, depending on what it is you're looking for in an animated feature film. I watched it without expectations, and was left wondering, ""Why does it resonate with me?"" And you'll want to see it again.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWIyMDk0NGQtODEwNi00N2UwLTgyYTYtZDYwNjYzZjY1OTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Jackson, Kim Staunton, Toni Collette","74,722","A young lawyer and a businessman share a small automobile accident, and their mutual road rage escalates into a feud.","319","Changing Lanes: A turn for Hollywood? (8 stars)","When `Changing Lanes' first opens, the viewer is presented with a montage of jagged credits, trendy jerking photography cruising NYC streets, and electronic beats that are so cool they could be used for cryogenic freezing. It quickly seems apparent that this film is simply a star-vehicle for Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson; it seems apparent that this is a cold and impersonal genre-exercise for a successful comedy director, Roger Michell (`Notting Hill'), to branch out; it seems to be all these things until the end of this sequence when the camera glances out the window of a school bus out onto the New York City skyline, and there we see it: the World Trade Center. Unlike Sam Raimi's upcoming `Spider-Man', delayed after September 11th so that the WTC could be digitally removed, this is a film unafraid to date itself, and unafraid to look at human truth.Affleck plays the role of the oddly named Gavin Banek (did they take the name ÃÂBen Affleck', throw it in a blender, and add some new letters for good measure?), a high-power lawyer on the verge of becoming one of the partners at his law firm, alongside his father-in-law. Jackson is Doyle Gibson, a reforming alcoholic father of two clawing his way out of his hole and trying to save his marriage. On a critical day in both their lives, Doyle going to court to try winning joint-custody, and Gavin on his way to seal his career-making case, the two get into a minor accident on the FDR turnpike, causing Doyle to miss his hearing and Gavin to accidentally give Doyle a signed document that is critical to his caseÃÂ and it all unravels from there.The two tumble in a daylong haze of malice and self-destruction, sabotaging each other's lives. Whenever either decides to throw in the towel and do the ÃÂright' thing, it is too late and the other has already escalated it to the next level. His life quickly falling down around him, Gavin begins to examine it for the first time, taking a deep look into his wife, his law firm, his boss/father-in-law, and himselfÃÂ ultimately questioning his motivation for trying to retrieve the document in the first place.This is where the film really shines: many movies ask the question ÃÂwhat makes a man?' but `Changing Lanes' does it with honestly and authenticity. The screenplay, by Chap Taylor, asks if it is success, or if its providing for one's wife and kids, or if its true goodness, avoiding superficiality and delving into the motivations for each. In one telling monologue, Gavin's father-in-law, played with perfect tone by Sydney Pollack, says, `At the end of the day, I do more good than harm. What other standard have I got?' Unfortunately, the movie does not really ask the question of what makes a woman, even though both wives show real strength. The movie does not even seem to suggest that Gavin and Doyle's struggles could even be applied to women (obviously they could, had the movie explored that).Jackson, always an excellent actor, is great as Gibson even if he has performed better before. Surprisingly, in this film Affleck's acting actually seems to surpass Jackson's in this amazing performance that is probably the best we have seen from Affleck so far.All of the characters in the film, including minor-roles and extras, all exhibit a very human feel, and seeing real-feeling people on the screen has always been something rare and not to be taken for granted. The viewer comes to care about everyone in the picture: Gavin, Doyle, their wives, the guy at the bank, even the stranger at the bar.New York City itself is alive in this movie: it breathes, coughs, and gasps with Salvatore Totino's shaky, unsaturated, claustrophobic photography. Totino really looks at people and the city in the face, and does not try to make them prettier or uglier than they are. David Arnold's original electronic score is a refreshing change from the very poor attempts at orchestral music that most movies are now filled with. Arnold's score very effectively sets the mood and reinforces the tempo of the movie.`Changing Lanes' is a success for Roger Michell that shows us that a movie can have major stars, be entertaining, glossy, substantial, and pensive all-at-once.`Changing Lanes' is rated R for a fender-bender, destruction of office equipment, unseen infidelity, a shot of the World Trade Center, and honest depiction of the human condition.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI3MTc0NjgtOTUyNC00YzlkLTk3MTUtYzQxNGVhNDE5NmMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcwOTQzOTYy._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I'm not a film snob, and will try to see the good in most movies, but I just found this one hugely objectionable. It actually made me so angry, sitting watching it in the cinema, that I nearly became one of those people who makes derisive noises & spoils it for everyone else (managed to keep a lid on it though, just barely). It's so, SO intensely irritating! I have a feeling nobody here will agree but I need to express this. It's annoying because it has:1)Lame, clichÃÂ©d characterizations (not the lead, but supporting/minor characters, eg his family, particularly all the women in the family) 2)Patronizing depiction of mental illness (I don't mean to criticize Rush's acting here. It's more the combined effect of script/direction/production) 3)Incredibly heavy-handed, clichÃÂ©d depiction of the father's issues resulting from surviving the Holocaust (ditto above comment; I didn't have a problem with the actual performance) 4)General oversimplification, hollowness and reliance on emotional manipulation to cover up a lack of insightThe above intruded so much on my consciousness that I just couldn't ignore them & let myself get caught up in the music or the story.

In these stories, life was often celebrated through the study of the character of the human heart.In THE YOUNG LIONS, we experience masterful story writing in the screenplay by a man named Edward Anhalt who adapted it from a novel by Irwin Shaw.  In this fine example of the final years of the Golden Age of Hollywood we see a study of character, ideas and humanity seen amidst the greatest conflict this Earth has ever known, WWII.Here, we experience both the Americans and Europeans, including Germans. They are played as they really were, not as depicted by latter day directors such as Steven Spielberg and others who have drawn WWII Germans as silhouette, cartoon characters, all vile and evil.  Here, they are shown as singular human beings with personalities, hopes and dreams really exactly like our own.  The opposing forces are caught up in a madness that somehow swept across the face of this planet at a specific time, when really probed, for reasons quite unfathomable.  This was also one of the peak film renderings of Marlon Brando, whom some feel is one of the finest actors ever to have graced the silver screen.If you yearn for a fulfilling example of American Cinema at a time when it was a serious, respected industry, this is one for you to see.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmMwZjQ4NzYtYzAzNC00Yjg0LWJhZWEtMTg5NzA4ZmZmOTI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUwNzk3NDc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Atlanta, Georgia. The Women's Gymnastics Team Finals. The American women had never won team gold. They were, however, slightly ahead of the Russian team heading into the last rotation in the team competition. American gymnast Dominique Moceanu failed to stick the landing on either of her vault attempts. Then, her teammate Kerri Strug also fell Ã¢ÂÂ and injured her ankle. With the Russians performing in the floor exercise event at the same time, the competition between the two teams was so close that the American women's coach, BÃÂ©la KÃÂ¡rolyi, told Strug that they needed her to make her second vault to secure the gold medal. Strug limped to the start of her approach, then she sprinted down the mat, sprung over the vault andÃÂ stuck the landing! Strug then began hopping on her good leg as she saluted the judges before collapsing to the mat in pain. She had to be helped off the mat and later carried by KÃÂ¡rolyi to the medal stand. U.S. Women's Gymnastics had their first team gold in Olympic history and Kerri Strug was a national hero. It's this story that inspired ""The Bronze"" (R, 1:48), but that's all that Strug's heroic act of self-sacrifice has in common with this embarrassment of a movie.At the 2004 Summer Olympics, American gymnast Hope Annabelle Greggory (Melissa Rauch, from TV's ""The Big Bang Theory"") suffered an injury during the Women's Team Competition, but still managed to perform in her final event, helping the U.S. to a team bronze. She spent the next dozen years in her small hometown of Amherst, Ohio (30 miles west of Cleveland) living off her fifteen minutes of fame, in the home of her devoted widowed father (Gary Cole), depending on him for most of her support. She also gets free meals at the mall food court, has a reserved parking space in front of the town diner and she wears her USA warm-up suit everywhere. Hope's glory days Ã¢ÂÂ correction, glory day is an Olympic-sized cow and she is milk-ing-it! This might not be so bad if she were a decent person, but she's rude, foul-mouthed, promiscuous, dumb, self-centered and meanest to those who care about her the most.Certain circumstances arise that convince Hope to train another rising Amherst gymnast by the name of Maggie Townsend (Haley Lu Richardson) and make sure she's prepared for the upcoming Olympics. This puts Hope back in contact with an awkward, but sweet local guy named Ben (Thomas Middleditch) who co-owns the gym where Hope is training Maggie Ã¢ÂÂ and back in conflict with an old enemy, former Olympic Men's Gymnastics Gold Medal Winner Lance Tucker (Sebastian Stan) who is now a fellow Olympic Women's Gymnastics coach. Besides clashing with Lance and being mean to Ben, Hope's jaded and selfish personality contrasts greatly with Maggie's innocent enthusiasm, but Maggie and her hard-working single mother (SNL's Cecily Strong) are grateful to have her services. Hope herself ends up having more at stake in this scenario than she ever imagined Ã¢ÂÂ including her own hometown hero status.""The Bronze"" is rarely funny and often ridiculous. In the hands of more talented comedic actresses, this might have been an entertaining movie, but as it stands, Hope's steady stream of profanities, unladylike antics and self-aggrandizing behavior just come across as comedy by pummeling. (Or maybe, given this movie's subject matter, comedy byÃÂ pommeling.) The script, written by the film's star and her husband, Winston Rauch, is content to portray hope as an unlikeable, one-dimensional character through most of the movie and first-time feature film director Bryan Buckley (known mostly for short films and Super Bowl commercials) is unable to tease much that is worthwhile out of his actors or the script. Worse yet, he allows some of his main characters to speak in an accent that I have never heard anywhere between the Ohio River and Lake Erie, and the only well-directed action in the movie is not on the mat, but in a graphic sex scene late in the movie that feels dropped in out of nowhere. Propped up by only a few laughs and a little sweetness, this film couldn't even win bronze in a two-movie competition.

Mainly because they're so unrealistic, romanticized versions of high school and teen life. Usually featuring a bunch of stereotypes and some dumb, superficial plot. ""Over the Edge,"" hovever, is one of the few teen movies that actually gets it right.The movie focuses on a bunch of teens living in the boring, lifeless town of New Granada. A place with with nothing to do. No mall, no movie theaters, not even a fast food place. Nothing to give them somewhere to go or something to do. The adults in the movie can't be bothered with them and are more interested in bringing people into New Granada and developing the town rather than meet the needs of the town's youth. This makes the teens restless and bored and they resort to drugs, guns and crime to keep them occupied. The also misbehave in school and frustrate their teachers.The local authorities try setting up a curfew, holding meetings and assemblies, and even shut down the local recreation center which provided the teens the only place they can go for fun and social contact. All the while overlooking the real source of the problem. The local sherrif who occasionally harasses the kids (often unfairly) only adds to the problem. The frustration finally builds and builds until the movie's destructive climax.Based on a true incident, ""Over the Edge"" is a film which, unlike most teen movies, deals with more weighty topics than who's taking who to the prom. This is a much more realistic portrayal of teen life than ""Sixteen Candles"" or ""Can't Hardly Wait."" While the movie brings its message across, it does so without comming across as preachy.I'm also amazed at how prophetic this movie ended up being, gieven the recent shootings at Littleton. The nation's media and politicians put the blame on the entertainment industry (movies, TV, videogames, etc.) and are overlooking the real cause of what happened. This is very much like the adults in ""Over the Edge."" Closing down the rec center and setting up a curfew didn't make the problem go away because they had nothing to do with the cause of the problem. In fact, they just made things worse.""Over the Edge"" is a well made and underrated film that sadly rings just as true now as it did in 1979.

He moves back to his hometown with his wife, where he answers an ad for what Daigo thinks is a travel agency but is, in actuality, a mortuary.","131","A Nutshell Review: Departures","By now almost everyone would have heard of this Japanese film Okuribito (Departures), given its win in the recent Academy Awards, clinching the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, beating the likes of crowd favourite Waltzing With Bashir, and the Palme D'or winner The Class. And now after watching it, it's no surprise really, because if I were to go tongue in cheek, it's the novelty factor, given that the Academy would never have conceived upon the notion that a film coming from Asia and filled with death, corpses and coffins, would be anything but a horror film. Seriously though, Departures have Awards written all over it, with fine acting complementing a strong story to tell.I suppose the equivalent of a ""casketer"" in local context, would be the embalmer. And it's without a doubt a profession most misunderstood, and shunned because of our innate fear of death. We choose to avoid death where it had gone, and being an embalmer would unlikely be on any kid's wish list of professions. Despite the stereotypical negative connotations, it is a profession that is quite dignified, because the professional is entrusted with the responsibility of helping the loved ones of the deceased cope with the passing on, and to help ease the pain in bringing some colour before the final journey to either the burial ground, or crematorium.Departures demystifies this profession in the Japanese context. And like all things Japanese, the process comes with an elaborate ritual of preparation, cleansing and presentation, all done with great precision, skillful grace and utmost respect for both the deceased, and the family members. The profession depicted here in the film, is one of the highest order, where we see exactly how the casketers go about their job, and the separation of duties with the undertaker.Masahiro Motoki (last seen in The Longest Night in Shanghai) stars as the lead protagonist Daigo Kobayashi, a cellist in an orchestra who dreams of going places around the world with his wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) in tow. Unfortunately for him, his orchestra folds and he is forced to sell his expensive white elephant since he doubts he could make his passion into a successful career. Dejected, he convinces his wife to retreat back into the small town he came from, living in the house his late mother had left behind, in order to start a new life. Little did he know when responding to a job classifieds that a typo had given him the impression he would be in a career that involves travel. The boss of the shop Ikuei Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) hires him on instinct, and as the saying goes, the rest is history.For the curious, the film is an excellent medium to showcase the profession and to do so in good light. We come to learn the craft behind the job, and the necessity of it all, be it dealing with grieving family members, or taking care of bodies that are bound for autopsies. Departures paints through Daigo's experience, the varying spectrum of emotions that one as a service provider would have to face, as we journey with him from novice level. All's not doom and gloom of course, as director Yujiro Takita paced the film with well meaning humour ÃÂ again never slapstick or disrespectful ÃÂ throughout the narrative.The story by Kundo Koyama also excellently portrayed Daigo's relationships with his wife and with his mentor, where the former was like a rubber band waiting to snap because of Daigo's deliberate attempts to not tell his lovely wife what he's up to for a career in order to shield her from the taboo. With the latter from whom he picks up the tools of the trade from, there's a surrogate father figure which he never had while growing up, resulting in some pent up hatred toward his dad who walked out on the family when he was young.It's an extremely moving piece of drama that doesn't get bogged down by melodrama, and I thoroughly enjoyed its themes of reconciliation, forgiveness and best of all, being a professional and serving with pride. It's a fantastically crafted film with an excellent cast all round, and shatters all taboos that come with the profession of a ""casketer"". I know it's clichÃÂ© to say this, but Departures will be a strong contender when I compile my list of top films for the year. It's been some time already where I'm equally entertained and moved by a film, and without a doubt, do not let this depart from our local cinemas before you get a chance to watch it on the big screen. Highly recommended!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzOTcwOTA2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDczMzczMg@@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I must confess, it would be hard for me to say anything bad about a John Wayne movie, it certainly is not ""The Searchers"", but no where near ""The Geisha and the Barbarian"". Cahill was a milder Wayne as a family man, with a good lesson of being there when your needed as a father. A strong point that stands out in the movie, with the other elements (bank robbers, bad guys, boys in trouble) well incorporated around the basic theme. Andrew V. McLaglen did justice to the script, keeping things simple but well rounded, with a conclusion that will satisfy the western fan. After watching the film on TCM recently, I came to realize that it may be dated, somewhat, but a true measure of what good film making is all about. In a world of high budgets, overpaid actors and grand special effects, ""Cahill, U.S. Marshall"" gives what any viewer would want from such a film: A good story.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjYyZTIzNzMtZjRhYy00ODcwLWEzZmQtYjE0ZjI0OWY2YTdlL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

We are given a view from the Tanuki (a kind of badger) perspective of human encroachment on their environment.  Takahata gives the Tanuki all the powers that Japanese folklore ascribe to them, including the power to change their appearance at a molecular level, a full awareness of Japanese political geography, the ability to speak and write Japanese, and apparently their own Emperor (as they refer to the years of Pompoko). He also gives them limitations, such as the inability to remain serious for any length of time and the general tendency toward sloth and partying. Many Japanese even today believe Tanuki can transform.In this story, the ability to transform is not universal nor is it a task they can undertake without stress.  These capabilities and limitations work for and against the Tanuki throughout the film in humorous, touching, and tragic ways.The principle characters lived in the western outskirts of Tokyo in the late '60s, when a massive suburban bedtown, called ""Tama New Town"" was being built (This is a real place). They want to stop or reverse the progress of the construction, but are divided in how to accomplish this fact.  One of the more extreme members favors killing the humans and driving them all out--until he is reminded that he won't be able to eat certain foods, such as hamburgers, potato chips, or Tempura.  The story is focused on their efforts to stop the project and the events leading to the conclusion of the characters' situation.This film will have a bit of difficulty with US distribution for a number of reasons--the biggest being the fact that you can tell the genders of the Tanuki by looking at the males.  The DVD of this film will be released shortly in Japan and will include English subtitles.  Unfortunately, Japan uses Region 2 encoding and their DVDs won't play on American Region 1 sets. Unless you're willing to wait forever for Disney to figure out how to distribute this masterpiece, it's worth buying an all-region DVD player just to see it. I give this film a 10 out of 10 rating.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjBkODU2MjEtMjRhZi00M2M2LTg4ZjgtMGM0NjFiZTdjMzZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjc2Nzg5OTQ@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

A conversation starter.","Ironically, I picked this over the documentary 'Armadillo' about the war in Afghanistan, because I didn't feel like watching a truly frightening and disturbing movie that night. I felt like watching something 'fictionally scary'. It seems I should have gone for the war documentary instead, this movie had me wrecked emotionally for days. The story kind of clings, you have to deal with it, but it's complex and hard. It's a challenging movie.What keeps riddling me about this movie, is how on earth did anyone manage to make me feel sympathetic towards the main character, who's an occasionally psychotic, cynical and brutal sadist? Even when he loses his temper completely with consequences beyond anything you thought you would ever watch on the big screen, you find yourself on his side.Now, it's not an uncommon ambition for a director to construct 'bad' characters with compelling sides that awaken your sympathy, but this is beyond my comprehension. He's not a character you feel sorry for, he's not playing the victim anywhere, he's a sadist out of control. He plans things carefully to serve his own purposes and explodes in violence. Still, you want him to make it. You are left for hours thinking and discussing why on earth you found yourself supporting this character. Why would anybody?!? I don't know how this was done, it is, as I said, disturbing.I was thinking about this for days, I'm still thinking about it. There are many story lines to examine in retrospect, there's his childhood, the violence, the biblical figures and references, the forbidden sexual urges, the gender dynamics of the time and how Hudson and Albas characters are both in their own way revolting them. Casey Affleck gives a scarily brilliant performance, and Kate Hudson deserves compliments on her fantastic performance as the classical 'good girl of good family' of the 1950s who hides both a great social insight and a dark side.The Killer Inside Me is a great conversation starter, my boyfriend and I discussed this for hours (and we are far from an intellectual movie-discussing couple). Americans should be warned though, this is without a doubt one of the most graphical violent Hollywood productions I have ever seen.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyOTIwMTU5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY5NjA1Mw@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Great plot twists, great acting, great actors, great story. This movie kept me enthralled the whole way. It was when Affleck still had his charisma from Good Will Hunting. Charlize Theron dazzles us with her smile and charm and Gary Sinise is sinister as the intimidating ""older brother"". My only complaint was there were one too many plot twists in the end. Otherwise, settle in for a smooth ride.My favorite part of this movie are the prison sequences at the start and the final scenes. The prison sequence was very well done and Affleck is immediately identifiable as the likable car jacker. The final scenes are a great touch after the explosions, a nice touch to an enjoyable film. Sinise's fellow gang members are excellent as well, their intimidation tactics and craziness well transmitted to the screen.See this movie around Christmas time.

I am in my early 30s, and my wife is in her late 20s. We are moderate movie-goers, as in, we watch a fair number of movies, and we miss a lot of movies. I am University educated, my kids are fairly typical of their age, and my wife is also fairly well educated.We decided to go to this movie with our children at 9:20 PM on a Saturday Night which was actually also our 11th anniversary. It was a bit of a risk, and considering the rating that this movie seems to have, it could have ended horribly (considering it was our anniversary) We all quite enjoyed this movie. It's not overly complicated, but it's got a fairly unique plot, decent script, excellent character development, and it seems to steer clear of some of the more clichÃÂ© stereotypes that could have plagued this type of movie.It's pure fantasy, and it's nearly 100% kids movie, but we adults didn't have to ""suffer"" through it. My wife and I laughed heartily at much of the situational humour; both my kids laughed uproariously at most of the silly funny moments, and the situational humour. The visuals were quite pleasing, without being annoying (I find the latest 3D craze with so many movies rather annoying, for example). The voices were well cast, the scripts and voice-acting was well done and quite seamless. I didn't find myself thinking, ""I know who that voice is!"" at all, because it wasn't something that popped into my mind.So, I gave this a 7. Why not higher?, you might ask. Well, it's not ground-breaking, it wasn't epic, and it wasn't a movie that leaves me thinking about something for a long time. It wasn't lower because there was nothing blatantly bad about this show. It was all enjoyable, and none of us regret having seen this show on our anniversary.I hope my review helps you decide to go see this film :D","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyOTAyNTA5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODU2OTM0Mg@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The Baker boys are Jack and Frank (real life brothers Jeff and Beau Bridges), who eke out a living playing piano together at various venues throughout the Emerald City, a basic lounge act they've been doing for fifteen years.  Frank is the responsible one, because he has to be; he has a wife, kids and a home in the suburbs.  He manages their business, secures the bookings and is content to stick with a formula that works.  For him, it's not about the music, it's about keeping food on the table for those who depend on him.  Jack, on the other hand, is unattached and could care less about the business end of the partnership.  As long as it affords him a modicum of security as well as dignity, he is more than willing to just go along for the ride. 	For Jack, though, underneath it all, it is about the music; it's about jazz.  On off nights he will steal away alone to some small club to play, and deep down inside he knows that this is not only what he really wants, but needs.  And he knows he could be great, if only he'd let himself go. The trouble is, he's been with Frank his whole life, and as long as the act is working he just can't make the break.  Unless something happens, his dreams are destined to remain suppressed and unrealized. 	It is only when one of their regular clubs balks at rescheduling them that the brothers begin to realize that perhaps their act is getting a bit stale. So they decide to try adding a singer to the act.  After a memorable scene in which a number of young hopefuls are auditioned, Suzie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer) enters their life.  She joins the act on a trial basis, and after an amusing and somewhat tentative beginning, infuses it with new life, though Frank continues to adamantly resist too much of a departure from their original show.  (`Does anyone really want to hear ÃÂFeelings' again?' she asks him at one point).  Ultimately, however, Suzie becomes the impetus for change that Jack has needed all along, and the stage is set for the decisive moment, which comes when the dignity of the brothers is compromised due to an incident on Frank's part of uncharacteristic carelessness.  When Jack tells Frank, `We've never been clowns beforeÃÂ' you know exactly how deep it has cut. 	Kloves has fashioned an entertaining study of relationships, change, and the effects of complacent loyalty and self-denial; and the importance of following your own heart.  When Jack sits down alone at the piano in that smoke-filled club, we know that this is where he is meant to be.  Filmed on location in and around Seattle, with a terrific score by Dave Grusin,a supporting cast that includes Jennifer Tilly (Monica) and Ellie Raab (Nina), and a classic scene in which Suzie Diamond croons `Makin' Whoopee' atop a piano, `The Fabulous Baker Boys' is an absolute gem you do not want to miss. I rate this one 10/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDVlOTY2NGYtMmZmZS00MzdmLWE0ZGEtZGExODMxZmY5MzhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Quite simply, it is superb filmmaking at the very highest level, with extraordinarily subtle performances from the two leads. Director Marco Berger presents the story of a love affair in a series of uninflected, mostly static shots, letting the camera linger on characters' faces as they register attraction, desire, frustration, jealousy and love. In less skilled hands it could easily be boring or pretentious, but instead it's riveting ... and at times achingly painful. Both lead actors - GastÃÂ³n Re playing Gabriel and Alfonso BarÃÂ³n as Juan - are outstanding, as it the girl playing Gabriel's daughter. GastÃÂ³n Re, in particular, deserves to win multiple awards for his beautifully judged performance. Largely wordless, he brings to life the inner life of the shy, yearning Gabriel so fully that I felt I'd known him for years. If you were affected by Brokeback Mountain or God's Own Country then you will surely appreciate this film.

It's nice to know that, in this era of Hollywood churning out films that look more like video games or music videos, Verhoeven continues to make films that push envelopes and give the audience something to think about.Soldaat van Oranje, like its American counterpart twenty years later, is a film about war that takes its subject by the horns and doesn't let go at any moment. As we are introduced to the group of Dutch students whose eyes we see World War II through, we see a reflection of one rarely acknowledged truth: that numerous ordinary, everyday people, ignorant of what was really going on in Nazi Germany, couldn't have cared less about what was going on. It was only when the reality of the war was brought to them, as the Germans invaded Holland, that these students sat up and took notice of what the war was doing to ordinary people. Indeed, early on in the film, Hauer's character even says that a spot of war would be ""exciting"".Another reality that this film prefers to hit the viewer square in the face with is that while the war changed a lot of aspects of everyday life for everyone, there were some things that stayed the same regardless. In the scene where Hauer's character is attempting to board a boat bound for England, the German army's refusal to let the sailors on board prompts a quick ""back to the pub"" response from the working-class sailors. Business as usual in that respect.Considering that this is a Paul Verhoeven film, it is actually quite surprising how little violence there is to be found here. Granted, it is not a family film, and some of the torture scenes will make your blood boil as well as make some sick people like myself chuckle, but unlike the film that Verhoeven made with numerous references to this one twenty years later, there is surprisingly little blood and gore. Indeed, unlike the sarcastic satire of Starship Troopers, Soldaat Van Oranje tells its story in a restrained, almost documentary-like manner that is surprising as well as creative.All in all, I'd give Soldaat Van Oranje a qualified ten out of ten. It is not going to appeal to everyone, and some just won't get it at all, but it delivers a powerful story about the loss of innocence and freedom that should be required viewing in all schools, not just Dutch ones. Oh, and I cannot remember who said it, but they are right about one thing: the footage of the Queen returning to Dutch soil made me want to shout ""Oranje boven!"", and I am not even Dutch.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTVmMTQxNjgtMWIwNy00ZWFhLWIyMzAtZjI4YzI4NmVlMzU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTYwMTcxOTYy._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I really don't have anything bad to say about this movie. The actors were great, they all felt very natural. Despite of its found footage style it doesn't forget plot and character development. They took their time in setting up the characters and didn't throw a lot of scary stuff at you in the beginning which made it all the more compelling when bad stuff starts happening. At no point was I baffled at the characters or wondered why the hell they were acting as they were. The character dynamic between Gray and Deacon is especially interesting and entertaining. On the technical side the sound design was especially brilliant. If you have a good pair of headphones, all the better. I had some proper spine-tingling moments with this one watching it in a dark room with my headphones on. The movie really has that feeling of everything getting worse and more horrific till the end. The tension and suspense were absolutely terrific and built up perfectly culminating in a brilliantly frightening ending.The movie didn't feel gimmicky at all which is always a risk with these found footage movies. I'm not sure if it's groundbreakingly original and all that but it was very effectively made. This is the best found footage horror movie I've seen besides the Blair Witch Project, you should definitely give it a chance.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxMzU4NjYzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc0NzE3MzE@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The acting was so splendid it brought out each of Henry's wives as an individual woman, with the exception of Anne Of Cleves who appeared only twice and had a grand total of around three lines.  Anne Boleyn was excellently played by Charlotte Rampling, and we really can believe that she is innocent of no crimes when she is sent to the block.  Another standout is the late Lynne Frederick as Catherine Howard, as we see her fear, after her arrest.  Knowing she will follow Anne Boleyn. We inthis marriage feel for king henry, as he thought he had found his perfect loving wife in Catherine Howard. In all i would say that this film is a must see, although it is slighty inaccurate.  It also exaggerates, making Anne Boleyn hide numerous bodily deformations, while actually all she had was an extra lump of nail on her left small finger.

The magic is unquestionably in the music, but I'll come to that later.The success of Les choristes as a film (with or without the divine music) lies in its not trying to be anything more than what it is, a simple tale that opens up to you instead of manipulating you. You'll find neither heart-breaking poignancy nor rousing heroism. Within the short duration of a school term or two he spent with the somewhat notorious boarding school, teacher and musician Clement Mathieu had his modest ambition fulfilled, of having a choir sing the music he wrote, then moved along to a continuously modest life of teaching and music. Talented protÃÂ©gÃÂ© Pierre Morhange did achieve fame and success, but we have essentially been spared laboured scenes of Titanic struggles or exuberant jubilation. To ensure that I'm not misleading towards the other extreme, let me hasten to add that Les choristes does touch our hearts. It does this gently, sensibly.But in the end, it's the music. Purely the celestial beauty of the music alone will brings tears to the appreciative audiences' eyes. The story is touching. The character are likable.

It is directed by Tommy Lee Wallace who also directed Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982) and It (1990). It is definitely one of my favorite sequels and I love it so damn much. What I mean with no one talks about it: This movie like disappeared I heard about the first movie and watch it on TV, but I never saw the sequel in Slovenia on TV I don't know why this was banned and was never released in my country. Anyway I am a huge fan of the first movie Fright Night (1985), which is my favorite vampire horror movie of all time. While this one is a low budget unappreciated a step down sequel from the first movie. I love horror movies from the 80's and the vampire movies beside Fright Night Part I and II I only love The Lost Boys (1987) that come out 2 years later after the first Fright Night come out. I love Part 2 and this movie is damn good to watch at least better than remake tough I love remake too. I wish I could get this movie on Blu-ray or DVD but it is impossible to get it, so I am keeping the downloaded film on my computer.Fright Night Part 2 isn't good as the original film was or that great like was the first movie, but it has elements that movie works. William Ragsdale and Roddy McDowall did return from the first movie and that was good enough to watch this movie. Roddy McDowall is as always terrific and excellent in his role as Peter Vincent. William Ragsdale as Charley Brewster is good but his character is really messed up. Traci Lind is a hot sexy beautiful babe in this movie, I was happy that she was Charley's love interest. I know the actress from 21 Jump Street (1987) Season 1 Episode 3 and Class of 1999 (1990). I am happy she was in this movie, she was excellent and I love her character Alex she was fantastic! I miss the actress so damn much! William Ragsdale and Roddy McDowall were both excellent I love them so much. Tommy Lee Wallace did an excellent job writing and the directing this movie I love it so much. It is also one of my favorite vampire movies you even have a werewolf in here and a vampire who etas bugs and one vampire who roller skates.Plot: Charley Brewster and Peter Vincent must face more vampires which are out for revenge.Welcome to FRIGHT NIGHT PART II. Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall, ""The Great Vampire Killer,"" and Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) are back in the long-awaited sequel to the box office smash hit Fright Night. And so are the bloodthirsty creatures of the night.This is a revenge film about Julie Carmen as Regine Dandridge, Jerry's sister who want's revenge on Charley for killing her brother. Julie was outstanding, terrific and scary as the leader vampire. Brian Thompson as Bozworth as Regine's chauffeur and a vampire who only eat bugs and he know all their names is interesting, terrific and scary in his role. Russell Clark as a Vampire on a roller skates is excellent, but I still don't know was he a guy or a girl?. Jon Gries as Louie a werewolf was awesome, he was the only werewolf in the whole film, who can transformers in to werewolf anytime he wants. John Gries also did play a vampire in Bram Stoker's Dracula by Francis Ford Coppola, you'll remember when Dracula turns into a hairy wolf beast and has sex with the red head. I think he was supposed to be a Vampire modeled after this creature seeing as they mentioned stuff from the original Dracula book in this movie.I love the horror in this movie: Peter Vincent try's to kill Regina on movie set, but he get's arrested and thrown in to mental institution that is awesome. Alex try's to rescue him and in mental institution a patient Josh Richman as Fritzy helps them, to escape from the hospital I love this scene to death.Peter and Alex prepare to rescue Charley from Regina and they took all the weapons against the vampires - bad ass scene!The elevator scene where Regina burns from the sun light is fantastic epic scene while Peter is reflection a mirror on her and Charley holds her. That is my favorite another bad ass scene, pretty much the death scenes are awesome. I love the rescue mission on this movie. it is awesome how gorgeous Alex and Peter are rescuing Charley.R.I.P. - Roddy McDowall (1928 - 1998), Russell Clark (1949 - 2002) and Merritt Butrick (1959 - 1989). May all of you rest in peace your not forgotten. Fright Night Part 2 is a 1988 American horror comedy film directed by Tommy Lee Wallace and starring William Ragsdale, Roddy McDowall, Traci Lind, and Julie Carmen. It is the first and only sequel to Fright Night (1985), with Ragsdale and McDowall reprising their roles. Composer Brad Fiedel also returned with another distinct synthesizer score.I am giving an 9/10 -- a good score it has problems with the Charley character not believing in vampires, pacing, the humor in this movie and the scrip it could have been better. It is still a scary movie and I would definitely love to have DVD or Blu-ray.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWJmMjM2OTEtZjI3Zi00MDMwLWEyNjktMzk0YmVjMzY2YWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It is a damn shame that it has not received the cult status it so solidly deserves. The plot involves cliques, prep schools, and a very weird birthday party, but that is not what is important here. What matters is all the stops director J. Lee Thompson pulled out to make this into a near masterpiece of the slasher genre.Let's begin with the topnotch cast. Melissa Sue Anderson (of Little House on the Prairie) bravely fills a leading role that is decidedly unclear about whether it is that of a protagonist or antagonist. Whichever way you look at it, Anderson acts with aplomb! Secondly, there is veteran thespian Glenn Ford who, despite what some overzealous critics said, gives a fine performance as the doctor in addition to adding a sense of dignity to the proceedings. Also of note is the luminary Lenore Zann (a multi talented wonder who has sadly never enjoyed the success she deserves). Her enlightened performance is both savvy and sensible and she brings a sense of validity to a character that other actress would have simply let fade away into the background as it seems the misguided script intended. Another unforgettable personality is Sharon Acker. Seen only in flashbacks, she takes the role of the overbearing mother to new heights: a sheer classic in overacting! For those familiar with Sleepaway Camp (another piece of great 80's horror) Acker's whacked out mother just might rival Desiree Gould's Aunt Martha. While these are the players who really stand out, also of note are Lawrence Dane (as the enigmatic father), Frances Hyland (the headmistress), and Lesleh Donaldson (who makes the most out of her '1st victim' cameo).But enough about acting, on to the gore! And oh, what a gory movie Happy Birthday to Me is. The film skillfully manages to be bloody and raw, without becoming revolting. In fact, the grisliest scene is not a murder at all, but rather a realistic medical procedure! That's not to say there are no shocking murders, however. There are 6 bizarre murders as the poster promises, with the notorious shish kabob scene remaining one that will always live in infamy. The only thing more delightful than these sadistic killings is, of course, the twist ending! A real twist ending! What a twist! The twist is virtually unpredictable as it comes almost entirely out of left field and scarcely even makes sense! Oh, but it's just terrific! And let's not forget about the theme song that one hears shortly after. As an audience member, one barely has time to compose themselves after the twist when they're treated to one of the eeriest songs ever composed during the end credits.In short, Happy Birthday to Me delivers on all levels and now that it is easily accessible on DVD, you'd have to be a fool to let this unparalleled work remain unwatched.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGNjOWMwN2YtNTY2My00M2QxLThiZDgtYzEwNGIzMDVhZTQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It combines combines the classic dystopic sci-fi future with a scorched Earth, a few heroes struggling against enigmatic aliens and a corrupt military force, action style sequences that are at times quite intense, and the typical slow-paced Asian movie storytelling. Add to this a rich amount of influences from the FF games, including eight mysterious spirits that must be found in time or the heroine will succumb, as well as a lot of mythological references that must be taken for granted rather than analysed to bits if the viewer is to find any pleasure in this film.The trouble is that the FF video game fans wanted a story based on the games, or on their particular favourite in the series, and were disappointed with both the story, the setting and the characters. The average sci-fi movie fan, though, who ought to have loved the wicked general (excellently voice-cast by James Woods) and his huge space cannon, as well as the 'Aliens' styled surroundings and technology, was put off by all the talk about spirits and world souls. Leaving for a few of us who went to see the film with no real expectations, to enjoy it.Because it is a good film. The animation is, for the most part, excellent, even if some scenes have a too blatant 'look what we can do' boast to them. Particularly all the scenes of Aki's hair waving in the wind. Personally, I didn't think the story was either too slow-paced, nor too weird. It works well, especially if you like Asian movies. For the European and American market, though, there's probably not enough action and too much talking.If this movie had been released this year, it would probably have been given a better reception. The thought of fully computer animated films isn't as new and strange anymore, and with films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, The Ring and Hero, the west is opening up for the Asian way of telling stories. I hope to see more films like this, at least if they are this well made. 9/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc0NGU1YjItZGIxZS00MjMxLTlmZmYtNWUyMWRmY2Y2NDA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

There are some emotional scenes that elevated the film.The director manages to create some tension and suspense with the atmospheric lighting, camera movements, and shot composition.The effects on the monster ranged from pretty okay to sometimes looking slightly silly. It's a practical monster instead of CGI, which is appreciated, but it still looks rubber and fake in certain scenes.The final act of the movie was pretty strong.The story is very basic. Two people get stranded on a deserted road and a monster from the woods terrorizes them. The film tries to engage the viewer more by making the primary focus of the story about the strained relationship between the mother and daughter and how this terrifying experience brings them together. In some respects this works, but it's not enough to make the story anything more than average at best.The dialogue was also very shoddy at points and felt unnatural and forced.Overall, this is a pretty average horror movie.

Directed by the makers of film ""The Intouchables"" it looks beautiful and has a fabulous kinetic energy and has enough surprises and twists in its storytelling to keep you pleasantly off-balance. The story revolves around two charming conniving overconsuming scoundrels played by Jonathan Cohen ('temporarily' Lexo) and Pio Marmai (Pumpkin) who have wonderful chemistry together as they become unlikely chums. They get drawn into joining the Climate movement and into increasingly radical actions by the alluring beauty and charm of one of the leaders played by Noemie Merlant (Cactus). There is a cartoonish aspect to the depiction of over consumption and the possible ways out of debt but the passion and commitment of the climate activist group is presented in a positive light as one experiences how their sense of community and shared purpose helps them live with Eco-anxiety which is one of the film's themes. A Difficult Year sheds light on an existential crisis yet it is able to be funny with a good heart and its ending is surely inspired by activist Emma Goldman's famous line: ""if I can't dance, I don't want your revolution""","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDk0MGYxOTgtYWU2Ni00ZmYzLWJiYzctNzNkODhmYzE2NDkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDgzNjg5Nw@@._V1_UY209_CR7,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I was initially very reluctant to accept Michelle Williams as Marilyn, one of the most beautiful and glamorous women of all time, but she was extraordinary - luminous, even. She pulled off the role seamlessly, and turned Ms. Monroe into a layered, complex character, rather than the sex-kitten caricature we are all so used to seeing. Michelle managed to show us the real Marilyn - the woman who so desperately wanted to be loved, to be accepted, to be good at her job. The vulnerability, the mannerisms, the voice - all were pitch perfect. I have no doubt there will be yet another Oscar nomination in Michelle Williams' near-future.I was also very impressed by Eddie Redmayne, who's character was arguably the heart of the film. He was excellent as the star-struck yet sensitive Colin Clark, who helped Marilyn through her very difficult time on the set of ""The Prince and the Showgirl."" This was definitely a star-making turn for Eddie - I expect we'll be seeing much more of him. The movie is similar in tone to ""The King's Speech,"" and was helped by a beautiful score and wonderful costumes. Director Simon Curtis, who devoted eight years of his life to this project, did a wonderful job capturing the essence of 1950's England. The wardrobe department deserves a nomination, as do the writers. Kenneth Branagh was superb as Laurence Olivier, as was the great Judi Dench as Dame Sybil.All in all, one of the best films I've seen this year, and definitely the best (not to mention most authentic) portrayal of Marilyn ever to hit the silver screen. I couldn't have been more impressed.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzODYwOTIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE2NjAwNw@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Everything about it is so real that I remember the first time I saw it, I felt I had met Jesus. My relationship with Jesus had been torturous at best. Raised catholic by very catholic pre- Vatican Council parents. So, part of my rebellion had always been underlined by moving away from that pathology as far away as possible. Pasolini however, a Marxist homosexual, showed me a human side of the man I was suppose to follow that made sense, that touched me. Enrique Irazoqui plays Jesus in a way that may explain everything. He is just a guy but in his eyes, in his eyes there is something I've never seen before. Compassion without fake undertones. It chilled me. I loved him. I wanted to follow him. Pasolini wasn't trying to sell me anything, he wasn't trying to convert anyone he was doing what an artist, a real artist does. He was sharing his vision with me, with us.

As his friends end up dead, on drugs or in prison, he comes to believe he has been saved from their fates by various so-called saints.","83","Emotionally honest","What kind of writer reveals his troubled childhood, then directs a semi-autobiographical film about it, using a character with his own name? Bold, foolish or maybe both, that's exactly what Dito Montiel did.Reminiscent of Larry Clark's Kids in Manhattan, it depicts adolescents growing up in a tough neighbourhood, in the borough of Queens. For some of these youth, the dangers lay not just on the streets, but also in their own homes. Dito only knew he had to get away.At first the film is a little difficult to watch visually ÃÂ the editing and hand-held camera are abrupt. As the film develops, and the story shifts into the present, it becomes evident that this was a deliberate device to depict the nature of recollection. As Dito makes the journey across the continent to visit the ill father he hasn't seen in 15 years, a montage of childhood memories flood his mind.A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints at times is not an easy film to watch but is more accessible than Kids. Both films depict the dangers faced by adolescents. While Kids depicted the consequences of those dangers, this film portrays how one boy escapes from them, but ultimately needs to confront and reconcile his past.The performances in the film are strong. The actors are all very credible. The dialogue is saturated with authenticity. Melonie Diaz, who previously appeared in Raising Victor Vargas, beautifully portrayed Dito's childhood girlfriend Laurie. Rosario Dawson plays the grown up Laurie, and incidentally made her film debut in Kids.Producer Robert Downey Jr. who encouraged Montiel to make the film, was excellent in an understated role as the adult Dito. The transition of actors between 1986 and the present was depicted effectively. Special mention to Chazz Palminteri, who always has a strong but unforced screen presence.A film made with a small budget, it pays off with a strong, emotionally powerful and worthwhile story. I was surprised how the emotional impact crept up towards the end, as Dito dealt with his past as best he could.This film is highly recommended for those who enjoy human drama in shades of grey. There's no good guy/bad guy thing happening here. It's people dealing with the hand that destiny has given them, and trying to find their way. It is full of emotional honesty and plausibility that you can buy into. And don't leave until after the final credits.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3OTQwNDAwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQ3OTYzMQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

That's certainly the case with Tuesday, the directorial debut of Daina O. Pusic. We follow the story of a mother desperately trying to avoid the impending reality of the passing of her terminally ill daughter (the titular Tuesday). At a glance, as it's a premise that has certainly been done before, you wouldn't be remiss to assume this film to be an emotionally heavy tale, but somewhat simple and banal. But it's not what you would expect. Pusic has managed to shake up the formula and with the help of some magical realism, has told this story in a fresh, unique and interesting way.We get Death in the form of an anthropomorphic macaw bird who swoops in when your time is up, wrapping you under his wings and taking your soul away. When it is Tuesday's time, whilst she feels she is ready, she knows her mother is not, and so attempts to delay the inevitable by befriending Death and seeking his help in assuaging her mother. Naturally, her mother is not easily persuaded and furiously bargains with Death; eventually taking matters into her owns hands with surprising results.What follows is a somewhat absurd narrative, with many moments that are both shocking and humorous, but equally heartfelt. It is beautifully sincere in its examination of the complexities of accepting death; sold brilliantly by the performances of Julia Louis-Dreyfus (of Seinfeld and Veep fame) and Lola Petticrew, who bring emotion and authenticity to their respective characters. The pacing was a bit jumbled, with the first half dragging slightly, and the latter half, which introduced many interesting and frightening existential dilemmas, feeling quite rushed and underexplored. And whilst, the VFX interpretation of Death was mostly good, it is the deep, dulcet tones of ArinzÃÂ© Kene, both unsettling and ominous, yet sympathetic and comforting, that really sells the character. Pusic is definitely one to watch.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTNkOTM1OWQtY2I1YS00MmE3LWFhODItYTg4MmQyZjRmMjMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM1NjM2ODg1._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The viewer, I'm guessing, is supposed to laugh at these situations and just take it from there, allowing the actors to feel around. This takes the emphasis off the actors and more on the story, and therein lies the problem. ""Extract"" is a comedy built for one thing and written for another, and in the end, it becomes a mildly, yet forgettable movie.""Extract"" is so obviously written to be the next ""Office Space"", which will forever remain Judge's crown jewel as far as films go. The situations are awkwardly funny, yet there really doesn't seem to be a balance to most of it. Judge's newest is rather repetitive in its approach - Joel goes to work, is unhappy. Joel comes home, is interrupted by his annoying neighbor. Joel goes to the bar. Ben Affleck says something witty. Mila Kunis looks hot. The film continues down this path aimlessly, not really offering to build up any suspense as to what could happen with our characters, until a really useless event in the plot causes the movie to end. It experiments with a bit of character development in the lead role of Joel, but everyone else is either a clichÃÂ©, someone who is not worth developing, or a plot device.You'll notice that I said the film is written to be an awkward situational comedy, and it clearly is - however, the comedians cast in parts are not really meant for these kind of roles. For some (Jason Bateman, Dustin Milligan), it works and they fit their characters well. For others (Mila Kunis, Clifton Collins Jr.), both actor and character seem out of place, like they belong in a more slapstick or more vulgar and/or stereotypical comedy. The real plus comes from Ben Affleck, who is hilarious just about every time he graces us with his presence, while Kristen Wiig is VASTLY underused. Clifton Collins Jr. is great as well, while Mila Kunis is almost as out of place as she was in ""Max Payne"". If anything, this film has the most random cameo of all time from Gene Simmons.Maybe Judge has lost his touch, though I doubt that, because he has a great cameo in the film as well...but his writing is done in a way that it feels like he's building up to one huge punchline that never comes. Don't get me wrong, most people will have a few chuckles and smiles at ""Extract"", but with Judge's name on it, you'd expect it to be a bit better than the occasional laugh and grin. It doesn't know whether to be absurd, as some characters and jokes are, or the awkward comedy that Judge is so great at doing.To put it simple, ""Extract"" lacks the strength of plot, relatability, and character development that Judge's previous works have had. Joel is no Peter from ""Office Space"". Ben Affleck's character, an obvious rehash of Deidrich Bader's character from the same movie, is the one saving grace, and even he isn't good enough to stop this from becoming nothing more than a mediocre comedy that's best saved for a DVD rental.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzNzU3OTQ4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY3MzA4Mg@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Julie Andrews and Paul Newman work really well together - a very sexy scene early in the film is a delight, filmed in extreme close-up.  And Lila Kedrova's cameo is Oscar worthy.  This is also a memorable look at the Cold War at its height, and although the pro-West propaganda is a little thick at times, there is still a sense of the absurdity of the situation. And there is a murder scene of unbelievable savagery that really left me shaken - excellent work here from Newman and Carolyn Conwell.

You know what I'm talking about--the movies that are short on plot, acting or both which are bolstered up by loud FX and revolutionary digital animation so that it becomes ""special effects in search of a picture"".  I'm delighted to say that CALENDAR GIRLS has nothing of the kind.  It's all about the plot, all about the women involved, and all about laughing so hard you cry--or maybe about being able to forget tears in deep laughter, if only for a moment.The acting is superb.  One hardly needs to mention Helen Mirren.  I read one comment that pans her Yorkshire accent; well, I attended it with an Englishwoman who is very familiar with such an accent and she specifically told me that her accent never slipped, so I've no idea where that comment came from.Having been involved with the world of cancer treatment recently (fortunately with a happier outcome for my mother, a survivor of breast cancer) this movie strikes close to home.  It's completely accurate; it's not pretty and it's often degrading, no matter how much the oncological staff tries to make it easier.  The movie is also accurate in the kind of sentiments it expresses about cancer.  People who have been touched by that filthy disease will do ANYTHING to fight it.  (I sat on a spin bike for twenty-four consecutive hours in aid of breast cancer less than two weeks ago, so I do know what I'm talking about.)  Yes, a few liberties with the real story have been taken.  So what?  The result is a coherent progression that is more interested in human beings than plot details.  And isn't that what it should be about?I've heard this dismissed as a movie for ""older people"".  I'm proud to be of that number--after all, at the age of thirty-five I'm ten years out of the target demographic at which Hollywood films are aimed.  If by ""older people"" they mean people who want a movie to be about something important as opposed to the latest spectacular light show, I'm glad to be of that number.

The whole theme of the movie got somewhat disrupted, the original Man from earth was a complete scientific exploration on its own, there was a touch of mystery, facts, a classic debate over human existence and the Gods, where as the sequel was more centred towards John's character, his personal life, and a bunch of school kids investigating his identity, no mystery, no debates, nothing new..viewers already know who and what John is.

I should note that I'm SO not a fan of Andrew ""Dice"" Clay, I think his stand-up shows suck, big time. But here, he's simply fantastic as Ford Fairlane, the Rock'n Roll Detective, who mostly gets paid in the form of gifts or memorabilia.Dice's jokes here work perfectly each time, one quotable line after another (""so many assholes, so few bullets"", ""you're a poet and didn't know it"", ""talking with Zuzu is like ************ with a cheese-grinder, slightly enjoyable but mostly painful"" to name a few). The film never takes itself seriously, yet somehow keeps it from ever going into slapstick territory.Supporting actors do well also, Presly is always a stunner, Wayne Newton gives his best ever performance as Fairlane's nemesis and Ed O'Neill is a riot as a former disco singer turned detective. Robert Englund gives a rather amusing performance as a very inept crook who's ultimate fate is nothing short of hilarious.Finnish director Harlin directs with a sure hand, everything in the technical department in tip top shape and it's very visually stylish at times. The Adventures of Ford Fairlane is definitely not for everyone, but it's not only for die hard Clay fans, since I sure as hell ain't one of them. But I think he's perfect here and the film is very funny and comes highly recommended by me.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk5ZjVlYWYtZDQ3NC00OTE2LWFmYzAtNmQ5Y2UzZmRjM2I0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The reason I usually don't like him is that, though he is a great technical director and visual stylist, his scripts are heavy-handed and one-sided to the point of absurdity. But not here. In fact, the script is perhaps the most impressive element in this whole movie, not only for how ambiguous and even-handed it is in dealing with Nixon as a character, but also for the brilliant way it moves around in time. It starts with Nixon, feeling embattled in the White House in 1973 as the Watergate hearings are upon him, and uses the device of him listening to his secret tapes to jump back and forth to previous eras, flawlessly moving between past and present to give an impressionistic, kaleidoscopic overview of the man's life, instead of following the staid and ho-hum linear approach most movie biographies take (most recent example: ""Man on the Moon"", the bio on Andy Kaufman which was a snoozer in spite of a great performance by Jim Carrey mainly because of the dry boring, ""This happened. . .And then this happened"" approach).Another reason to see this film is the brilliant, absolutely overwhelming lead performance by Anthony Hopkins; his Nixon may not look or sound exactly like the 37th president (but come on, except maybe for Ed Sullivan, who does?) but he embodies his qualities - strengths as well as weaknesses - to such an enormous degree that he simply BECOMES Nixon, at least for the three hours the movie is on screen.I have to say, though, I was not nearly as impressed as every one else (critics and general audiences alike) seems to be about Joan Allen as Pat Nixon. It's nothing against her performance, she did fine, it's just that as written, the part is rather weak. In fact, I was much more bothered about the liberties the filmmakers took in fleshing out her character than in all the political events; it's like, whenever they wanted to have someone blast Nixon or act as his conscience, they'd trot out Ol' Pat, giving her some of the most embarrasingly ""speechified"" moments in all of the movies - almost none of their scenes together ringed true as husband as wife; it was more like Nixon sitting across from the Filmmakers' Conscience. In fact, she's angry at him so often in the film you have to wonder, what exactly does she love about the man? The film never answers (or attempts to answer) this question.But this one minor quibble is not enough to make me downgrade this film. It is an absolutely stunning achievement by any stretch of the imagination, and it contains some interesting thematic and technical echoes of both Citizen Kane (cavernous high ceiling scenes, a ""March of Time""-type newsreel on Nixon, a dinner scene between Dick and Pat at a long, impersonal table) as well as The Godfather (the burnished, half-dark half-light cinematography, several ""chamber of power"" scenes in tight, dark and claustrophobic rooms)that I found, in context, to be totally appropriate. It paints both Nixon and the times he (and the country) lived through on a grand and mythic scale that was truly awesome and, once again, entirely appropriate. Yes, it's a film that is at times big, loud and bombastic (because so, after all, was Nixon himself) but, just as often quiet, contemplative and told at an achingly *human* level. The contrast between these two states is what gives the film a good deal of its overall power and, as I've said, I never would have believed that Stone would have been capable of doing the smaller, quieter scenes so well.This is a good film to have on tape or DVD, for two reasons. It's so long, and so dense with facts, characters and events, that you're not likely to want to watch it all the way straight through (the first time I saw it was in the theater and though I was held spellbound, I began wishing for an intermission at about the two-hour mark, not so much to stretch my legs but to give my brain a chance to process all I'd seen and heard so far). Also, and more importantly, the videotape includes after the credits two scenes cut out of the final film for time purposes. In both cases, I believe, a severe mistake was made - these are both, I believe, ESSENTIAL sequences; not just nice to have as an additional bargain, but scenes which Stone should have fought tooth and nail to keep in (even cutting out some others if he had to - my vote would have been to excise a few of those Pat Nixon scenes instead). Once scene involves Nixon's visit to the CIA and another a discussion between Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover in the Oval Office. The first scene is a masterpiece of writing and acting (with Sam Waterston as CIA Director Richard Helms, otherwise in no other scene of the movie) and the other is, I think, key in understanding Nixon's motivation to begin taping his White House conversations in the first place (also - an issue which is touched on no other place in the movie). I feel that these two scenes should be edited back into their appropriate places in the movie; seeing them separated from the rest of the film is better than not seeing them at all, but they really belong as part of the entire story.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzBlOWY0ZmEtZjdkYS00ZGU0LWEwN2YtYzBkNDM5ZDBjMmI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyOTc@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I even saw Deconstructing Harry twice, (after which I read a Woody Allen collection of short pieces and rented both Bananas and Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex).  Hey, what can I say ÃÂ I thought The Purple Rose Of Cairo might've been a fluke, but I guess I'm just a Woody Allen fan now.Deconstructing Harry is laugh-out-loud funny, tracing the steps of Harry Block, a neurotic, foul-mouthed, Jewish, self-hating, pill-popping, womanizing alcoholic (three wives and six therapists later) that oddly enough, resembles Woody Allen and his own life (give or take a few things). Block has (giggle) writer's block, and can't write about his life.  As a result, he becomes `unfocused,' entangling himself in fact and fiction (i.e. he interacts with his own characters).  `You expect the world to adjust to the distortion you've become,' Harry's analyst tells him.  What follows is a series of skits that interact with the past and present and the real and imagined ÃÂ it's kind of like watching a Kurt Vonnegut story edited by Quentin Tarentino.  The all-star cast is phenomenal: Robin Williams is hilarious, Kirstie Alley is hysterically funny, Julia Louis-Dreyfus is super-sexy and  Elizabeth Shue is as sweet as sugar.  Billy Crystal even pulls off a good role as the Devil.  But other than the characterization, Woody's new flick is witty, cold-hearted, extremely vulgar, often tasteless and perfectly profane with enough catch-lines to keep film buffs cracking for years (`I always keep a little hooker money around').

Ebert said that ""Raging Bull"" was a great movie. People would protest that they didn't want to see it because they didn't want to see a film about boxers. No, Ebert insisted. The subject matter of a film is not the heart of the film. Rather, it's how well a film is made that matters. An expertly made film about boxers is better than a badly made film about a topic you may be interested in. So, no, I'm not a man; I'm not divorced. But ""The Odd Couple"" was so well made that I fell in love with it. I surprised myself by laughing out loud throughout the film. ""The Odd Couple,"" of course, is the story of news writer Felix Unger leaving his wife and children and moving in with his friend, sports writer Oscar Madison, who is himself a divorcÃÂ©e. Oscar lives in an eight-room Manhattan apartment, which he used to share with his wife and their kids. Felix is neat; Oscar is messy. Sounds pretty trite.But the movie is a revelation. The script reveals surprising depth about love, hate, and human relationships. The Walter-Matthau-Jack-Lemmon team is like a well-oiled machine Ã¢ÂÂ they seem to have perfected their shtick together through several lifetimes. Jack Lemmon plays the entire movie completely straight. He gives the exact same kind of performance as he did when he was acting in ""The Days of Wine and Roses,"" a hyper serious film about alcoholism. When Lemmon, as Felix, is upset about his meatloaf burning, he shows as much agony as he showed in the previous film about a drunk ruining his own life. It's hysterically funny to watch this poor schmuck wrestle with his petty obsessions and compulsions, oblivious to how he affects others. Even as you laugh at him, you realize he can't help himself. Felix Unger has Asperger's. What has changed in America, and American film, that this film from 1968 feels like a time capsule from a lost moment in America? Oscar lives in a spacious, eight-room Manhattan apartment. Manhattan real estate has become more expensive, of course. But it's more than that. The words that kept going through my head as I was watching the movie were ""grown-up"" and ""intelligent."" Oscar, Felix, and their poker buddies are six white guys. They meet and play poker. There are no scenes where these adult, white men are revealed to be inept in comparison to women, blacks, or homosexuals. There are no scenes where the sassy gay man instructs the straight men on how to dress or create romance. There are no scenes where the ""magical negro"" shows the men that they can't dance. There are no scenes where a woman puts the men down for not knowing how to take care of children or shows the men up as being blinded by lust. There are no scenes where these straight, white men are made to apologize for being straight, white men. The men are grownups. They have jobs. They wear adult clothing. They wear white shirts and ties, slacks, belts, and shiny shoes. Oscar does wear a backwards baseball cap, but he is the clown of the group. And he does not wear it throughout the film. When he goes out, he dresses properly. They speak of their marriages as if marriage were something important. They speak of their children as if they love them. They go on dates. They ask women out, dress up for the occasion, and make witty banter with subtle double entendres. While watching ""The Odd Couple,"" I thought of recent Judd Apatow comedies starring men like Jason Segel, Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill. These current male stars all play children; they all play losers. They play failed men. The humor in these films is built around what pathetic creatures they are. In ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" Jason Segel, who is fat and prematurely saggy, is shown fully naked. The nakedness highlights his humiliation when his girlfriend, Sarah Marshall, dumps him. These films all use the F word over and over in a manner that feels desperate and limited. There is one very sly, very funny reference to the f word in ""The Odd Couple."" Oscar complains to Felix Unger that he is tired of getting little notes from Felix like ""We are all out of cornflakes. Signed, FU."" Oscar says it took him hours to figure out what ""FU"" meant. A funny joke. Delivered deliciously. The only time ""The Odd Couple"" has to refer to the F word to get a laugh. I've never felt, while watching a Judd Apatow comedy, that I was gaining any insight into the human condition. There are so many payoff moments of absurd comedy in ""The Odd Couple,"" as when Oscar steps on a vacuum cleaner cord and then takes his foot off the cord at just the right moment to send Felix reeling. But there were so many moments that made me say, ""Gosh, yes, that's what human relationships are like. That's what it's like to love/hate another human being.""I can't imagine a film like ""The Odd Couple"" being made today. A genuinely funny, intelligent, rich, grownup comedy about men that shines light on the human condition and that need never speak the F word to get a laugh. And I can't imagine anyone other than a Trump being able to afford that eight-room apartment in Manhattan.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDVhNzQxZDEtMzcyZC00ZDg1LWFkZDctOWYxZTY0ZmYzYjc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA0MDQ0Mjc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I was so looking forward to this as I really enjoyed the first one all those years ago and was interested in seeing where Jennifer Hills character ended up after the first movie. But whoah! I didn't expect this dross.I've no idea who this is even aimed at, it's not shocking or graphic, it's so badly written and poorly acted and is full of some of the most awful characters ever put onto film. Maria Olsen's character is so weird and over the top that she ruins every scene she's in. There's countless scenes where people just turn up at the right place and time to push the film onto the next scene, almost as if they have psychic powers and teleportation devices. (Oh look, our main protagonist just ran off into a massive forest and within seconds runs straight into the bad guys who are standing around at the exact spot for her to run into, what a coincidence)All the hicks in the film are depressingly over the top, idiotic and weird. The main heroines in the film do some of the most stupid things imaginable, it leaves you face palming yourself every few minutes, like seeing one of the villains coming towards you with a knife and despite you having a gun in your hand you........TURN YOUR BACK ON THEM AND START BANGING ON A DOOR, It's cringeworthy to sit through. Some of the dialogue in this abomination seems like it was written by a depressed crack smoking teen, seriously, you won't believe how bad some of the lines are. I spent half of the film cringing and wincing at some of the things the bad guys come out with.The main woman in this film is supposed to be the worlds no 1 supermodel who turns down half million dollar offers for fun, yet come on, while she's not a particularly unpleasant woman to look at, there's no way anyone who looks like her would be the worlds most famous model, they didn't even try to get someone stunning for the role. Even her hair and clothes suggest she's just an average woman, there's nothing glam about her whatsoever, so taking this serious is hard to do.The film rolls in at nearly TWO AND A HALF HOURS and there's a reason for this. Countless scenes of things that should last a few seconds like a character raking up leaves that go one for minutes at a time. Scenes of dialogue that just go on and on without ever adding to the story etc etcIf you found any joy in the 1978 film or any of the reboot trilogy, then avoid this one, it's woeful.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDg3MDE5ZGMtYjVkZi00MTJhLThkZDUtNjM0NWNlOWU3NTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA2MDcyNjE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Generally, they are so clichÃÂ©, bland, dumb and unrealistic that within the first 10 minutes of the film no one cares any longer about their fate. So when I saw early on in 'The Devil's Candy' that the main characters were a family of hippy bogans, I'll admit I was worried for the sake of the film. I make no mistake about the fact that these are not people I can relate to in any way, and have had almost universally negative experiences with them in my life. On the contrary though, that turned out to be the strongest element to the film. I loved this family. They were charming, caring, relatable and down to Earth. I genuinely cared about their fate, and that is a large part of what made 'The Devil's Candy' a very fine horror film.The second thing I loved about this film is that is never cheats. No scare is a false one. Nothing is suddenly revealed to be a dream sequence. No super-natural elements were required simply to make the story work. That is incredibly rare in the history of horror movies, let alone modern ones. Writer/director Sean Byrne needs to be absolutely commended on this. It is a brilliant effort on his part.There really isn't a lot of negatives I can come up with for this film. The only thing holding it back from being a '10' was an unforgettable ending. Other than that it is basically flawless. Fantastic acting, a simple yet brilliant and effective story, genuine scares that never cheat and characters that are both likable and relatable. In an industry that is seemingly completely lost as to how to make a good horror film, 'The Devil's Candy' needs to be studied by everyone in Hollywood. It is a very good film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQzOTIxNTA5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc3NzQ1MTI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The plot is simple but the film makes the most of it with inventive direction, a strong script, and an interesting ensemble cast, most of whom are very good. I believe that Tallulah Bankhead irritates many people but I thought she was effective enough and well cast.  I must say I was much more interested in Walter Slezak who played the Nazi and John Hodiak the tattooed tough guy. Both were excellent performances that really added to my enjoyment of the movie. Anybody who likes Hitchcock who hasn't seen 'Lifeboat' is in for a treat. Don't overlook this one.

If I've seen a film worse than this, it certainly doesn't spring to mind right now. I managed to get to the first screening in the local area and, even though the audience was fairly small, I still counted eleven people who walked out at various points in the movie and never came back. Now either Michael Myers slashed them up on their way to the lavatories or, like me, they were bored stiff by this absolute CLUNKER of a flick.The plot, or what little semblance there is of one, is simple yet completely ludicrous. An organisation called Dangertainment, headed by the entrepreneurial Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes), gets together a group of six students (!) to spend the night in serial killer Michael Myers' childhood home, in the hope that they will ""find clues"" as to what drove Myers to kill and kill again. Quite why, 25 years on from the murders, they think they will achieve anything by sending a group of teenagers into a house that, in the real world, would probably have long been demolished, is beyond me. Surely it is the job of police psychologists to dissect the minds of serial killers anyway? The film conveniently forgets the previous five sequels (with the exception of ""H20""; this gets an irrelevant reference in the gratuitous opening scenes which serve merely as an excuse to waste Jamie Lee Curtis' talents in some customary 'running around' antics) and throws us almost immediately into the environment of the house, where each of the six kids are given a little handy-cam to strap to their heads and told to go searching for clues... You with me so far? Well, that's pretty much all there is to it. Needless to say, Myers himself shows up at the house about 10 minutes into the movie (how? why?) and decides he wants to kill everybody one by one, in the style we've now become accustomed to.This paper-thin tale is told so badly, it's almost hard to believe what you're seeing on screen and that anyone was dumb enough to spend time and money filming it. I suppose you could almost see it like a series of noisy soundbites strung together randomly. It keeps things simplistic to the point of being nonsensical, presumably to avoid confusing its target audience of dribbling inbreds. I think I could've written a better, more entertaining and reasonable script myself on the back of a beermat. Nothing is ever explained or justified, no matter how implausible and ridiculous things get, and yet, bogglingly, the film still seems to take itself fairly seriously. It tries desperately to shock with a series of boring but bloody knife murders (nothing we haven't seen ad nauseam in any of the previous films) and innumerable 'false' scares with flashlights and toys falling out of cupboards. It's all so by-the-books and done-to-death that you'd have to have never seen a single horror film in your life to find it even remotely tense or scary.I think what bugs me the most about the film is just how terribly made it is. Even forgetting the GAPING plot holes, there are loads of obvious continuity errors and a sad, desperate style of direction that seems to drag every scene to the point of agony in a desperate attempt to pad out the already-short running time of the film. The cast do nothing to help things - all the characters are cardboard stereotypes and the ugly, plastic teens seem to be having a battle to see who can be the most skin-crawlingly irritating. I think it ends up as a tie between Katee Sachoff's hyperactive, squeaky airhead and Bianca Kajlich's jitterbug 'heroine', who spends the entire movie simpering and screaming loudly every time someone drops a pin. Oh, for the record, Busta Rhymes is absolutely ATROCIOUS in this. His entire purpose in this movie seems to be to deliver the worst examples of wisecrack-by-numbers dialogue I've ever heard (ie: ""Trick or treat, motherf**ker?"") and he plays his role as a cross between Eddie Murphy and Vin Diesel, but without the charm or charisma of either.I'd like to say John Carpenter would be ASHAMED to see such a horrible mess made out of his characters, but when you consider the maestro himself is making films almost as bad as this these days, he probably couldn't give a toss so long as the money keeps rolling in. I think this fact in itself proves just how much horror movies have changed since the first ""Halloween"" was made and, to its credit, ""Halloween Resurrection"" would be a perfect example of an ""of its time"" product you could stick in an 'early 21st century' time capsule for future generations to balk at. It is every bit as throwaway and pointless as the culture that spawned it. It is loud, crass and in-your-face constantly, despite having absolutely nothing to say when it gets there - it's like the movie equivalent of an annoying little brat screaming at you, desperate for attention. ""Look at me! Look at me! I'm being noisy and irritating!""... I would highly advise, for your sanity's sake, that you don't look since, like that annoying child, you'll only encourage it and I, for one, don't think I could cope with another sequel this bad... This film is utter garbage and I fail to think of a single way in which they could've made it any worse.

Very few ""important"" events happen in the film, but the degradation of the relation between the two main characters takes place little step by little step, and each dialogue is captivating, while the cast (all the cast) is wonderfully playing. Some scenes are surprising by their underneath violence (how a gift turns out to be an insult , and how the outrage is returned, is a flabbergasting sequence) The location in Anatolia, the winter atmosphere, and the remarkable photography adds a piece of charm to the film. At the end, you will remember that it all started by a little stone thrown at a car.... and wonder how you were so much immediately entrapped by the intrigue, so much that it could have lasted as long as the mother and the whore, another lengthy movie, you would not have complained.I do not want to spoil you by describing the plot, but it brings so many reflections about society, aging of a relationship, and a couple, that ... you will want to see it again (which I will certainly do when it is theater released in August).

It's a fight movie set in Sweetwater Prison in the Mohavje Desert, starring tough guys Wesley Snipes and Ving Rhames. What distinguishes this guy's movie are a couple things: the expert and lean direction of Hill, the crisp and intelligent script by David Giler and Hill, and one of the best boxing fight scenes ever done in the movies.Ving Rhames plays former undisputed Heavyweight Champion James ""Ice Man"" Chambers, convicted of rape and stripped of his title and sentenced to serve his time in Sweetwater. While there he learns that Monroe Hutchen (Wesley Snipes) is the ""undisputed"" champ at Sweetwater, and he has been undefeated champion for ten years. For the Ice Man, there can be only one champion, and that would be himself. It is predictable that the two will fight at the end, and this is arranged by mobster inmate Mendy Ripstein (a very good Peter Falk). What is not predicable is that Giler and Hill make both Ice Man and Monroe admirable and fascinating characters. You have to credit Rhames and Snipes. Rhames takes what could have been a Mike Tyson caricature, and transformed him into a complex and empathic character. His Ice Man is vicious, crude, arrogant, but also both smart and articulate. Credit Rhames on several occasions for scaring us with the ruthlessness of his Ice Man, and for also surprising us with his understanding of his stature in life as a Heavyweight champion. Ice Man is definitely the more showy character. Snipes underplays it right as Monroe, a great foil to the Ice Man. Snipes's Monroe is not afraid. Monroe knows that ""Any fighter can be beat on a given day..."", and the game is how long you stay on top and be the best. Monroe is matter of fact, and always in control-- the last time he wasn't got him in prison. Ice and Monroe are both convicts that operate by a code of honor, and that makes all the difference in the movie. It's all about standing your ground, and whoever wins, wins. ""Undisputed"" also is an homage to boxing and it's history, because ultimately it is about two men seeing who is better on that particular day. There is something pure and whole about that, which is both appreciated and respected.The final boxing match is awesome. Snipes is an accomplished martial artist and he trained with Emmanuel Stewart. Snipes looks amazing as a boxer-- body movement and combinations. Rhames also looks very impressive and fearsome. It's a 15 minute fight in a 90 minute movie. Walter Hill is the Man.""Undisputed"" is a no nonsense boxing movie that entertains and makes us think.

Critics gushed that SATANTANGO was without parallel - but two hours into the movie, I was less than impressed. Very little plot. Black and gray photography. Segments that went on seemingly forever, with no clear point. Much of the audience filed out early, and I left early, too. Was the director, Bela Tarr, trying to make the film an endurance contest? More recently, I consulted the Internet Movie Database to see what was written about SATANTANGO. The cumulative rating of 8.5 of 10 was impressive, as were the write-ups. ""A stunning experience,"" says one viewer. ""Biggest cinematic experience in history,"" says another. The kudos go on and on. But if you scroll down the database, you'll also find the negative reviews. ""Self- indulgent, annoying,"" one writer says. One of the more measured responses is, ""I do not regret that I saw this movie, but I certainly to not think it was a day well-spent"" - after giving the film a 1 of 10 rating. So, I decided to see the film again - this time on DVD - to determine if my initial dismissal at the PFA was warranted. And I learned how to appreciate a different kind of movie - and even come to enjoy it. My hints to a naive viewer:Calibrate your attention span. The individual takes of SATANTANGO are unusually long; the first scene, set outside a pen for steers and chickens, lasts over eight minutes, with no cuts. Just a single tracking shot. This happens through the entire film; in fact, the long takes and slow tracking shots give the film its rhythm and style. If you go into SATANTANGO expecting a film paced to contemporary standards, you'll be disappointed. If you can, take a few breaks between segments - and ask questions.Learn about recent European history. It's possible to enjoy SATANTANGO on its own merits, but understanding recent history helps greatly. The film dramatizes the economic depression that gripped the break-up of the Soviet blok, and things gone very bad, indeed. There's crumbling infrastructure everywhere. People struggle to get by, just barely, by depending on agricultural collectives (like the one depicted in SATANTANGO). This gray, depressing worldview would eventually engulf the region. Structure, structure, structure. The key to appreciating SATANTANGO lies in understanding the film's structure. Another reviewer here aptly mentioned Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON, wherein the film's narrative is defined by a single event - told in entirely different ways by the main characters. SATANTANGO uses a similar technique; several characters experience the same segment of time from different points of view. The eight-minute ""preface"" introduces us to the collective itself - where the barebones infrastructure is shown. From here, each segment of the film is separated by an inter-title; when a new segment starts, we see the same action - from a new character's POV. But nearly every segment involves leaving this wet, cold, impoverished piece of hell - or try to exploit it. Dance ""the Satantango."" The musical segments can open the way to appreciating and even enjoying SATANTANGO. Music is important for Tarr, and the repeating figures of dance are a metaphor. The tango is a repeating dance that abides by the rule, ""one step forward, two steps back."" It's reflected in the lives of the characters, who take one step forward in their lives, but always end up two steps back. The ""chapters"" of the film don't move forward like a typical narrative work; it repeats the same segment of time, over and over again. If you're frustrated by the fact that the movie seems static - that's the point. SATANTANGO is a story that can't move forward; it repeats the same familiar song, over and over - until a development determines a new course of action for the characters.I didn't enjoy SATANTANGO when I saw it the first time, but I've since become a fan. The investment of time may seem extreme to some, but it's more than worthwhile.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5MmFlZjYtYjliYS00OTk0LThiZmUtZWFhNDRjMDc2YWFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODU1OTc0MzI@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

"Ginger Snaps: Unleashed","2015.0","R","94.0","Horror, Thriller","6.4","","Brett Sullivan","Emily Perkins, Brendan Fletcher, Katharine Isabelle, Tatiana Maslany","15,246","Ginger's sister Brigitte, now a werewolf herself, must try to find a cure for her blood lust before the next full moon while hiding out in a rehab clinic from a relentless werewolf.","83","This isn't one of those diminishing returns.","Brigitte now has the virus in her blood that destroyed her sister Ginger in the first film. So to prevent herself from changing into the beast she injects monksblood into her system, but after an overdose she wakes up in a rehabilitation clinic. Which now she has become so attached to the syrup and without it, the affects of the curse starts to transform within her. From the physical to the mental attributes. But also on her tail is that of a male werewolf who wants to mate with her and Ginger is keeping a tab on her by haunting her mind. I remember when I picked up 'Ginger Snaps' I was expecting another mediocre or below-average werewolf flick. Gosh, I was wrong! Just like 'Dog Soldiers' it was more then good and added some new life to the whimpering sub-genre. And I'm happy to say it worked out again in this monstrous sequel and I was actually digging this one a tad more, though that was up until the stalling sequences involving hiding out in a house. It would've been great to see more Katharine Isabelle as Ginger too, but you can't have it all your own way I guess. I wasn't expecting anything incredibly special, but it did have big boots to fill and we all know the law of diminishing returns. Well, this sequel keeps far away form that trend and doesn't lean away from the quirky and offbeat nature of its predecessor, but it actually enhances it with a very morbid and cold-hearted appeal. It's depressing to the bone, I but I get kick out of any films that create this sort of tone! Though what made the original rejuvenating was that it had warm and natural relationships between the characters, especially between Bridget and Ginger, but also with the parents. Because of the sequel's depressing vibe, it does lack the heartache of the horrifying matter that drove the sisters even closer in the first film. Also it sorely does miss the characteristic interactions between the sisters. Although saying that they do share some screen time here, but only in small doses meaning far less impact. The plot is an absorbing one, which doesn't break a whole lot of new ground like the original, but still comes up with enough hunger to set it out from most other horror flicks of the last decade, but also adding another dimension to the tale. Just like in the first film and like many reviewers have painted it's a metaphor for adolescent life, from angst, drugs and sex. But this cocktail is mixed with a refreshing twist involving the werewolf mythology, introducing the metaphor part of all of this. The snappy script holds up well and the story moves along pretty quickly with enough excitement initiated and the twists are far from easy to detect. No way is this story's structure predictable! The actual ending was kind of clever, but felt odd and left me feeling a little unsatisfied. The editing was swiftly sharp and potent to the pacing. It also recaptures the slickly handled production of that of the original, but it looks like it had more to work with here. That's especially because the special effects and werewolf designs were vastly better this time around and the attacks were more callous and bloodier. The isolated setting was made to great use with its cold wintry backdrop and gloomy awe. The action might have up the ante in this sequel, but so did the soundtrack by igniting itself with the Gothic and haunting tunes that made the original great. The upbeat tempo of the soundtrack bounds the mood. The spectral sound effects also worked its way into the picture and it was hard to shut out its thumping vibration throughout. The out-and-out stylistic camera-work sinuously develops some inventive shots. The direction by Brett Sullivan is above par and he hones down his skills with preciseness but adding such tautness and tension to the picture. The performances were magnificent. Emily Perkins comes out of the shadow of Katharine Isabelle here, and she made the most of it by turning in a convincing performance. Tatiana Maslany as Ghost one of the kids in the clinic provides on the humour side of things and Eric Johnson is perfectly scummy as one of the workers at the clinic. Katharine Isabelle makes some small but yet effective glimpses and adds in with some voice-overs. This production most definitely went one step bigger.After two worthy werewolf films, I wonder if the film makers can repeat this winning formula in their third flick of the series Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning (2004) or will it come crashing back to earth with a thud. The sequel is very much on par with the original and definitely well worth the look. Actually I would say it's a must-see if you seen the original.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1MTIxMTc0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTIxMjUyMQ@@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The experience is profoundly rewarding, causing the intelligent viewer to make diverse reflexions over the meaning of life itself. With 'Mar Adentro' Alejandro AmenÃÂ¡bar has surpassed the best he has done to date, and even redeemed certain deviations in his earlier films which smacked a little of being aimed at Hollywood. This is not the case with this visual poem put to music: Hollywood could never get anywhere near the effect of this tinglingly inspired human - and humane - story.In no way should one interpret 'Mar Adentro' as an apologia for euthanasia; this story, based on the real life of the Galician fisherman RamÃÂ³n Sampedro, is a cry from the bottom of the heart for life and love, a reaching out for human compassion, for understanding emotions. Sampedro was an articulate and intelligent man who after a diving accident off the rocks of the Galician coast as a young man was condemned to live the next 27 years in bed. 'Condenado a vivir' (2001) (TV) was the first version of this man's life on which I have already commented. However, AmenÃÂ¡bar has succeeded remarkably at portraying this man, with his permanent enigmatic smile and witty sense of humour, in an equally articulate and intelligent way.And Javier Bardem rose to the occasion, met the challenge head-on, complete with a Galician accent, producing an electrifying, compelling, enthralling performance, such that the actor and the fisherman become fused into being the same person on screen. Here, indeed, is an occasion to doff your cap, and softly mutter 'chapeau'. Bardem is driven on in his task by a magnificent cast, especially BelÃÂ©n Rueda, Lola DueÃÂ±as, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo (Los Lunes al Sol) (qv) and Clara Segura, Galician and Catalan accents taking prominent part. AmenÃÂ¡bar produces wonderful dialogues as these six rotate among themselves one-on-one, or in groups, with excellent chemistry, thus demonstrating that this young Chilean-born Spanish director is an artist who knows what he is at and how to get his results; his global concept of the film includes his own music, interspersed with pieces by Beethoven and Puccini on Sampedro's record-player.Whilst viewing 'Mar Adentro', I found myself a couple of times comparing him and this film with Stephen Daldry and his masterpiece 'The Hours' (qv). I refer to the way in which the dialogues work with tenseness and passion and that careful sense of timing in each scene.Javier Aguirresarobe's photography is superb as usual. As I have mentioned elsewhere on IMDb, he does not simply film the events and scenes - he captures even the feelings and the atmosphere of the moment, deftly catches that look in the eyes, light and shadows, such that his work behind the camera is at once another player in the story. A superb artist.'Mar Adentro' is another landmark in the history of Spanish cinematography, among the best five or six works of art produced here in the last 25 years. This film places itself alongside such cinematographic art as 'El Sur' (qv), 'Los Santos Inocentes' (qv), 'El Abuelo' (qv), 'La Lengua de las Mariposas' (qv), 'Las Ratas' (qv), 'A Los Que Aman' (qv), and I think I must add 'Te Doy Mis Ojos' (qv).Superbly orchestrated story of a real man, and those who loved him around his bedside: not to be missed.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDk2NjgwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTgyMzA3._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Intelligent, tense and effective.","When I hear mention of Warren Beatty these days I almost begin to snore, but before Beatty became a boring old fart he made a handful of very interesting and adventurous movies like 'Mickey One', 'McCabe & Mrs Miller' and 'The Parallax View', hardly safe Hollywood movie star material. 'The Parallax View' is THE definitive 1970s paranoid thriller, beaten only by Coppola's 'The Conversation', released incidentally the same year. The movie has to be watched in the context of when it was made. It's shot through with post-Watergate cynicism and the Kennedy assassinations cast a long shadow over the plot. Beatty gives a very subtle, relaxed performance, and for me is totally believable. The supporting cast is first rate. Veteran Hume Cronyn ('Shadow Of A Doubt') plays Beatty's editor, Paula Prentiss ('The Stepford Wives') a hysterical fellow journalist, and William Daniels (Dustin Hoffman's father in 'The Graduate') has a brief but memorable bit as another witness who fears for his life. Also keep an eye out for the legendary Bill McKinney (who nobody who's ever seen 'Deliverance' will forget!) as an assassin, Anthony Zerbe ('The Omega Man') as a psychologist (playing Pong with a chimp!), and Earl Hindman ('The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three') in the bar fight scene. Much of 'The Parallax View' was later used in 'Arlington Road', an unconvincing movie which was much too contrived for me to be believable. It just didn't have the subtlety that this one has, and spelled everything out, seeming assuming its audience wasn't bright enough to get it. 'The Parallax View' is still one of the most intelligent, tense and effective conspiracy thrillers ever made, and the direction by the late Alan J. Pakula is just about flawless. Highly recommended.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzljZDcyNGEtYWMyOC00MTJmLTljMzEtYmJiZjY1NDA1ZDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The four pre-Zombi 2 Giallo films that Fulci made prove this, and there's enough other gems dotted throughout the man's filmography that go a long way towards proving it further; The Devil's Honey being one of them. This is a surprisingly restrained film considering the more famous Fulci flicks, although the lack of gore is somewhat made up for in nudity; as this film is certainly not short on that front. The first twenty minutes aren't a far cry away from being a porn film, and it's not until the first plot point that we realise Fulci does have actually have a story to tell. The plot follows a young man who has an accident (which is completely his own fault) and ends up on the operating table of Doctor Simpson, a man tormented by his nagging wife and questionable manhood. After the young man dies, poor old Doctor Simpson begins receiving irritating phone calls from a woman repeatedly asking why he let the man die. Before long, he finds himself the captive of the vindictive female.It has to be said that the story plays out well, and while it's not exactly plot heavy; Fulci does a good job of keeping the sexual tension high, and that is highly beneficial since it's the main point of the movie. The film is bound to appeal to sadists and feminists alike, as much of the movie features the young women exacting her revenge on the man she blames for the death of her lover. The main intrigue comes from the relationship between the two leads, as although their acquaintance is based on hatred; they soon develop a perverse love for one another. Perhaps the most surprising thing about this film is the fact that the love doesn't come across as contrived! Fulci sets up the characters so well that it's easy to see how and why this relationship transpires as it does. The only real problem with the film is that Fulci spends a little too much time with flashbacks between the girl and her dead lover, and this takes the focus away from the girl and the doctor, which should always be kept at the forefront of the film. However, The Devil's Honey works well in spite of that and overall this little thriller is well worth seeking out! I'd also like to give a quick mention to the poem that the movie takes its title from, as like the rest of the film - it's rather good!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWFjNjBiNWUtZjFlZi00ZDM3LTljMDAtNTZjY2JiMGE0ZjhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Her journey takes her to a strange Californian seaside town governed by a mysterious undead cult.","106","Mesmerizing horror film!","DEAD PEOPLE (or MESSIAH OF EVIL) is one of those rare horror films that comes along only a few instances in one's lifetime. I had heard about it years ago but never sought it, mostly because of the really bad reviews it got (Michael Weldon says it's crap in his Psychotronic book) but after deciding to check it out and paying only 4 bucks for the DVD, I have to say that all those naysayers were wrong. Really wrong.I was totally knocked-out by this forgotten film. Everything about it is mesmerizing. The thing I was impressed the most about DEAD PEOPLE is the mood. I've rarely seen a horror this darkly moody, not since SUSPIRIA. Horror fans looking for gore or fast paced action or even the standard way horror films are usually made (high body count, an unstoppable killer, etc) will be disappointed by DEAD PEOPLE. It's none of those things.DEAD PEOPLE is directed like a nightmare and everything about it is disorienting. There's almost no familiar point of reference in the movie. Everything about it is deliberately done as to make the viewers feel like they cannot relate to what's going on, which is probably why this film looks like a failure to many. But for me, the effect is fantastic. This ""disorientating"" technique is very common now, with celebrated filmmakers, such as David Lynch, who have made entire careers utilizing this style of film-making. Take the threesome for instance, played by Michael Greer, Joy Bang and the luscious Anitra Ford. When was the last time you saw a threesome in a horror film? This threesome could have easily been used to titillate fans of horror or exploitation films but it is shown matter-of-factly and yet, to most people, a threesome is still not something they're comfortable with. The ""matter-of-fact"" way the threesome is portrayed might indicate to many that their characters are poorly written when it's the opposite. The fact that the movie never delves into the most salacious aspects of a threesome tells me more about what the filmmakers believed was important to the story than anything else.But these incidental, disorienting aspects of the story do not even begin to explain the non-clichÃÂ©d horror aspects of DEAD PEOPLE, which can only be described as beautiful. Something horrific is going on in town. People are turning into ""dead people"", not because they were bitten by a vampire or a zombie, but because of some unseen force. The creeping terror that occurs in DP is not that different than what happens in something like THE BIRDS or INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, sans cold war paranoia. Thanks to the spooky voice overs, one from the daughter and one from the father, we learn that the unseen force affect people through the mind or soul (the father, who's an artist, is aware of this unseen force and it affects his art. Brilliant!) Comparing DEAD PEOPLE to other films is sorta a disservice because this is a totally original film. Unlike so many horror movies, the horror elements in DEAD PEOPLE are not used by the filmmakers to ""punish"" the characters but to create a nightmarish world, which oddly enough, because of the subtle way the creeping terror unfolds, makes the movie look more real than real.The acting from everyone rangs from OK to pretty good, with Michael Greer being a revelation. He has a very commanding presence. It's a shame his film career never amounted to much. And Anitra Ford is ridiculously hot. I've rarely seen such a sensuous woman in movies. Again, it's a shame her career went nowhere. The music is low key but effective. The cinematography is excellent. The amazing use of depth of field enhances the nightmarish goings on. The only thing that's bad is the song at the end. It just doesn't fit the rest of the movie.For a film that's supposed to be bad, there are several stand-out scenes in it. About 6 or 7. That's a lot! Most have already mentioned those stand-out scenes here (at the supermarket and cinema) but there are others: at the beginning, at the gas station. When the daughter finds her father's notes. Joy Bang looking at the paintings when getting ready to sleep. The scene when the cops start shooting at people. And the dead people crashing though skylight. The sound effects are a little weak during that scene but the whole moment is still powerful.I hope one day this film will be completely restored and maybe be re-released on the big screen, which would rock. If your a fan of horror and love atmospheric, moody, nightmarish horror films make sure to check out DEAD PEOPLE. It's simply mesmerizing!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWY3MDc1NDAtMWY0Yy00NDNlLTljZjItOWNmZDRmMGVhZmY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzU4ODM5Nw@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Ranging from the ones in a journalistic style to the short and tear-jerking. That's the way to do it, Disney. As for the movie, it is terrible. Disney is dead. The people who now control the corporation have nothing in common with its founder. Walt Disney had a vision, his movies had a soul. ""Disney"" today has only calculation, with movies made of plastic.For example: Who in his right mind would give a movie aimed at kids the tag-line ""Mom needs a little space.""? It means that children's' mothers want to get away from them. Is this heartwarming? Is it truly what children should hear? Or is it just something a movie producer thinks is a clever play on words? Few parents will pay to see a movie with a tag-line that insults them.The characters look freaky. Aliens with bloated heads that would make their tiny necks snap are not a welcome sight. The anteater-like ""Wingnut"" character is outright disturbing. I am reminded of the creepy Australian children's show ""Dirtgirlworld"". (If you want to be freaked out, look it up in YouTube.) At the end you have to wonder where the people went who could make Lady and the Tramp and put true feeling in it, with way less technology than today. Now we get do-it-by-the-numbers productions: ""Let's find a Heartwarming Subject. Let's throw in Funny Sidekicks (loved that Jar-Jar Binks). Let's have a Mean Enemy Boss. Give him a mean name too. In the end the kid Saves The Day. With lots of special effects."" What could go wrong? You did it by the numbers, right? Took it from A to Z. Why doesn't it work? Like when you survey people about what they like to see on a car, and put it all together to make the perfect vehicle. How could it be a flop? (It was, it's a marketing disaster classic.) Or when you hire a decorator to decorate an apartment in an ""eclectic"" style, choosing only the most expensive parts and the most appreciated objects in the catalogue. How could it be awful? Or when you go to the gym and pump up your muscles, targeting exactly those muscle groups that people are said to look at the most. How could people think you look fake?

Unfortunately, it's so utterly, astonishingly preposterous that enjoyment was impossible. ""The Toxic Avenger"" is more plausible and well-reasoned than this.The main character almost immediately suffers a horrible symptom that would have any sensible woman dialing 911, but she opts to work a shift at a restaurant instead. I'll grant the filmmakers that maybe her disease is dialing up her stupidity, but 30 minutes in, her outward appearance is horrifying - the makeup effects are the sole redeeming element - and none of the other characters seem to notice, despite the fact that these same characters made a point to tell her how horrible she looked 10 minutes earlier, when she had no outwardly visible symptoms. Then again, a trip to the ER, rather than to a doctor whose STD exam doesn't require the patient to remove her jeans, would have ended the movie 15 minutes in.Worst of all, the director is too cowardly to really go for the gross- out, other than the opening shot and one well-executed shot near the midpoint. Every other opportunity to make the movie truly horrifying is fumbled. For example, the medical exam could've been a terrifying ""Dead Ringers""-esque nightmare, but instead it was just stultifying nonsense.I would like to say that it's so bad it's good, but it is most decidedly not. The ability to elicit laughter might have made it passable, but instead it only elicits groans. I'm happy that the filmmakers were able to sell this dreck to some apparently rohypnol-addled exec at IFC, but they've already been paid. There's no reason to feel obligated to spend money on this mess. It'll be streaming soon enough. Skip it, unless you want to spend an evening going, ""Seriously?!?"" and ""Really?!?"" for 85 minutes.

A perfect biographical film.","Biographical films that are done right can be a thing of beauty.  They can enlighten us by giving us perspective and insight into people that we may recognize by name but yet know little of the circumstances that have made up the fabric of their lives.  And if the life they led is as fascinating as that of Loretta Lynn, they can also entertain us in the process.Based on Lynn's autobiographical novel of the same name, Coal Miner's Daughter is easily one of the best films of this genre.  It is the story of how Loretta Lynn became one of the most successful Country & Western vocalists in recording history despite having been raised in the poverty stricken hills of Butcher Holler, Kentucky, marrying at the age of 13, and having several children to boot.The first half of Coal Miner's Daughter is a fascinating look at a life foreign to most of us.  As the daughter of Ted Webb (Levon Helm) and Clara Webb (Phyllis Boyens), Loretta (Sissy Spacek)seems destined to live her life just as all who those who live in Butcher Holler eke out an existence.  It seems predetermined that she will probably marry one day, that her husband will be a coal miner just as her own father is, and she will have a caboodle of young 'uns running around the hills barefoot.  One day, on a trip into town with her father, Loretta meets the irrepressible Mooney Lynn (Tommy Lee Jones) who has just come home form the service.  It isn't long before Mooney convinces the 13 year. old Loretta that they are in love and need to be married.  After convincing Ted and Clara to give their blessing, the wedding takes place, and although it isn't apparent for many years, it's a decision that will forever alter the course of her existence.One of the reasons this film succeeds on the level that it does, is because Director Michael Apted never falls into the trap of making the film judgmental about many  of the events that occur in Loretta's life.  He let's the events of the film unfold naturally, and we either accept them for what they are or we don't.  For instance, many Directors would have felt the need to implant some nefarious motive behind Mooney's relationship with Loretta. The events that happen in Loretta's childhood were what they were, and though letting a child of thirteen marry may be foreign to us, it was obviously something that may not have been extraordinary unusual back in Butcher Holler.There is another reason why Coal Miner's Daughter succeeds on all levels. Sissy Spacek plays Loretta Lynn as if she were cloned from her.  Not only is their resemblance strikingly uncanny, her speaking voice, her singing voice, her mannerisms will have you believing that it is Loretta herself starring in this film.  As if this isn't enough, Spacek was required to play a character that starts out as a naive thirteen year old girl, and ends as an adult woman who suffers through many painful and tumultuous events in her life.  Not an easy task at all, but it is the stuff for which actresses win Academy Awards, and Spacek certainly earned hers.If Spacek's performance was exceptional, the rest of the cast would merely need to be adequate to make the film succeed, but they are every bit as impressive.  Given the difficult role of playing Mooney, Tommy Lee Jones brings the character to life.  While never making Mooney appear sympathetic, he does show us that Mooney is after all a human being, subject to the same foibles and temptations as the rest of us.  Most of all, despite his failings, Jones lets us know that Mooney did indeed care a great deal for Loretta, even if such outward expressions of love were foreign to him.There's more.  Levon Helm as Ted Webb gives one of the best supporting performance ever in a film.  As Ted, he gives us a father who cares deeply about his family, doing for them what he can with what little money he can scrape by on from his earning.  He is a man who has obviously been beaten down by the drudgery and day to day existence of spending most of his life with a pick and a shovel mining coal.  It is this existence that eventually forces Mooney into his decision to not become a victim of the coal mines.Last but certainly not least, is Beverly D'Angelo as Patsy Cline, who not only befriends Loretta, but helps to teach her the ways of the world.  Her performance is so good in fact, that although her scenes aren't many, D'Angelo leaves an indelible mark that made it difficult to accept Jessica Lange in the same role.  I do not know why Jones, Helm, and D'Angelo were not recognized when Awards time rolled around as they were all at least deserving of a nomination if not a win.  Perhaps Spacek's performance was so powerful that it overshadowed the fine work done by the rest of the cast. Then again, I quit trying to figure the reasoning behind awards a long time ago.There is no doubt however, that Coal Miner's Daughter is one of the best biographical films ever.  It is one of those rare times when cast, director, writer, all came together to make a very special film.  And when they all do that I have no choice but to give them my grade which for Coal Miner's Daughter is an A+.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRjZTQ1NjYtODI2NC00ZTUwLTg3OGMtOTRkYTkxNzA5YmQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcwOTQzOTYy._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

For some reason, they titled this movie as if it were a sequel.  When Jackie decided to make this movie, he was being greatly influenced by the smash hit ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" and wanted to make a movie in that adventure style.  This movie could have been really, really great if it had been made entirely the way Jackie had it envisioned at the start of production.  The movie has a great beginning, and then it is destroyed by an agonizing slow middle, and then it picks up again with an action packed ending.  The reason the movie has that horrible middle is because of the stunt that went wrong at the beginning of the film.  As all Jackie fans know, this is the film that almost killed Chan.  In the beginning action sequence, he does this awesome chase scene where he is bounding across the walls of a castle. In the first take, Jackie actually made it across.  But being a perfectionist, he tried for a second take.  The first take partially broke the branch of the tree he jumps on, and on the second take, the branch broke completely, sending Jackie crashing to the ground and busting his head on a rock. I am mentioning all this because this is the reason the middle of the movie is so slow.  Production could only be halted for a short time.  They could not wait until Jackie had fully recovered.  So, as soon as he was able to get out of bed, they re-wrote the middle part of the movie to exclude all the eye-popping stunts that Jackie had originally planned.  They continued filming this lame, muddled attempt at a romance plot until Jackie was more healed.  Once Jackie was back to 100 percent, they started filming the movie the way they had originally intended:  with amazing stunts and incredible action choreography.  The end of the movie picks up with Jackie, his side kick, and the love interest, infiltrating a castle run by monks, and they try to steal a treasure guarded by fiesty amazon women who wear lots of '80s style makeup.  As ridiculous as that all sounds, the fight scenes at the end are among the best that Jackie has ever done.  Its really amazing and a lot of fun to watch just for the choreography aspect.  Check out one of the hardest hits I have ever seen, when one of the amazons comes flying at Jackie from about 8 feet in the air, he kicks her in mid flight, and she spins completely around and slams HEAD FIRST in to the dirt!  I don't care if there was a stunt pad there, it is a HARD LANDING!  OUCH!  There is no way the stunt person walked away from that unharmed.  The second movie ""OPERATION CONDOR"" was a lot better as a whole.  That is one of my all time favorite Jackie Chan films, and I still watch it over and over again.  But PART 2 (the first of the films) is definitely a must-see (despite the confusing title).  My recommendation is this:  Get the movie, watch the first part until he escapes from the natives, then FAST FORWARD through the entiremiddle, DO NOT BOTHER to watch it, it is totally irrelevant, and start watching again as they infiltrate the castle.  You wont be sorry.  Don't believe all the other bad reviews about this film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGZkZjZjOTItNDZkOS00MDY1LWE5MGUtNjMyMTJjZmM5ZTlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

BUT, in spite of Baldwin's ineptness, it actually turned out to be a very good film. I would go see it again and I would take my family to see it (if they edited out the bedroom scene). BOTTOM LINE: It's a wonderful and classic story with a wonderful cast and somehow this film has been able to overcome all of the obstacles that stood in its way.

Roger Ebert gave it four out of four, and along with ""Angel Heart,"" it helped solidify 1987 as the Year of Mickey Rourke.However, almost twenty years later it isn't talked so much about anymore, and I feel it deserves to be. Rourke gives one of his finest performances as Henry, a loner who walks hunched over like the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Henry works at a bar as a runner - delivering orders and such. But he's always getting into drunken brawls with the bartender, usually losing.One day Henry's life takes a turn when he meets a downtrodden woman (Faye Dunaway) and they embark on a relationship.""Barfly"" is a great film. Rourke was vocal later on in his career about his dislike of director Barbet Schroeder, but Schroeder's direction is part of what makes this film so good.However, the absolute best aspect of the movie is Rourke's performance. Embodying the late writer Charles Bukowski (whose work this was based upon, and who had a brief cameo in the film), Rourke is unrecognizable - like Billy Bob Thornton in ""Sling Blade,"" his entire demeanor and physicality seems to change.I highly recommend ""Barfly"" - it's funny, dark, witty, touching and downright enjoyable.

Demi Moore's curious Scarlet Letter is almost an hour underway before it even reaches the point where Hawthorne's book begins: whereas Hawthorne's novel is a study of sin, psychological torment, and forgiveness, this film has neither heart nor mind behind its high-gloss presentation: it is apparently a libertine tract in defense of adultery, and an attack, pretentiously lofty but incapable of more than junior-high subtlety of thought, on intolerance. This can only be pulled off at all by systematically reducing Hawthorne's three-dimensional characters to flat and dull-witted markers, inane in their dialogue, a set of manic and breathy artifacts of a soap-opera sensibility. Accordingly, the characters of Hester Prynne (Moore) and her erstwhile husband Roger Chillingworth (Robert Duvall) emerge as parodies of themselves -- bad acting and bad direction across the board by one bad actress and one good actor.  Gary Oldman's Arthur Dimmesdale is astoundingly more or less credible for whole scenes at a time, but he has nothing to play against, and the thematic underpinnings of the story have been knocked out from under him.  One can defend this film for its cinematography, for its score, and for any number of other production-based virtues, but when they are all added together, they still don't come close to justifying the film's existence.  It is a vulgar and banal demolition of one of America's greatest novels.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxOWQ0OWMtY2E5YS00YjkzLWFjODQtZGY4NTQ5YmE2OGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The trip started by Raimund is not between places but between identities. An existential journey into the great unknown of the soul. Some say we take ourselves everywhere we go. This movie tries to tell us instead that we *find* ourselves in those places, we discover a new way of seeing with our own eyes and, when we leave, a part of us stays in that place forever. Returning there is a way of visiting ourselves, like we would an old friend... There's so many layers, so many subtle metaphors, so much poetry in the imagery and storytelling, that despite being such a straightforward story you can't help feeling like you're walking through a maze, a labyrinth of emotions and thoughts, where present, past and future merge into a vast uplifting eternity. One of the best crafted uses of mise-en-abÃÂ®me i recall ever seeing in a movie! Raimund is Raimund, but he's also Pascal Mercier, and also Amadeu Prado and also You. There's a fiction within a fiction here: a book within a book within a movie. A lie within a lie: a poet within a reader, within a spectator, within a person. This dilution between fiction and reality and between the actor and the audience often occurs, but rarely is it ever a theme, rarely is it ever presented as a question to the audience and rarely so beautifully answered. This game of mirrors will leave you full of wonder and hungry for life. There couldn't be a better outcome for a story that starts with a suicide attempt... There's too many reasons to watch this movie and too little space to review it properly unfortunately... The scenery of Lisbon, the universal anguish of the characters, the excruciating portrayal of the Portuguese dictatorship, the lessons it offers on some of the most important questions one can ask oneself... Do yourself a favor and go see it!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE5OTkxNzMxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQ4NjY3MDE@._V1_UY209_CR5,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This movie's got it all: great music, great animation (far better than ""Heavy Metal"", a similar film, which was released around the same time), and a storyline that appeals to a more mature mindset. If you think of animation as two categories -- anime or ""Care Bears"" style kid stuff -- this doesn't belong in either. It's a uniquely American animation style. And the music! Debby Harry, Iggy Pop, Mick Jagger, Earth Wind & Fire, it goes on and on, a constant stream of music that not only doesn't distract, but is a complement to what's going on on screen. The songs have aged very well in the past 30 years. This movie's a musical, but its music flows naturally, without those ""And now I must stop everything and sing!"" moments that make musicals so tedious. The special effects are also amazing, the more so when you consider when this movie was made.I was one of the people who wrote Nelvana, and then Unearthed, begging for this re-release, and I was one of the first to order the set.

One needn't know much more going in to be assured that this will be an enjoyable film.  Together they take on the Washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a naÃÂ¯ve Washington outsider who gets appointed to the Senate and stands alone against corruption and graft.  Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed from an unnamed state after one of its Senators dies.  He is appointed because the political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony, but who will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will make bigwig Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) millions.  When the wide eyed Smith gets to Washington, he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a children's camp.  When he tries to stop the project, Taylor's political machine frames him to make it seem like he is the one taking graft.  This leads to the dramatic confrontation in the Senate, where Smith filibusters in an attempt to get the truth out.This film is wonderful in so many ways.  The story is a classic struggle between good and evil.  In typical Capra style, the protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  If there is one clear message in Capra's films it is that those with strong moral fiber never give up hope.  He likes to create utterly hopeless situations for characters to test their integrity, and rewards unswerving adherence to basic values and principles by triumph against the odds.  I was dismayed to see a comment, obviously from a young viewer of this film, that said that the characters weren't realistic because no one used profanity.  This is a sad testimonial to our culture, when it inconceivable to young people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not the rule. Stewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of Washington, with its monuments and history.  The story brings us a confrontation between political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the truly great men are the ones that don't compromise their principles to hold on to power.  Stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the part.Jean Arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by Washington politics, but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to Smith's noble homespun philosophies.  Claude Rains is also masterful as the adulterated Senator, who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the presidency.  He plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a torment that is clearly ripping his heart out, and the power of both emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant and pitiable.This film is a national treasure.  It is in my top 50 list of all time.  The story of corruption in politics and the greatness of the men who resist it is timeless and would not be lost on the politicians in Washington today.

"The Rain People","1992.0","","101.0","Drama","6.8","66.0","Francis Ford Coppola","James Caan, Shirley Knight, Robert Duvall, Marya Zimmet","3,991","When a housewife finds out she is pregnant, she runs out of town looking for freedom to reevaluate her life decisions.","33","one of the sleepers of the late sixties, with (good) experimental ideals for a drama","In some scenes in the Rain People, Francis Ford Coppola's precursor to his hey-day of the seventies, there is the mark of a similar situation to 1969's Easy Rider, but not exactly in the same reference frame. Here we have a drama about disconnected people from society, in some ways alienated by the choices or by limits imposed by one mean or another. It's one of those rare original dramas where some scenes stand alone as total knockouts. Even with such a low-string budget and a very freewheeling, so to speak, attitude about filming the movie, Coppola is able to capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters and the curved, unexpected degrees of one character versus the helplessness of another, or vice versa, or both. And, as one might be inclined seeing as how it is very much about the cutaways of suburban life of the 1960s, it has that escapism of the film mentioned before, but of a more concrete, near timeless quality with the drama and the underlying issues. In a way, if Bergman were on route as a quasi-guerrilla 20-something filmmaker out to get the strange truths of everyday outsiders, this might be it.But along with all of the very direct and sometimes self-conscious photography (though also with a more documentary approach at times, akin with its indeterminable characters), the actors all fit into place. Shirley Knight, an actress I'm not too familiar with, has a complex, diverging role as a pregnant wife running off in a sort of existentialist conundrum of what life is there to have. There are moments of some awe-inspiring acting by her, and one of my favorites (if not my favorite) is when she is on the telephone calling her husband the first time. Such a tense scene on both ends, and in every small gesture and inflection of a word so much about her is spoken with so little. It's extraordinary in ways that mirror others in Coppola's films. Then comes in the character of 'killer' played by James Caan. This, too, is a dangerous character to take on, as it is a mix of childish bewilderment and amusement with scarred memories. Think Forrest Gump if he didn't make it past the football and wit. It's one of his best, actually, by being the most minimalist- for a guy who's usually playing tough guys in movies, here's one that also is part of the crux of the story and of Knight's character. Also very good in a supporting role is Robert Duvall as a cop with a rough side and rather checkered past; kind of an early sample of other defected characters he would play later on in his career.So the characters, and what Coppola risks in having an uneasiness running in them, are really what make up the film, as whatever story there is it is definitely not resolved in the usual way you might think or expect. The last ten or so minutes are like others in Coppola's work, where the specific tragedies on all sides are undercut by the emotional- and psychological- implications this will leave on the principles are amplified to the sublime and sad. This is, for its time, brave on the part of what is trying to be represented (in both the freedom as well as the flaws and ambiguities) in the subject matter. And the style of the picture adds a fragmented kind of view onto it all with quick flashbacks that are graphic and self-contained in a contrast with the longer shots in some crucial scenes.

""What's that all about?"" he asked me. What could I say? I replied, ""You just had to have lived through those times to understand and appreciate the movie."" The same can be said of ""The Wild One."" Before ""Blackboard Jungle,"" before ""Rebel Without A Cause,"" before ""Look Back in Anger,"" there was ""The Wild One."" ""What are you rebelling against?"" ""Whatcha got?"" That certainly sounds like James Dean in ""Rebel Without a Cause"" but, no, it's Johnny (Brando) in ""The Wild One."" I saw this movie for the first time when I was 13 and was mesmerized by it. Apparently it was distributed again after ""Blackboard Jungle"" and ""Rebel Without a Cause"" came out because I saw it the same year I saw the other two. As far as fascination of the three, this one effected me most. Almost as good as Brando is Lee Marvin. I've read conflicting accounts of how The Beatles came up with their name. One, they so admired Buddy Holly and the Crickets that they adopted Beatles as a replacement for Crickets. The other story is that John Lennon so admired ""The Wild One"" that he took the name of the rival bikers and gave it a new spelling. Whatever the case, Lee Marvin is a good foil for Brando.My favorite part of the movie is the opening. The open highway is a symbol for the movie. The highway is a means of passage for new ideas, new challenges, new life styles. The highway can bring evil as well as good. It is symbolic of freedom and a carefree way of life. It's not surprising that trucks began replacing freight trains as the major means of transport for goods and services following World War II. The highway also began replacing the rails as the major means of escape for the socially and spiritually oppressed among us. The viewer sees the blacktop for what seems to be several minutes. Suddenly, something appears on the horizon. Before the viewer knows it, rebels in the form of bikers are headed directly toward the camera. Then it seems they actually run through the camera and come out of the screen into the audience. What a piece of cinematography. Hungarian-born Laszlo Benedek mainly concentrated on television after this film. Being such a gifted director, one wishes he had done more films.There is actually not much of a story in this movie. Supposedly based on a true account of a biker gang taking possession of a small California town, it's mainly a comment on changing times and mores in post-war America. But from the first roar of bikes journeying down the pavement, the viewer is hooked and stays spellbound to the very end. One thing puzzles me about the film's history: How does a movie get banned in Finland?","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjJlNGRkMzItOGM5Yi00Njc1LTg5NWYtMDVjM2VkYWY3OGVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Well, they have a funny notion of ""hard-hitting,"" since Strobel's book basically packages the essays of thirteenÃÂ Christian academics, mostly from theological institutions. That's the sum of his ""hard-hitting"" research--letting readers be evangelized by believers.

By the means of having a great fun time at the movie-theatre.So if you are mostly to Hollywood-Popcorn-Horror-Flics and that's exactly what you expect of a good movie, do yourself a favor and don't watch CALVAIRE.If you like European Art-house Cinema and are also devoted to real rough and downbeating horror movies, you should have a closer look at this interestingly done work of Fabrice Du Welz.The young director puts the viewer always in the middle of what is shown on the screen. The beautiful photographed frames are supported through the high grained film material. It nearly looks like a dokumentary, but without the handhold camera style. No bright colours have been used, the colours even look washed out, slightly fading into grey. So the look is very authentic. The Settings are all natural. There is no artificial studio-stage touch in this movie. No additional lightning seems to be added. This style helps the movie to draw the audience perfect into it. Shot on an aspect ratio of 2.35 : 1, this movie is a real cineatic feast when taking part in a movie theatre presentation. Its frames stand for themselves. The power of the pictures (like paintings) speak a more clearly language than every average dialogue in a Hollywood production does. This is cineastic story telling at its best. I also liked the extremely slow pasted development of the story.The movie's start-off could be made by FRANCOIS TRUFFAUT. Even the protagonist, Marc Stevens (played by LAURENT LUCAS) reminded me a bit of JEAN PIERRE LEAUD (he portraited the character of Antoine Doinel in 4 of Truffaut's films). He performs a chansons singer, who is about to travel through the country for his next concert to give. Unfortunately his traveling van stops in the middle of nowhere. Not enough to be stucked deep in an unknown forest it is - of course - raining cats and dogs. Guided by a young man, who is searching the forest for his missing dog, Stevens reaches an auberge (motel) by foot. The owner, Mr. Bartel lives all alone in there. The auberge has been closed a long time ago for the public. But the kindly behaving old man has preserved the rooms as they where when guests used to be around. Bartel is a man who seems to earn his living with farming. No other houses are build near his estate. Stevens is offered to stay for the night and Bartel promises to get and repair his broken van the next morning. During the dinner Bartel tells Stevens that he was left by his wife and we feel, that he's still suffering from that loss. He seems to be most happy about that his guest is an artist, acclaiming he was an artist too. Not a singer but a comedian, who even won a price for his humor. By the way, his gone wife had been a passionded artist too, so he tells. After a short performance of Stevens, Bartel begins crying. Bartel is fascinated by the singers passion to his art and becomes very sad due to his lost past in which he obviously still lives (imaginary).Stevens goes to bed after this conversation, Thinking, he will be able to continue his journey the next day. But his unexpected rest at the auberge will be unwillingly prolonged for a much longer time than he could imagine at that moment.What happens next is a slow pasted tour de force of pain, agony, fear and hatred in the strangest way ever filmed for the big screen. Including the disturbing sickness of Bartel's mind. But he is not the only weird guy around this area. The most over-the-top portraited hillbillies ever shown up in a movie will appear in the near future to enlight the audience with laughs and - followed up - with the helpless fear of ""what will there be next?"". Have a seat, take a roller-coaster ride with a movie which leaves the shocks of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and STRAW DOGS easily behind. I understand this one as a very, very black comedy which is ""enjoyable"" for open minded people with a cineastic interest.There are some things in this movie which may let one think, this is an analogy to the passion of Jesus Christ. Some symbols cannot be overseen. The conversation about passion for the things you do by heart are significant. At the end, all things become clear (I don't want to spoil it here) and the audience is left alone with it. A very long end-credit sequence follows. Like in the movie SEUL CONTRE TOUS (I STAND ALONE/ MENSCHENFEIND) from director GASPAR NOÃÂ, an open end is presented. In NoÃÂ©'s movie a road is shown, leading to nowhere (or to an unknown future), while in Du Welz' movie we are left alone in a wide opened cold and foggy snow frozen forest area. We listen to the sounding wind. It blows and blows - not willing to end its cruel howling. No music, just the never ending isolation.If you see this ""wonderful"" movie you'll remember this howling a long time.8 out of 10P.S. please excuse possible spelling mistakes","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGEwZDBhNDktNGIyMi00NTQ0LTkyOTAtZDMxMjMzMDA5ZTJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR6,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Anyone who read Harold Robbins', ""The Carpetbaggers"", (some 40 years ago) which in turn spawned ""Nevada Smith"", gets a superbly fictionalized accounting of Howard Hughes. Such fiction prefixes reality. It took a great number of years before I finally saw ""The Outlaw"" - an eagerly awaited event.I've attempted to view the AMC-aired movie some three times - but got so antsy that I abandoned it. Few movies of this caliber have been so uneven. And yet it endures. Vintage alone gives the film status.There's nothing wrong with anecdotal (vignette) - points-of-view movies, but in ""The Outlaw"", it was like watching one of those lumbering, exasperating silent films: where the actors stand across from each other, and each speaks their lines as if orchestrated by an off-stage conductor. Spontaneity is not this movie's long suit.The actors: Jack Beutel is one of the most beautiful men to ever stand before a camera. His eyes are smoldering, his gaze laconic, his smile cheeky one moment and sensuous the next. Walter Huston is a young man in a middle-aged body; Thomas Mitchell (Scarlet's daddy in 'Gone With the Wind') is shifty, Irish, as conniving as Wally Beery, sniveling and crafty. And then there's the statuesque Jane Russell. Robbins gave us the intimate details of the suspension bridge-designed brassier - and Jane herself speaks of how she finally pulled the damn thing off and lined her breasts with a few Kleenex. She is as luscious as a near-nude Barbie doll, she is 19 years old, her lips inspire poetry - yet her voice is as monotonous as the Valley-inspired Val-speak of 25 years ago.I wouldn't hazard to guess Howard Hughes' emotional consistency in the movie, however something went hellishly wrong. Someone fell on his face when it came to editing and scoring. Take the music, for example. It's Scoring 101, embarrassingly manipulative, often overriding the dialogue and ranging from 'Pathetique' to 'The Lone Prairie' mÃÂ©lange.And then there's the acting: the Mexican senora rolls her eyes with all the panache of a 1940-Mexican B-movie bit actress. There is no spontaneity; she delivers her lines badly and with burning self-consciousness. And when Huston shoots Beutel in the hand, the latter doesn't even flinch; ditto, when he pierces both his ears with bullets. Staggering disbelief.As to the scene where Jane Russell falls for Jack Beutel and kisses him, it's like watching two trains headed straight for each other. Overblown, top-heavy, agonizingly overreaching...it nonetheless has the sexual potency of an orgasm. The music, the god-awful Close-CLOse-CLOSE UP of Jane's lips bearing down on the half-delirious Beutel. Wow, what power! The men watching this film back in (ca) 1940 must have had to cover their laps.I leave it to those with a sense of adventure to debate the movie's homoeroticism. There's no such implications from Beutel toward the two older men.The movie, finally, has to be taken for the time in which it was made. The cinematography is as splendid as if it were turned 10 years ago. It is impossibly uneven, anecdotal, horrifyingly edited, pathetically scored, wretchedly acted...yet the actors are painful in their beauty. Many of the IMDb comments suggest that the film wants watching several times. I second that. It can be slow, cantankerous, giddy, sullen - but Jane's and Jack's beauty are undeniable, Walter is everybody's favorite grandfather. Toland can be thanked for giving us the movie's clarity. --And Howard... Howard was just having fun.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2NmYWQ4YTQtNTZmYS00ODc0LTkzNzYtYWZiZTUzMzIwOWE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzg1ODEwNQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Now that I've watched it, I can't stress how much of a disappointment it was.MONSTERS: DARK CONTINENT is NOT a Sci-Fi / Horror movie. It is a war movie disguised as a Sci-Fi. And it's not even a very good war movie at that. It's somewhere in the middle. Very average. The biggest, of very few, somewhat redeeming qualities was the special effects. The monsters looked great! To bad they were overwhelmingly used as backdrop props, looking like a herd of buffalo at times.I'll never understand why this wasn't just strictly a war movie. It could have been an above average war movie if the money spent on the monster effects had been used for a bigger war setting or better actors.

Robinson, Lauren Bacall, Lionel Barrymore","44,039","A man visits his war buddy's family hotel and finds a gangster running things. As a hurricane approaches, the two end up confronting each other.","174","Superb cast and taut drama","While chiefly remembered as a Bogart/Bacall vehicle, this story of expatriate gangsters commandeering a sleepy tropical hotel is, in actuality, a tightly directed ensemble piece with acting chops to burn.There's Edward G. Robinson as Johnny Rocco--the brash, boisterous, sleazy gangster whose frailties (cowardice and a yearning for better times) gradually unfold before us.  There's Lionel Barrymore as James Temple, the delightfully feisty and crusty hotel owner overcome with revulsion at Rocco's presence.  There's Thomas Gomez, Harry Lewis, Dan Seymour and William Haade as Curly, Toots, Angel and Ralphie--Rocco's colorful but hard-edged thugs who are presences unto themselves.  There's Claire Trevor as Gaye, Rocco's declining, alcoholic moll who symbolizes more than anything how far Rocco has fallen.That's an awful lot.  Too much scenery-chewing from Bogart or Bacall would push it over the top--and director/screenwriter/demigod John Huston knows it.  He coaxes remarkably restrained and subtle performances out of his star couple.  The romantic tension between them is suggested but never shoved in the audience's face.  Bogart's wandering war vet Frank McCloud keeps his lips tight and plays his cards close to the chest--a streetwise outsider through and through.  Bacall's Nora Temple lets her anger and distaste pour out through her smoldering eyes more often than her mouth.Ultimately, the subtlety is so well-hidden between the gigantic performances of Robinson and Barrymore that you might miss just how sophisticated Frank's story is.  Disillusioned and drifting since the war, he stops in to visit the wife (Nora) and father (James) of a fallen comrade whose bravery he admired.  Implicit in his visit is an unspoken apology that it is he, and not their loved one, who is returning home.  The fallen soldier is a constant unseen presence in the film--his bravery and honor mocking what Frank sees as his own cowardice and inability to stand up to Rocco (Bogart's fast-talking explanation of why he didn't shoot Rocco when he had the chance is classic and rare--a protagonist lying to his friends and his audience--""One Rocco more or less isn't worth dying for!"").  Frank's eventual decision to take on Rocco and his hoods is a victory against the fear that plagues and shames him.In a larger sense, this is a true period movie about a generation of men returning home from the greatest conflict the world has ever known.  Most of our national memories of World War II are proud and triumphant, but, as with any war, it left countless people scarred physically and mentally.  Though Frank is a decorated soldier, he feels somehow that what he did wasn't enough (because he lived and his friend did not?), and he returns back to a country in which he has no place with no real pride or satisfaction.  The confrontation with Rocco affords him a chance (perhaps only possible in Hollywood or on the stage, where the story of ""Key Largo"" was first performed) to make things right with his world.While it has not aged as well as the better-known films of Bogart's and Huston's careers, ""Key Largo"" is a film that, for a little investment of attention and thought, will pay big dividends to anyone that really and truly loves movies.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFjNjc0N2YtZDQzOC00ODhjLWI0M2QtY2ZmZjU3NWUyYTI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

All I saw was a tedious thriller with an unforgivably low body count and only a couple of ingenious surprises in the script. Actually, if it weren't for Stacy Keach's vivid portrayal of the lonesome outback truck-driver, there would be pretty few to recommend, as his one-liners and lively imagination are the film's main ""fuel"". Keach plays the overworked trucker Pat Quick, bringing a cargo of frozen meat to Perth. He keeps himself awake by having conversations about poetry with his pet-dingo and thinking up possible backgrounds for the people he observes on the road. ""Rear Window""-style, he *thinks* he witnesses a murder and, due to a series of unlikely events, he becomes prime suspect in the police's search for a wanted serial killer. Overall, this is a poor crossover between the typically 70's road-movie and the most eminent Hitchcock-thrillers. There's the occasional clever remark and nifty camera-moment (notably the scene where road strips are reflected onto Keach's face) but there's too few action and suspense. Jamie Lee Curtis, who was immensely popular thanks to her contemporary knife-wielding slashers, stars to attract more horror buffs but her role is really rather limited. Richard Franklin made this film in between ""Patrick"" and his ultimate Hitchcock tribute ""Psycho II"". Both titles are much better than this ""Roadgames"".","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTVlMTk2YmYtNjQyYS00YTBmLWFhZjEtZjk0Zjc4MDFkYmExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzU4ODM5Nw@@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

And he was actually a hard working monarch, wrong headed at times, who had the longest reign (for any monarch - until Queen Victoria) in English history. He was George III (reigned 1760 - 1820 - the last nine years incapacitated by insanity and blindness). It was while he was ruling Great Britain that the American Revolution occurred, the French Revolution occurred, Napoleon rose and fell, and the industrial revolution hit Western Europe and the Americas. His is a key reign of modern history.We are taught he was a tyrant. Actually he was a conscientious supporter of the British Constitution, but he believed the colonists were disobedient children who should have been punished for their own good. Once it was obvious that they had won on the battlefield, George offered to abdicate. He was talked out of it, and eventually faced up to accepting the papers of the new Minister from the United States, Mr. John Adams. But he never really fully accepted it, and in his last decade the two countries fought a second war (the War of 1812).George III was a good, but strict family man. He and his wife Charlotte had seven sons and six daughters. But his sons were disappointments (the best one, Frederick, Duke of York, was a second-rate army commander who got involved in a scandal when his mistress, Mrs. Clarke, sold army commissions ""in the name of the Duke of York"" to undeserving men). The German Georges had a tradition of hatred between the Kings and their sons and heirs. George I was hated by George II because the former had imprisoned his wife (George II's mother) for life for infidelity (see SARABAND FOR DEAD LOVERS). George II was hated by his son, Frederick, Prince of Wales, and kicked the son out of the royal palace. Frederick died prematurely in 1758, so his son George III succeeded in 1760. His son, known as Florizel or ""Prinny"", had a long standing relationship with Mrs. Fitzherbert, a popular actress who happened to be Catholic. It was actually known by King George III that Prinny had an illegal marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert. As head of the Church of England, George III resented this act. He also disliked Prinny's support of Whig politicians Charles James Fox and Richard Sheridan (and sometimes Edmund Burke). The King was a good Tory - he never realized that Prinny's politics were a way of annoying him, and Prinny was even more reactionary than the King was. Prinny's gambling and drinking debts also annoyed the King.George was able to support the wise government (to 1789 anyway) of William Pitt the Younger. So supportive was he, that Pitt would reciprocate. For one day, in 1788, King George got out of his carriage in a forest, walked over to a tree, and had a long conversation with it. The tree, you see, was not a tree, but actually the now dead King Frederick the Great of Prussia. George III was showing signs of dementia. He was the first really certifiable monarch since Henry VI back in the 15th Century. George's son Prinny was ready to back a bill to remove his father and lock him away. Pitt saw Fox ready to replace him, and fought a long delaying action on the Regency bill. It worked, as Dr. Wills managed to bring the dementia under control.It would only be in 1811, when Pitt was dead for five years (and Fox for four) that a Tory Government passed a Regency bill, but by then Prinny was openly anti-Whig. It was politically allowable for the Percival Ministry to chance Prinny as Regent by then. After George III died he would become George IV and reign until 1830.This film has followed the tragic illness that incapacity (and eventually) destroyed George III, but only to the conclusion of it's first appearance in 1789. Nigel Hawthorne had performed the role to international acclaim on stage. He repeats it here, showing a thoughtful monarch (witness why he is upset about the errant colonies gaining independence - the valuable natural resources are lost, and he is aware of this). He is puritanical when normal, but with a son like Prinny who could blame him for being sorely disappointed. From the start you find yourself rooting for Hawthorne's monarch, who was not the evil tyrant that Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson painted.Rupert Everett shows the callousness of the Prince of Wales, who is so selfish that at one point (when safely alone) Pitt and Fox wonder if their American cousins were right about abolishing the monarchy. Ian Holm, as Dr. Wills, is properly a mixture of early pioneer of psychology and tyrant. A wonderful film of how a national crisis was met and overcome peacefully. And timely too. Within weeks of the recovery of George III in 1789 the Bastille fell in Paris.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkxN2ZmZjUtNDhkZS00NWZiLWEyNGEtNDFkYmJmM2MzNDg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjg1NDcxNDE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He also had the big budget needed to craft a truly spectacular remake of the original 1925 classic silent film. And, he rightly felt that a new movie based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's science fiction masterpiece had better be up to the task. Allen originally intended using the ""Stop-Motion animation"" technique (made popular by Ray Harryhausen) to bring his prehistoric monsters to life. But, just as production was about to commence, Twentieth-Century Fox, who commissioned the film (and were then experiencing severe monetary shortages, due to production problems with their money guzzling ""Cleopatra"") slashed the budgets of nearly every film currently being produced. ""The Lost World"" was no exception, and Allen's dreams of a Sci-Fi Spectacular were crushed. Being a resourceful film maker, though, he did the best he could with what he had, and that turned out to be very good indeed.For his cast, he chose British character actor Claude (""The Invisible Man"") Rains to play the indomitable Professor Challenger, leader of the expedition. As Playboy Johnny Roxton, he cast another British actor, Michael Rennie. David Hedison played newsman Ed Malone, Jill St. John played Jennifer Holmes, daughter of Malone's publisher and Fernando Lamas was Gomez, the expedition's pilot. Supporting them were Jay Novello, as a cowardly guide, and Vittina Marcus as a helpful island native girl. Forced to forego his original Stop-Motion technique, Allen had to make do with photographing lizards, alligators and such, adding horns and gills when necessary. The result was pretty much the way it sounds - the creatures this bunch discovered were a long way from prehistoric beasts. Nevertheless, the movie entertains, with truly beautiful wide screen photography, a fantastic collection of colors which really bring the striking sets to eerie life. As for the performances, they are decent enough. Rains has gotten plenty of criticism over the years for his bombastic Challenger, but that's the way the character was written, and Rains is true to the material, and highly enjoyable too. Michael Rennie is a bit colorless in his big game hunter part, but he does have some good scenes as well. David Hedison is OK as Malone, who falls for Jennifer (Roxton's girlfriend) though their romance must have ended up heavily edited, as there's little evidence of it here. Ms. St John and Ms. Marcus are mainly eye candy, (this WAS the '60s after all) but act capably enough, though for a woman described as ""brave as a lioness"". Jill certainly does a lot of screaming while dressed in a very flattering, if impractical wardrobe (which includes a Toy Poodle). Ray Stricklyn is very persuasive as her rather immature but compassionate brother. Lamas and Novello are the supposed villains of this piece, though Lamas has a reason for his hostility. Allen's direction is good and the score by Bert Shefter and Paul Sawtell adds immeasurably to the drama and suspense. All in all, the picture is perfect Saturday MatinÃÂ©e fare, and though the script is talky in places, it still delivers the goods at the climax. The movie is a textbook example of a period when celluloid escapism was all viewers demanded, and here, they got it In spades. Fox Home Video has just released ""The Lost World"" as a two-disc DVD set, with special features (trailer, newsreels and galleries of promotional material) from the film on disc one, and a restored version (with a few outtakes!) of the 1925 original on disc two. Allen's film looks wonderful in it's anamorphic CinemaScope transfer, and after years of suffering through the faded pan-and-scanned prints used for TV and video this is really a revelation. The new stereo soundtracks are equally impressive and make this film, from a producer/director who would one day be known as the ""Master of Disaster', (thanks to such fare as The Poseidon Adventure' and ""The Towering Inferno"") a must have for collectors.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQ3NzlmNzktNzU2Mi00NDlhLWI4YjYtZTljZjllNjg4MGZkL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

His past and his friendship with the sheriff land them both in trouble.","31","Not a ""B"" Western","""The Desperadoes"" (1943) is a genuine classic, not for its story (which is fairly routine), but for its technical production elements. This was a landmark western, the biggest ever at the time of its release and all the more unique because it was a Columbia production-a lightweight studio with a bottom feeding reputation. Only Fox's ""Jesse James"" (also starring Randolph Scott) from a few years earlier gave anywhere near this lavish a treatment to the genre. Although it would be eclipsed in a few years by ""The Searchers"" and ""High Noon"", ""The Desperadoes"" was a ground breaking effort and a historical treasure. In 1863, the economy in the town of Red Valley, Utah is based on rounding up and selling wild horses to the Union Army. The script gets a little messed up here with references to the railroad (which was several years away in Utah's future) and Custer's Last Stand (Custer was busy fighting Stuart in Pennsylvania at the time) but these are not important plot elements. Red Valley has an honest sheriff, Steve Upton (Scott), but the banker and several citizens are corrupt; robbing their own bank each time the government pays for a herd of horses. The town is visited by Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford), a famous outlaw who is an old friend Steve's. He wants to go straight, especially after falling for the pretty livery stable owner Alison McLeod (Evelyn Keyes). Cheyenne's partner ""Nitro"" Rankin (Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams) is mainly there for comic relief as are Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and the town judge (Raymond Walburn who models his character on Frank Morgan's ""Wizard of Oz"" crystal ball faker). Taking no chances with their huge budget Columbia packed this thing with tons of action and every western movie element but Indians and covered wagons. There is the best wild horse stampede ever filmed, a spectacular barroom brawl, an explosive climax, romance, and three-strip Technicolor. All this stuff doesn't necessarily fit together but who would have cared back in 1943. Unity is a problem as it tries to be both a serious action western and a comedy. The cinematography was probably the best ever at the time of its filming. The indoor scenes are solid but it is the naturalistic outdoor photography that is truly impressive; both the lyrical static shots and the moving camera filming of the action sequences. Scott and Claire Trevor were top billed, but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford, who would soon be their biggest star. And Director Charles Vidor utilized the film to showcase his new wife Keyes (whose portrayal of Scarlett's sister in ""Gone With the Wind"" had connected with audiences more than any small part in the history of films). The Ford-Keyes dynamic is ""The Desperadoes"" most unique and important feature. Rather than go for the clichÃÂ© ""love triangle"" with Scott and/or Trevor (which it first appears will happen), the entire romantic focus is on the two younger actors. This was probably the best role Keyes ever got and she makes the most of it. Playing a tomboyish but extremely sexy young woman who looks great in both leather pants and dresses, and who rides and fights like Kiera Knightley's character in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". This was revolutionary at the time and coincided with the 1942 formation of the WAAC for WWII military service. ""The Desperadoes"" is one film that has been well taken care of and the print looks like it is brand new. Unfortunately there are no special features on the DVD. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWZlZGVhYTYtYzliMi00MDE1LTkxNWUtYzdlNGU3OWY0ZDg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Let's be clear: Jesse James was in essence a terrorist. He rode with Bloody Bill Anderson and William Quantrill, who were Confederate raiders who performed unspeakable atrocities in the name of slavery. James was no Robin Hood. He was in it for the money. The gang is represented in this movie as good-hearted guys just doin' what's right and carin' bout their mamas. Horse-hockey! Read the new biography by T.J. Stiles to get the true story.

Loosely based on a Buddhist fable, Onibaba tells a story of lust, envy, wrath and betrayal which is wrapped up by way of a hideous demon mask.

Their existence is upset one day, however, when the son's friend, Hachi, returns from the war to the place where the two women live.The title of the film roughly translates into English as 'demon woman', and that is an apt title for this story. Although the film doesn't contain any actual demons or other mythical creatures, the real horror comes from the character actions and the film succeeds as a horror film in that way. The atmospheric location, which consists of a huge area covered in reeds, adds weight to film's claim to the horror genre also and the location provides a truly stunning set for this story to take place. The film also features a dark pit, which the women use to dump the bodies of the Samurai they kill, which adds to the fantasy and inventive element of the story. The film is cinematic poetry on many levels, from the bleak yet beautiful cinematography, to the elements of the location mentioned - all the way down to it's central piece of imagery - the mask itself. The mask is the film's centrepiece, and the part's where it features are the most memorable of the movie.Prolific Japanese director Kaneto ShindÃÂ´ takes us on a tour-de-force of atmospheric direction. He spends a fair amount of time focusing on the reeds blowing in the wind and many of his angles focus on the sky, which will no doubt irritate the less adept viewers amongst us - but the rest of us know that this is a way for ShindÃÂ´ to aptly portray his setting, and every instance when he did that was a delight for yours truly. There are many great shots in this movie, and if you're a fan of technical prowess, Onibaba is your film; and even if you're not, this film is a must see.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRiYmNmNTEtM2FlNC00ODRlLWFiMmQtYmNlNzgxY2MzMzNkL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I'm not saying that the film is 100% accurate, obviously some dramatic licence has to be taken, but its not far off. Many people on this site have questioned the accuracy, and validity of the film, especially mentioning the lack of consideration of the treatment of the Jews. However that is not what this film is about (if that is what you want see The Pianist or Schindler's List - also excellent films).This film is looking at how some German youths avoided the Hitler Youth and the nazi regime insofar as they could, and what they spent their time doing (dancing, listening to swing music and being with their friends).It does show some useful aspects about how the Hitler Youth were expected to behave and the propaganda they were exposed to, as well as about swing youth and their attitude to the regime.It is an entertaining and poignant film which explores friendship,romance and growing up against the backdrop of one of the most vilified periods in modern historyBasically Swing Kids does what it does well. Maybe it isn't a Schindler's List, but it does have its merits.Watch it and you'll find them!BTW - could I just point out, many people on here have referred to the Holocaust, as though it is interchangeable with the Nazi regime, and have used the phrase in their reviews. Just to clear up this: the holocaust specifically refers to the gassing of Jews at extermination camps from 1942 onwards, essentially the Final Solution. As this film is set in 1939 it is prior to this.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU5MzFhOTctNjc0Mi00YmY1LTljOGItOGJlMGZlMmZjMWU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTYwMTcxOTYy._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I went into this film with high hopes, and whilst I enjoyed it, I was a little underwhelmed by the scripting which ultimately let down the brilliant leading lady.I have really been enjoying Laure Calamy's evolution as an actor in recent years, and her turn as 'Antoinette' in 'My Lover, My Donkey & I' (also known as 'Antoinette in the Cevennes') won her hearts around the world, this character of 'Iris' feels like a bit of a step back. As always likable and relatable as Laure is in her movies (the actor is blessed with a warm, natural air about her), I wonder if she is a little limited range wise, as these morally fluid characters she has played several times now ('Les Cyclades' - aka 'Two Tickets To Greece' last year was another role in that vein), will get a bit thin, if the material is not sharp enough to carry her.'Full Time' for which Laure was again Cesar nominated was terrific and she displayed a gritty and more serious side; so too 'Annie's Fire', but 'Iris & The Men' suffers from too many tonal shifts; making it hard to connect with our protagonist at times.There is an inventive use of technology in this movie and some funny ways to convey the journey 'Iris' takes in getting to know herself sexually, but in the end, the conclusion and piece de resistance, feels somewhat contrived and therefore not earned.But there is a lot to enjoy about Laure here. Her comedic tics and timing are well utilised. I just wish the material had been stronger, sharper and that the tone was a little more consistent. Depending on your own morality, you may like and endorse everything that 'Iris' instigates for herself. For me, I appreciated the journeys that Writer/Director Vignal and star Calamy took in the Cevennes more than the urbane Parisian ones taken here.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFiNmJhMWMtOGIzOC00YWZhLWJkYWItNmVkNjU1YWQxYzdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc2MjgxNzg@._V1_UY209_CR9,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

"Heart of Champions","","PG-13","119.0","Drama, Sport","5.9","","Michael Mailer","Michael Shannon, Alexander Ludwig, Charles Melton, Alex MacNicoll","2,318","During their last year at an Ivy League college in 1999, a group of friends and crew teammates' lives are changed forever when an army vet takes over as coach of their dysfunctional rowing team.","23","shannon keeps it afloat","Greetings again from the darkness. We've seen most of this before in a long list of inspirational sports stories where the beleaguered, tough as nails coach comes in and unites a rag-tag team while teaching life lessons. However, with (2-time Oscar nominee) Michael Shannon cast as the coach, we know there will be at least one performance worth watching. The screenplay is from Vojin Gjaja and it's directed by Michael Mailer (son of 2-time Pulitzer Prize winning author, Norman Mailer).The film opens in May 1999 as a crew team finishes last in the Collegiate Rowing Championships. Inner-team bickering and animosity exists thanks to domineering Team Captain Alex (Alexander Ludwig, ""Vikings""). The following year, the team is introduced to their new coach, Coach Murphy (Shannon). He has a different approach and he's focused on creating a team, rather than a few guys with oars. All we really learn about Murphy is that he's an alum and former rower for this same college, and an Army and Vietnam veteran who lost friends in the war, and carries that burden with him every day.Alex (Ludwig) is back for his senior year and his goal is to be chosen for the Olympics team ... a goal his over-bearing father (David James Elliott, ""JAG"") reminds him of every few minutes. The other two crew members who get significant screen time are John (Alex MacNicoll, ALL ROADS TO PEARLA, 2019) and newcomer Chris (Charles Melton, THE SUN IS ALSO A STAR, 2019). John is dating Alex's ex-girlfriend Sara (Ash Santos), while transfer student Chris is dealing with a recent tragedy, and also attracted to Sara's friend Nisha (Lilly Krug, EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE, 2021). And yes, at times the melodrama of these folks is just a bit too heavy-handed and soap opera-ish. Coach Murphy is clearly the most interesting character, yet the film spends the bulk of its time on the youngsters and their daily journey.One of the plusses here is that the sport at the center is rowing, which at least veers from the typical sports fare. But then we learn very little about the sport, other than it blisters your hands and causes your lungs to burn ... and there is ""swing"" which occurs when the team is in full sync. Mr. Shannon does as much with his underwritten role as possible; however, overall the movie is just a bit too generic with its final lesson of, ""a loss is not the end."" Should you have an interest in a true life rowing story, allow me to recommend the 2013 book, ""The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Olympics"" by Daniel James Brown Opened October 29, 2021.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDhiZDNkYTgtZDEwNC00NGJjLWI5OWMtZDdlZDQ4NzY5NzlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzg5MzIyOA@@._V1_UY209_CR8,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This admiration for General Zhao's qualities cannot be more obvious when it is he who opens the first battle proper, with a very familiar character episode involving the rescue of the infant son (and future lord) of his master Liu Bei, thereby sealing his reputation of valor, earning admiration even from enemy Cao Cao. Fans of Liu Bei's camp will undoubtedly cheer at the appearances of his sworn brothers General Guan Yu (who is worshiped as a Deity until this very day, and remains one of my favourite characters besides Zhao Yun) and General Zhang Fei, whose gruffness translates to instant war-ready prowess. While Liu's army is clearly routed in a military loss, it explained the dilemma of Liu's leadership. One which is based on sincerity, a quality which persuaded his chief military strategist and genius all round Zhuge Liang (Takeshi Kaneshiro) to join his cause, but one which lacked military strength in numbers, despite having some of the best generals of the time under his leadership.Which of course Cao Cao admires and probably is envious about, given his superior strength in numbers came from surrendering armies, whose loyalty remains questionable, and of course with individual generals who can't surpass the abilities of those from Liu. Playing the king like a puppet and having him issue a decree for permission to pursue Liu Bei who has fled southwards, he sets his sights also on warlord Sun Quan, for a more personal reason akin to the story of Helen of Troy. Zhuge Liang, knowing their current weakness, seeks an alliance between the armies of Liu and Sun Quan, and this forms most of the first half, where he had to play envoy to cajole and persuade, especially in convincing Sun Quan's most trusted adviser Zhou Yu (Tony Leung) that war is inevitable and they should form a win-win partnership.And here's where great minds think alike, and watching both Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang do a friendly pit against each other is nothing short of amazing, where so little says so much. It helps of course that both Tony Leung and Takeshi Kaneshiro have been paired up as leading men on screen before, in Wong Kar-wai's Chungking Express and in Andrew Lau and Alan Mak's Confession of Pain too, lending some much established and credible chemistry as men who share admiration in each other's ability, especially when Zhou Yu seemed to have a fairer balance between fighting skill and intellect. With one side having highly disciplined soldiers with good morale, and the other having renowned generals to be leaders, it doesn't take a genius to realize the advantages gained in fending off a common enemy together.The fight sequences were pure spectacle, with old school wire work combined with technological wizardry to showcase some large scale battle sequences at a macro level, or to highlight the immense naval numbers that Cao Cao brings to battle. Formations and strategies take centerstage in a first major confrontation on land, where one gets to see John Woo's interpretation of Zhuge Liang's ""ba-gua"" (8 stratagems) strategy, made more entertaining through the continuation of what we have already seen in each general's fighting ability, each given a unique style befitting the characters in folklore, such as Guan Yu and his Guan Dao (Green Dragon Crescent Blade) and Zhao Yun (Hu Jun) and his spear. There's the usual bellowing cape and slow motion in Woo's signature style, but these were kept to a minimum, as are the pigeons (though they do make an appearance, but serving some purpose).Perhaps it is the success of the fight sequences that had left some lamenting for more, but bear in mind this is just but the first half of the movie, setting things up. The major war sequences of course are left in the second movie which we will get to see come early next year. Like The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions, expect the next movie to go on an all out assault. I felt that already is a fair balance of drama and action here, especially when this installment has to cover a broad base given numerous characters, which should provide fans (of Three Kingdoms) something to cheer about. Chang Chen provides his Sun Quan with enough self-doubt, and in a small story arc has to seek his inner confidence ala King Leonidas in 300, while model Lin Chiling's much touted debut movie appearance, was limited to just a few scenes of lovey-dovey moments, which unfortunately for audiences in Singapore, her sex scene with Tony Leung got edited out in order for distributors to get a PG rating to put more bums on seats.I had wondered how Tony Leung would have faired as Zhuge Liang instead of Kaneshiro, but felt that the musical chairs casting somehow became a blessing in disguise. Kaneshiro's good looks might have made some doubt his ability to play the smartest man alive during the era, but he did an excellent job in bringing out the humility and self-deprecation of the man whose never flashy nor overconfident of his abilities, and one who swears his talents to his lord Liu Bei. Tony Leung on the other hand brought about a fine balance of brains and brawn to the Zhou Yu character, whom I suspect in Woo's version, would be credited with much success for his part in Red Cliff, rather than the accolades all going to Zhuge Liang. After you see the reliable Tony Leung in this role, you'll know for sure that Chow Yun-Fatt could probably never had brought the kind of gravitas Leung brought to the role.Red Cliff is hands down highly recommended","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyOTQ3NDA1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY3NzM4Mg@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

They both move to Paris together with their cat after the death of Frances' husband. The film's tone is deadpan and absurdist, and almost feels like an uneven and often unfulfilling amalgamation of Woody Allen and Luis BuÃÂ±uel. But try as it might, the film sorely lacks the intellectual wit of Woody Allen or the intricately clever ambiguity of BuÃÂ±uel's best films.The first major problem with the film is that it lacks a clear plot. It contains several short set pieces with slightly-absurd, sarcastic dialogue that could have made for mildly amusing mini-short films (a throwback-style cruise ship en route to Paris, a sÃÂ©ancÃÂ©, cocktail gatherings.) Yet none of them really help hold up the story, much less create a narrative crux to keep viewers engaged. The two main characters are moderately well-developed, but their personalities never feel especially original or unique. Even though Frances has lost a loved one, the film doesn't really have an emotional core or sense of empathy towards its characters. Instead, there's a level of coldness and unreliability even within a darkly comedic context that recalls the polarizing tones of Yorgos Lanthimos' movies. The attempts at surreal humor aren't funny or even clever; as far as dark comedy goes, the film is neither funny enough to feel well-accomplished as an original comedy nor dark enough to feel shocking and tonally opaque. The cast does serviceably fine with the material they are given, but no one gets much of a range here in character. For a movie attempting to come off as sophisticated, it also doesn't leave much for viewers to really think about or interpret underneath its narrative surface either. The only aspects of the film that I can unequivocally commend are the cinematography of Paris as well as the simple yet playfully elegant score.All in all, this strangely forgettable film (both literally and figuratively) neither has the creativity nor wit to shine as a quirky comedy. There are ingredients here and there that could pack more of a punch within the film if given the right context within a more well-composed story, but without such cleverness, the film feels undercooked as a whole. Not recommended. 4/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAyMTY0NmMtZDU0Zi00NzhlLWJmM2ItZGVhYjA5MDE3MzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTgxNDIzMTY@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Though we have our boys, we are waiting to adopt a girl, so the theme of parents who want a child that they can't seem to have, and the theme of taking in a child that you didn't give birth to and/or adoption really hit home for us. I sat at the end of the movie and cried, and they were tears of laughter and sadness and hope all mixed up together. Even if you're not interested in adoption, this is really a touching show.

It centres on three sisters: one dying of cancer, another trapped in a repellent marriage, and the last engaged in an uncomfortable affair. Moving between these three women is the maid, who tends the dying woman in her agony and, in one stunning scene, holding her to her naked bosom like a mother holding a child.It is not, then, a barrel of laughs. Bergman films are not often for casual viewing, and I certainly won't be taking this one home to watch with my mother.Like a great classical composer, Bergman uses contrast to enormous effect. Muted sounds which force you to strain to listen are punctuated with heart-rending screams from the dying Agnes. The colour scheme is a disquieting red, fading into pastoral greens and blues as the women reminisce about their younger life.The characters also contrast uncomfortably. The two younger sisters, Karin and Maria, are sitting the deathwatch for their sister, but their task arouses no compassion in them. They are appalled and repelled by their sister's suffering, but they will not hold her hand or comfort her. The mutual dislike for each other is palpable. This contrasts with the simple humanism of their maid Anna ÃÂ whom they callously talk about firing, once their sister is dead.Set in the late 19th Century, the story flits intermittently between present and past, fleshing out the motivations and the stories of the sisters. One of these flashbacks confronts the audience with one of the most disturbing image in cinema, a repressed Karin cutting her vagina with glass to avoid sex with her husband.Only a director of Bergman's calibre could make such a film riveting. Yet riveting it is. Bergman gets sensational performances from his four main leads; regulars Liv Ullmann, Ingrid Thurin and Harriet Andersson and a majestic, understated Kari Sylwan. To call this film Ibsenesque would be a slur on the originality of Bergman's vision. It is a testimony to his genius that this may not be his best film, yet it is one of the most striking films in modern cinema. I cannot recommend it highly enough. 9/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjFmZTdlZWEtOTY0MS00MWJlLWEyOGMtZmI5ZGI1N2FiZWYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

If you are between the ages of eight and twelve, and you still hated it, then yes, it is understandable. But it is ridiculous for an adult to say that they hated this movie because it is 'too juvenile'. I think this movie has a great plot and a great message to young children. Be truthful to your friends, and you will succeed beyond your dreams. I also read the book, and this movie is quite close to the book, which is a good thing for a movie to be.

It's a real world thing, but would she really stay at a job that ignores her for that long? She had more gumption as a teenage girl.3. I had a few laughs, so the jokes weren't completely horrible.

The decidedly non-political correctness in the scenes with the obviously gay guy, portrayed by Jack Cassidy (whose lapdog is appropriately named ""faggot"" and has a hilarious scene humping Eastwood's leg); with the Indian girl (Eastwoods laconic snarl ""Screw Marlon Brando"" is unforgettable); with the ""black chick"" (says Eastwood to the Afro-American actress Vonetta McGee) might turn off some of today's viewers or bring the film on the map for viewers who have grown up with Rap Music and consider the occasional four-letter word in ""8 Mile"" already daring.The story itself is not really important (a classic spy/action thriller with a twist) but the camera direction is superb and Eastwood's well-known love for Jazz music seaps through occasionally.

Although I had long been a fan of Altman's 1971 masterpiece, I would probably never have called it the greatest western film. Having sat through most of the Rios, the Searchers, Red River, Stage Coach, the Leone Spaghetti Westerns, and the more current incarnations of the genre (Unforgiven, Dances with Wolves, All the Pretty Horses, et al.), I will say without hesitation that McCabe is a superior film (and a superior western) to all those listed.It is not, of course, a traditional western, nor does it hold true to traditional 'values' of the western. You will not find any rampaging indians, and the typical shots of vast prairies or a surreal Monument Valley. Your hero is a conniving gambler and the heroine is a whore (and one that quite distinctly lacks a heart of gold). They're sympathetic, but they're also quite real with all the faults and foibles humans typically have. The landscape is brown and green; trees are everywhere and it looks like it's wet most of the time (which is appropriate to a film taking place in the Northwest). One of the few ""cowboys"" in the film dies in his underwear.By a long shot, then, this is not your typical western, but it is better.The wooden characters of old are replaced with real people to whom we can relate and about whom we can care. Furthermore, the environment - dark, dirty, wet, and all around not terribly inviting - seems more in line with the historical west than the traditional western. The West was not the nicest place to live; it was dangerous and inhospitable as it is in McCabe.I could go on and on about how Altman inverts the western film tradition throughout the movie (as well as how he dismantles the notion that capitalism is a good economic and social system), but I will not. There is no need to treat McCabe that academically. The film is simply wonderful and entertaining - terrific performances, wonderful cinematography, a fascinating story, and great (and very Altman-esque) direction with overlapping conversations and well-handled improvisations. The movie also has the most perfect soundtrack I have ever heard. The songs - by the one and only Leonard Cohen - perfectly match the mood and atmosphere of the film and moreover feel like artifacts of that bygone era depicted in the film. That they were not written or recorded specifically for McCabe is astounding, as they are such an integral and organic part of this film.If you have not seen this film, please do so; it's well worth the time and, unlike Nashville and Short Cuts - Altman's other masterpieces - it's very accessible.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMTk0MmMtY2I0YS00NjcwLTk2NjYtOWFlOTA0M2EzNjgxL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

"The Innocents","","A","100.0","Horror","7.8","88.0","Jack Clayton","Deborah Kerr, Peter Wyngarde, Megs Jenkins, Michael Redgrave","33,115","A young governess for two children becomes convinced that the house and grounds are haunted.","204","Ghost story or psychological study? Who can say?","""The Innocents"" is one of those films that prove subtlety and imagination can be ten times more terrifying than loud noises or things that go bump in the night. There are no raging spirits or escaped madmen here. Nor will you find that stock of today's second rate horror films -- the creature that embodies evil and finds amazingly obscure ways in which to slaughter naughty teenagers. No, this movie scars one's psyche with darkness and silence and possibility, all mingled with its refusal to give the audience an easy answer at the end.Based on Henry James' novella, ""The Turn Of The Screw,"" the story is deceptively simple. An inexperienced governess is hired to care for two orphaned children in an isolated British manor and slowly comes to believe the ghosts of the previous governess and her brutish lover are trying to possess the children's souls. Being a decent woman ""who loves children,"" she fights back the only way she can -- by confronting the evil head on. But the question is, does the evil truly exist...or is it all in her own mind?As told by James, the novella is a startling ghost story, without question. He adds his usual psychological insights to the characters, but never do you doubt the ghosts exist. The defining moment comes when Miss Giddens sees Quint's face in a dark window then later finds a locket bearing his portrait and comes to her realization, ""Oh, he's a ghost!"" But in the movie, Truman Capote and William Archibald reverse this sequence -- she finds the locket first and THEN sees the man's face in the window -- and all simple explanations go out the door.Is Miss Giddens imagining things? Has she become overwhelmed by the responsibility of raising two precocious children without any sort of support from their selfish uncle? Is she merely sexually repressed and immature enough to transfer her crush on the uncle to a boy not even into puberty yet? And what of Flora, Miles' sister? If this is merely sexual repression on Miss Giddens' part, then why does she drag a little girl into the morass? Throughout the film, Miss Giddens offers evidence of her concerns -- a letter received from Miles' schoolmaster that she cannot fully share with Mrs. Grose because the woman cannot read; her awareness that the two innocents in her charge have a far more advanced knowledge of life than children that age normally would; stories told by Mrs. Grose about Miss Jessel and Quint and how they treated the children. So could it be the spirits of two miserable adults have come back to reclaim life in the persons of Miles and Flora? It could go either way.There is not one wrong moment in this movie. Not one. The first time I saw it was in New York City on a double bill with ""The Haunting"" (1963), a ""things that go bump in the night"" kind of movie. The audience and I howled through that one, it was so much silly fun. And we chuckled through the first ten minutes of ""The Innocents"" (especially when Mrs. Grose tells Miss Giddens, ""I'm SO glad you're here,"" with a little quiver in her voice), but by the end of that film (and I use the word ""film"" deliberately), the entire theater was dead silent. Any film that can shut up a room full of rowdy New Yorkers has got to be damned good.So...is ""The Innocents"" a ghost story or psychological study? Who can say? And to be honest, who cares? It is, at the very least, a damned good movie...and at the very best, a horror story that makes ""The Shining,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""The Others"" and even ""Psycho"" (a movie I love) look like the works of children. That this film is not available on DVD is a travesty.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGQyNjBjNTUtNTM1OS00YzcyLWFhNTgtNTU0MDg3NzBlMDQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Hardly a great actress but an absolute stunner, the Javanese-born former model came to international attention in the 1975 smash Black Emanuelle (that's one M to avoid prosecution). She also guested with Sylvia Krystal the same year in Emmanelle 2 as a masseuse, then made five more `official' Black Emanuelle sequels for the notorious `Joe D'Amato'/Aristide Massaccesi, including the gut-munching sleaze of Emanuelle And The Last Cannibals. Countless other titles in Gemser's 50-plus filmography have been retitled to cash in on her fame. Emanuelle's Daughter started out as `Sexy Moon', certainly not one of Gemser's best - my pick is Divine Emanuelle (aka Love Camp, 1980), a ludicrous Jonestown-style musical (!). An often turgid softcore soap opera and travelogue, it was filmed in Cyprus at the height of the Euro-disco craze (you can see the Village People perform `YMCA' on a TV set!). A rich industrialist dies under mysterious circumstances, and his widow ÃÂEmanuelle' returns to his estate in control of his fortune and his young rebellious daughter. It appears Emanuelle was subject to her husband's perverted whims, and now seeks revenge on his partners-in-crime with the help of the vicious womanizing disco king Mario (Gemser's long-time husband Gabriele Tinti). The film explores the daughter's budding sexuality; Cyprus must have a lower age of consent, as she looks about 14 with her gear off. Familiar face Gordon Mitchell, former muscleman and star of countless westerns and Hercules films, plays one of the husband's cronies, and is dubbed by the voice of Bud Spencer - I keep expecting him to down 14 hotdogs and clock Gemser on the nut!

Most importantly it also highlights the struggle on African-Americans who although have the knowledge and experience and work in high risk security positions, still make minimum wage and have challenges in their lives due to low income.

Keep that in mind when this movie sucks you down into the abyss of one of post war West-Germany's darkest rough places. It's a biopic, not a horror-movie. People say that this movie was all about shock value and grossly exaggerated, or a ""wannabe Lars von Trier"" flick ... but this is the movie Lars von Trier wishes he would have come up with. The settings are an exact 1:1 replica of the original sites. The bar ""Der Goldene Handschuh"" in Hamburg still exists to this day and frankly hasn't changed much since then. Fritz Honka's flat was carefully recreated, the storyline and characters pictured is authentic as close as it gets. This also means that it isn't very pleasant to the eye.The story takes us to a journey to the alcoholic dark underclass scene of the 1970's in Hamburg's Reeperbahn, close the harbor, following one of Germanys most infamous serial killers, Fritz Honka speaking with a strong East-German dialect. Mind you, this is not a Hollywood picture and it's one of those movies that would never get an Academy Award even though cinematography, costumes, acting and set-design is beyond astonishing. It's just too real. More often than not the picture is layered behind a thick cigarette smoke layer inside nicotine yellowed walls. The soundtrack solely consists of contemporary German ""Schlager""music, including Honka's favorite song ""Es geht eine TrÃÂ¤ne auf Reisen"" (""A tear goes on a journey"") ... all those songs are just harmless contemporary witnesses but add so much to the dense atmosphere and convert them into the sickish part of the narration.I'm a big fan of gritty movies but this movie showed me that I've seen nothing yet. Frankly I had to stop the movie about three times because it was just too HEAVY. It's graphic, it's gross, it's too much at times. And yet I consider it one of the best indie movies of the last decade. It is in lieu of Gaspar NoÃÂ©'s ""Seul contre tous"" (I stand alone) exept ... this really happened.

They try to meet up on important occasions, in this case Jeff Chang's (Justin Chon) birthday.Jeff Chang is finally turning 21 and with that age his best friends, Casey (Skylar Astin) and Miller (Miles Teller), believe comes a new stage in Chang's life; one filled with alcohol and girls.Chang is a straight-A student who is preparing for an upcoming interview to gain admittance to medical school.

Justin Chon (Jeff Chang) further pushes the comedy bar with his use of physical humor. Skylar Astin (Casey) plays the typical preppy and awkward sidekick.Even with a pleasant cast, the film fails to present anything original or creative. While it offers a few laughs, too many scenes are either lackluster, or exaggerated, and some of the humor is forced.""The Hangover"" was much more imaginative than ""21 and Over,"" which has fewer plot twists and a rushed ending.Even worse, the film reinforces all possible stereotypes including the smart Asian, the party alcoholic white male, crazy Latinas, and out of control college students.The film is far from a masterpiece.

So you-know-what hits the fan when his three sisters serially take him in after his release from jail. He's nothing but tsuris. It's no wonder that his most enduring relationship is with his dog, Willie Nelson.Thanks to Rudd's everyman persona and the genial obliviousness he brings to Ned, you can't help but feel empathy. As with a suspense film where the audience knows what's going to happen but the characters are still in the dark, you want to yell out to warn Ned before he screws up again. His perfect comic timing and the made-to-order script make sure you get the most laughs from his predicament. Luckily, there's more to him than just bad luck. He's also an endearing white angel on the shoulders of his sisters, helping them fight their devils as he becomes an unwitting catalyst for change. The movie's impressively talented and good-looking cast includes Zooey Deschanel, Emily Mortimer, and Elizabeth Banks (looking a lot like Parker Posey) as sisters. What's more, Rashinda Jones and Hugh Dancy add to the already high eye-candy quotient. Steve Coogan plays Ned's deliciously distasteful brother-in-law in his inimitable unpleasant-guy way.The film is smartly directed by Jesse Peretz from a story he developed with his sister, Evgenia Peretz. I saw this at the Sundance screening in Brookline, Massachusetts, where director Peretz said they wrote it for Rudd, whom he clearly enjoys working with, and who wouldn't? Even though they stuck to the script, Rudd improvised at least two of the movie's funniest bits.A fun ride throughout, the film only has a couple of weak spots. One scene has Ned comfortably telling a white lie, something so out of character it was jolting to the point of distraction. The ending could use some reshaping, and perhaps it might get some before general release. But even as is, this movie is about as charming and hilarious as Rudd can be, which is quite sizable.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NjM3Mzg0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk4MDI3NQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's a disservice to the original character, and the cinematography is laughably bad.Save your time and money - this movie is a disaster in every sense.The characters in this ill-conceived film are an absolute mess. First of all, the attempt to depict Conan, the iconic barbarian, as a lesbian woman across different centuries is not only historically inaccurate but also a blatant misinterpretation of the character's essence. Conan's complex personality, which includes his fierce warrior spirit, cunning intelligence, and rugged charm, is completely lost in this misguided adaptation.Furthermore, the supporting characters are one-dimensional and lack any meaningful development. They seem like mere afterthoughts in a poorly constructed narrative. Their motivations are unclear, and their actions often make no sense, leaving the audience disconnected from their plight.As for the storyline, it's a convoluted mess. The movie jumps haphazardly between different time periods, making it nearly impossible to follow the plot's progression. This disjointed approach does nothing to engage the viewer, and it feels like a lazy attempt to shoehorn the character into various historical settings.The dialogue is equally cringe-worthy. It's filled with cheesy one-liners and forced attempts at humor that fall flat. The attempts to explore the themes of identity and sexuality are ham-fisted and lack nuance, reducing what could have been a thought-provoking aspect of the story into a caricature.To make matters worse, the special effects are laughably bad, resembling something out of a low-budget '80s movie rather than a modern production.In the end, this film is a disastrous attempt to reinvent a beloved character, and it fails spectacularly on every front.

In fact, this is the first time that I feel compelled to let my words be heard on the web. However, having read from other users that ""Yume"" is ""a waste of time"" and ""too personal"" to be enjoyed, I was so disappointed that I felt the right time to speak up had come.I am the first one to agree that this is not a film for everyone. It is actually far from that. Alas, in this world where the vastest majority of people feel that the necessary and sufficient condition for a film to be good is to have as much special effects as possible, ""Yume"" sadly faces no other fate than to be overlooked by almost everybody.It is those few people that might consider watching this film that have the opportunity to appreciate its full greatness. There are still many hurdles on the way, though. For many Western people, including myself, the fact that ""Yume"" orbits around Japanese legends is a big obstacle to overcome, as we are not well acquainted with their meaning. I am convinced that Kurosawa's ""Dreams"" conceal much of their true objective to us who are not familiar enough with the Japanese culture.But my advice is: forget these problems. There are thousands of other details to enjoy. From just a cinematographic point of view, Kurosawa's mastery of colour is unrivaled, and a sound reason to watch this film, yet not the only one by far. The true value of ""Yume"", in my opinion, is the use of the parabolas presented disguised as dreams to teach us a way of life. The absurdity of war. The beauty of nature. The need to preserve our environment. In summary: a praise to life. And yet, Kurosawa being old himself when he filmed his ""Dreams"", looks at death and presents it as the last station of a wonderful journey. Carpe diem, yes, but not to the point of being scared. Life will follow its course as does the river at the end of the movie, with or without us being here to enjoy it. Just be thankful for the small things in life; they are the most important. Enjoy them while you can and you will leave this existence in peace with yourself.""Yume"" is one of these small, humble things, so humble that it can be overlooked by many. It would be a waste.

I attended the world premiere of Maggie last night at the Tribeca Film Festival and I am also a huge Arnold fan. It was great seeing him perform in a different (dramatic) role. The cinematography in this film was absolutely stunning. From the location setting, the small town, old house; it was all well put together. I thought the cast was great and Arnold did a great job in his role but this film was focused on Abigail Breslin. And she stole the show. She outperformed the rest of the cast and made each viewer connected to her character very closely. Abigail had many scenes alone in this film and without giving too much away, there were times you can feel her pain and sort of understand what she was experiencing as the film progressed. Maggie really shed new light to the zombie genre because it showed intimately how a family member was deeply affected by an outbreak. A father and daughter bond filled with love and courage and the chemistry played on screen between Arnold and Abigail was fantastic. Each character showed great passion throughout the film and it was well directed by Henry Hobson, his directorial debut. I recommend this film to viewers who are interested in character development, great cinematography, a well written script, and a solid meaningful ending. Please don't come into this movie expecting The Walking Dead/ Zombieland type of action film because this isn't it. Hopefully Arnold will take on more of these roles in the future and from what we saw in Maggie, Abigail has a great career ahead of her. 9/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNzk0MTU2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDExNzMyNTE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Certainly Ronja is not The Godfather, but it's one of the best in the genre: you should have no prejudice - this movie has no age, interest or other limits. It is not a ""children movie"" as most movies sorted in ""family"" genre are, like ""Pippi Langstrumpf"", ""Madiken"" or ""Alla vi barn i Bullerbyn"" (all of them by Astrid Lindgren books). It is not a movie you have to watch because you are a grandparent who has a duty to watch TV with grandchildren. It is a movie you can watch at any age alone or with any member of your family. I watched it with my children who are from early to very late teens (and you know how at that age kids try to get as distant as they can from childish so nobody could consider them to be little children); I've never seen it before and it had no sentimental meanings to me (no memories from my childhood), but we all loved it and still, months later, laugh remembering some scenes or quotes. And I saw my wife crying as she never does watching standard tragic stories like ""Titanic"". We are not that old to be senile and back to diapers. So, if we all loved it - isn't that an example what a real family movie should be?!So please, could these two genres could somehow be distinguished?","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzMDU2NGUtN2ExNi00YmRmLTkzNWQtYWJlNmNkYzBiOGI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUxNjc5NjY@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

First, you were asked, again, to play a 'bad guy'. Second, your make-up was so awful that it was at times, impossible to see that it was actually you in this film. Even this however, could not prevent me from noticing that this script was a great big leap ahead of most of the rubbish you've recently chosen for your roles. All of your true fans know that your Tokyo destructive rampages are inspired by a single desire - to locate and destroy once and for all the Toho Productions studio, and that once you've destroyed it, your final purpose will be fulfilled. Yet, in this film, you had to pretend that you symbolize the collective guilt of the Japanses people. While this is certainly an interesting and philosophical not to mention political spin and it certainly made your unpleasant behavior tolerable for some people, I am wondering if you will ever get a great role showing your true colors - as a protector of all living things (Japanese and otherwise) - again.Your acting, and your supporting cast, even the very small hairless apes, were positively stellar in this film, and the production values were good enough to inspire me to plead with you to spare Toho from the revenge you certainly deserve for their occasional attempts to ruin your career, your public image, and your family life. Despite your bad facial makeup, you, Mosura and Kingu GidorÃÂ¢ were all shot beautifully with some of the best split screen and blue screen work I have ever seen. Although it bothered me that GidorÃÂ¢ was cast in the role of saving japan, and that he even joined that overgrown spray-painted house fly Mothra in this effort, I am certainly glad that, despite the Americanized title - something like ""Giant Monsters All Out Attack"" - was not really what this film was about. I'm glad the director allowed the characters some time to develop and to construct an interesting set of subplots between scenes of mass devastation.I don't blame you for avoiding Hollywood, especially after that film they claimed to be about you which they they hired one of your stunt doubles to do a few years ago. And this film gives reason to think there is hope for the Toho production company after all. But, the offer still stands. Retirement in Hollywood could really be a good time for you, and again, I can think of at least a few states with habits of electing famous middle-aged and older thespians of grand stature and size to public office. Besides, if you got cast in a bad role here in the USA, just imagine the popularity with which your first rampage through southern California would be received! So the prospects are unlimited here.

The problem was that, even before the casting was done for the film of Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather,"" everyone knew that whoever played the leading role was going to receive the Best Actor Oscar, irrespective of the performance. To rate Brando's performance above the performances of Caine and Olivier that year is nothing short of ludicrous. All I can say is thank God that at least Joel Grey received the best support Oscar for ""Cabaret"" that year.I first saw Anthony Schaffer's play on the London stage about two years prior to the release of the movie. The leading roles were taken by Paul Rogers and Donal Donnelly, two fine English actors who were superb in these parts. I remember thinking what a difficult thing it would be to make a film of this, but I was sure that someone would try it and make a mess of it. How wrong I was!I note that ""Sleuth"" comes up as #250 in the IMDB top 250. I recently selected my top 100 and it comes up at #55. This is a magnificent movie that keeps one on the edge of the seat for its entire length. The performances of the two leads as they play the same game a number of times is stunning. Here is the man acknowledged as perhaps the greatest actor of the 20th century, and here is the Cockney up-start Caine (famous for his ""kitchen-sink"" roles such as in ""Alfie"") matching him at every turn and often soaring above him.But in saying all this, I need to put in a plug for perhaps the finest supporting performances ever delivered.

To pay the bills, he pretends to choke on his dinner in fancy restaurants and plays off his saviour's heroism for financial gain.I think the majority of readers here are at the very least aware of the existence of Fight Club, the only other major movie aside from Choke to be based off a Chuck Palahniuk novel. Most of the people who will seek out Choke will do it mainly because of the connection to either Fight Club or the Choke novel (or both, as the case may be). Of course, I'll have to play the comparison game here, but it has to be said - Choke is a very different beast to both its source novel and its spiritual predecessor, Fight Club.Anyone who's read Palahniuk's writing will know that his books are frequently dark, very twisted and somewhat humorous. Words like ""diseased"" and ""cancerous"" come to mind. It's this same feeling that infected both the Fight Club and Choke novels and made them perverse joys to read. Palahniuk's touch even translated perfectly in David Fincher's adaptation. With Clark Gregg's adaptation of Choke, the stylish darkness is traded for a far more conventional ""quasi-independent comic"" approach. Strangely enough, this seems to suit Choke even better.After all, Choke is first and foremost a comedy. At a guess, I'd say it's roughly 80 per cent faithful to the original novel (more on that later) with a large number of jokes lifted from the novel. The laugh factor was a strange thing. On one hand, the laughs managed to stay more or less consistent, with none of the jokes falling flat. On the other hand, I personally didn't feel like anything was too funny. Everything raised a genuine chuckle but as for anything approaching ""struggling-to-breathe"" humour, there wasn't much there. It makes me wonder what's better, a comedy with consistent chuckling or sporadic bursts of hilarious moments. Not too sure.Regardless, the film manages to be an enjoyable experience. First-timer Gregg manages to handle his duties (which include writing, directing and even one very amusing bit part) with confidence, balancing comedy with drama effectively. The acting is impressive to say the least. Rockwell manages to nail Victor perfectly, yet it's Brad William Henke that manages to steal several scenes as Victor's friend Denny. Another treat is the score, which is an interesting blend of different styles.Choke not only manages to be an entertaining comedy, it also becomes a very good example of how to streamline a 300-page novel into a movie that's just shy of the 90-minute mark. The only problem with it depends on whether or not your sense of humour agrees with the film's, but if this film was already on your ""to-see"" list, that shouldn't be too much of a problem.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxMDI4MTE0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg0NDI3MQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

While it was greatly refreshing to see Gibson on screen again in EDGE OF DARKNESS and THE BEAVER after an overbearing eight year absence, GET THE GRINGO does the best of capturing everything we truly loved about Gibson's performances: charm, wit, humor, edge. The script by Gibson, director Adrian Grunberg and producer Stacey Persky is an original and tight balance of humor, edge, and danger that can very easily be considered an unofficial sequel to the theatrical cut of Gibson's cult favorite, PAYBACK. While the character of GRINGO's Driver never reveals his actual name, he possesses a lot of the same qualities as PAYBACK's Porter, including a U.S. military tattoo, a chain-smoking habit, sticky fingers, an iron jaw, and a penchant for bloodshed. Grunberg's direction is also solid with an obvious love for Sam Peckinpah paraded throughout. For those of us who endured so many years of understandable negativity towards Gibson for his personal troubles, GET THE GRINGO is the film we've long awaited. It's truly a shame this film won't be seen wide in the U.S. It would've been a better comeback vehicle than EDGE OF DARKNESS was meant to be. GET THE GRINGO practically screams, ""Remember me? I'm still here, and I still got it!""But if one thing is certain in the age of home entertainment, it is that every good film gets discovered by an audience.

The plot of this movie was just a complete mess, it kind of had a purpose for the first 15 minutes and looked like it could be a promising film but for the entire rest of the film i had no idea what was happening or why it was happening. Everything about the film just felt very weird and you couldn't like Rosamund Pike's character because of the ridiculously dumb decisions she makes for reasons that you don't understand. Just thinking back on the film there was zero character development for anyone at all for the majority of the film, it is just a series of events that seem to happen then the film moves on to another irrelevant scene and it keeps on doing this until you are bored out of your mind. The film also decides to take a very odd turn in the last act just out of nowhere. All of a sudden the film decides to throw a curveball with absolutely no setup and no foreshadowing that it just seems very out of character. The terrible writing of the plot and characters really let the film down, you cannot get behind any of the characters and everything just seems ridiculous.

What we have, however, is a convoluted mess that tries too hard to be a social satire. The premise: Jack Armstrong (Anthony Mackie), a hotshot VP at a pharmaceutical company, suddenly finds himself unemployed and in need of money. When his ex-fiancÃÂ©e-turned-lesbian Fatima Goodrich (Kerry Washington) offers him $10,000 to impregnate her and her lover Alex (the sexy Dania Ramirez), Jack realizes he could be a sexual cash cow. Next thing he knows, he's in high demand from wealthy lesbians who want children. The problem is that Lee doesn't know what he wants his film to be. Or, what the story should be. He tackles way too many issues and never tackles any of them very well.The film opens with a novel title sequence that ends with a broadside against President George W. Bush. Fair enough. Lee's bit actually works. The story then turns into some sort of diatribe against corporate greed, against the blatant excesses of the Enrons and WorldComs of corporate America. OK. Then there's also all this stuff about lesbians and impregnating them. And Jack's conscience about whether he's doing the right thing.But the film then suddenly turns into a defense of Frank Wills, the black security guard who uncovered the Watergate burglary. Lee makes a valid point that while all the players involved in the burglary and subsequent cover-up went on to have lucrative careers as statesmen, authors, speakers and radio personalities, Wills died in obscurity. A tribute to Wills is long overdue. The man was a hero. But what the heck's his story doing in this film? And in a moment that seems completely arbitrary, Lee also throws in Oliver North into the mix of Watergate figures.For a satire to work, it needs to satirize something. Frankly, I didn't know what exactly Lee was trying to send up. And, after a while, I didn't care. His movie's neither a sex comedy nor stinging social commentary. In fact, at times ""She Hates Me"" plays more like some sort of unbridled male fantasy. Not only are all the lesbians attractive, but also they want to get impregnated the old-fashioned way. The one lesbian who chooses artificial insemination fails and so has to plead with Jack to have sex with her.Subtlety has never been Lee's forte. But in films such as ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989) and ""Jungle Fever"" (1991), he somehow found a good balance between satire and social comment. Here, he does no such thing. In ""She Hate Me,"" Lee's about as subtle as a sledgehammer.What's ultimately disappointing about ""She Hate Me"" is the often-inane writing. When Fatima tells Jack she always was a lesbian, even when she was dating him, and was merely in denial, she adds, ""And I don't mean a river in Egypt."" That's how lame the dialogue is. It gets even worse, when Lee and co-writer Michael Genet give Brian Dennehy positively laughable dialogue later.The corrupt business practices of Enron and its ties to the Bush administration deserve to be told. As does a satire, if you must, of white collar crooks who get off relatively easy and wind up having hugely successful lives as a result of their crimes. But this isn't the film that does it.Lee's clever, talented and certainly socially conscious, but just seems to be tossing in every idea he had into ""She Hate Me."" Instead of being bitingly satirical about society's lopsided values, this is a mishmash of a film that is never as funny as it wants to be or as provocative as it should be.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczOTkwMDMwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU3MDYyMQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Accolades must go to the cast - Ben Mendelsohn, Bryan Brown, Rachel Griffiths (deliberately dowdy in this)and the amazing Sophie Lowe as Kate. The Flinders Ranges in South Australia also has a major role, and performs well - beautiful, remote, dangerous and overwhelming, a bit like the underlying secret which gets addressed during the course of the film.This is the story of a family secret, hidden (but not forgotten) for 20 years, and the final revelations are stark and shocking. The cinematography and editing are truly inspiring, and I was thrilled to see such a fine piece of film-making. Top credit however must go to Rachel Ward - Director, writer (adapted from the novel)- as this is her movie, and she deserves every one of the awards that this movie is sure to receive.

It is not the worst horror film ever. People who say something like that obviously have not seen enough horror films to know the worst ones. By no means is this movie a revolutionary breakthrough that will reinvigorate the horror genre, but the film does a good job at making a decent exorcism movie documentary-style.2. The video camera shaking is not that bad. Yes, it shakes, but that's the style of the movie. Get over it. If you don't like that style at all and are always made sick by it, don't see it.3. To say the ending was ambiguous and left people missing the themes of the movie and therefore a bad choice is also a bit ridiculous. If you saw the movie Inception and still loved it despite the ""ambiguous"" feeling the film left you with and the obsessive pondering over what actually happened in the last dreams sequence then you can't complain at this ending which was NO WHERE near as complex. If you take a few minutes to work it out (talk amongst your friends if need be), the ending is not ambiguous at all.4. The filmmakers themselves never claim that this is actual footage. So stop worrying about ""how they found the camera footage"" in the first place. The filmmakers made a work of fiction, and I'm sure they hope their audience understands this.I can't deal with all the critiques, but to comment on the films good qualities:It does add a few different takes on the ""classic"" form of an exorcism film such as the documentary-style, the characters, and particularly the ending.As far as scariness, you have to understand the nature of what makes a good exorcism horror and good documentary horror: the ""sluggish build up"" (as many juvenile critics have termed it) is everything. What makes these movies great is that you, for a while, forget you're in a horror movie and start to believe you're watching real events unfold. You can split hairs over how long the film needs to convince you that these people and situations are real but without it you have no movie, or no good exorcism/documentary horror film. With it's slower (I wouldn't use sluggish) beginning the film hopes to sincerely connect you with the characters and believable setups so that when bizarre events do occur you are more likely to (sincerely) accept them and be frightened by them. No, the movie was not overwhelming scary. It doesn't go for cheap jump out moments (maybe once or twice) or CGI animations of demons popping out everywhere. But it does deliver a more realistic approach to child possession than most of its predecessors, which is pretty scary.The ending is definitely a big moment for people's final judgment of the film, because it goes in such a different direction from what the rest of the film points too. But as stated before it is not ambiguous. All I will say is keep an open mind, and realize that this film though documentary-styled is still a work of fiction (again, as stated before). It took me a few moments to adjust once the ending was over, but after some thought I didn't mind the twist. Could it have been better? Definitely. Am I outraged? No. The film makers just wanted to produce something a little different than the expected exorcism ending. Perhaps the biggest upset of the ending is that it detracts from majority of the film's atmosphere of realism.If you ARE a fan of exorcism movies and movies like the Blair Witch Project or even horror movies in general, The Last Exorcism is a good watch to satisfy your boredom and keep you entertained for an hour and a half, especially if you understand and like the construct of ""sluggish build up"" and if you have a few extra bucks that you're looking to spend.If your looking for a horror movie that will revive the horror genre for our time, this isn't it. But the film isn't trying to be the next big name in horror, so my rating is based off of the intentions of the film itself. Overall, the movie did it's job in being mildly original, having great acting (considering that this is in fact a lower-budget horror movie), in staying true to the genre, and in delivering an engaging story.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc4Mjk2MjA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzMyNjQ3Mw@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Oh Lord!","Firstly, I must say I haven't read the Alatriste books, so my comments are not based at all in the classic 'book into film' translation disappointment.As a trained professional filmmaker my opinions can't be and are not based in personal taste; they actually are not opinion, but fact analysis: This film, which I really, really expected to be a very good one, specially after watching the cinema trailer (which is really good, something exceptional, as Spanish trailers go), got me shocked when I saw it on its premiere day in Spain: It is really, really bad. Why am I saying this? I'll summarize it within the supplied word allowance: The script and direction (from a technical point of view) is just plain bad storytelling. The film being just a succession of events loosely related, like scattered paintbrush strokes which just give a vague impression of a whole when seen in its entirety from a distance (too many books to condense into a single film?); and mostly poorly covered, with far too many close shots and close-ups (some of them really painful to watch) and an acute scarcity of wide coverage, in part probably due to lack of big enough period locations and sets (a not big enough budget???), and in general Diaz-Yanes shows a constant clumsiness in terms of telling through a meaningful succession of shots; apparently more interested in portraying period scenarios in a painterly manner (mostly a lÃÂ  Velazquez) than in actually telling a story.Another example of this is the scene in which the interior of a Spanish galley is shown just to tell us the character played by Unax Ugalde is to be released from his chained rowing penalty. An incredibly expensive scene which adds nothing to the film but a nice-looking moving postcard.The 10,000 extras who worked in the film were not used very wisely. While there were far too many in some Madrid street scenes, both the Breda scenes and the long shots, specially in the Spainish side coverage of the battle of Rocroi scenes showed a ludicrously small amount of extras - casualties included (they could have even multiplied digitally the number, but no - ???!).Most of the cast is both not very good but quite famous, a fact sadly usual in Spain; but to be fair, both a good deal of their dialogue and scenes and their direction were also quite bad, something which is a real handicap, kind of 'Mission: Impossible'. But not all of them rated so low: Javier CÃÂ¡mara (in the role of the Count-Duke of Olivares) was not too bad, even better was Juan Echanove, who plays the role of writer Francisco de Quevedo, and specially Eduard FernÃÂ¡ndez's performance was a fine one. Viggo Mortensen's is good as well, but his effort at adapting his Spanish accent with a harsh voice does not quite work and in some places his forced speech works against a proper intonation.The editing of the film is just plain rubbish. The story simply doesn't flow; the scenes just bump one against the previous. Though I have the suspicion it is probably about the best any editor could have made out of the material supplied and also that he probably had to follow wrong directions and clean out loads of out-of-focus shots, of which nevertheless the final cut is still well supplied. All that would exonerate the editor. You just can't cut into the film what you don't have available.Regarding the cinematography, leaving aside the usual corrected clearly underexposed shots (which an untrained eye can't detect as such), it is a mix of very good work and wrong choices: The lighting in the night battle scenes is just too clichÃÂ©d in its intense blue-hued over-lit lighting. The general dark shadowy moody style was appropriate in most scenes, but in others it is just excessive. And then, the tavern scenes are far too bright when they naturally asked for a dim atmosphere.The film's best asset is undoubtedly its art direction. A first class work with little to object if at all.But disappointment is not the worst the film raises. The saddest thing is that if the film fails at the box-office it will work against future efforts by other filmmakers in getting the industry to back ambitious high budget projects and thus it would have helped the Spanish film industry to remain at the low level in which it keeps stagnated.In the other hand, if all the hype surrounding the film and the unusually high promotion it's been given, together with the almost sure success the film will have at the next Goya Awards (the Spanish Academy Awards), results in a big box-office success; as quality is never what drives the interest in film investment, it could lead, paradoxically, to a positive change in the Spanish film industry.Let's hope it works for the best.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1MTc1MDQ2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQ3OTI2MQ@@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

As the attacks mount, she races to understand the supernatural force behind them.","115","A horror film that you will forget is a horror film for large portions of it","Based on the synopsis for 'Body Cam' I really had no idea whether I was going to enjoy this movie or not. It sounded like an interesting premise, but I very rarely enjoy supernatural elements in films. That turned out to basically be my exact thoughts on the film. I really enjoyed the realistic side of the film, but the supernatural side of things - even though it was done surprisingly well - took me away from that and had me rolling my eyes a little. It wasn't overpowering enough to stop me from quite enjoying this little hidden gem of a film however.It can be easy to forget that Mary J. Blige is actually an Oscar nominated actress. I think of her more for her music, but the fact is that she is a terrific actor when she wants to be. She was great in the lead role here - extremely likeable, never fluffed a line, and had me believing she was a cop from start to finish. Also Nat Wolff was a welcome addition to the film. Him and his brother seem to only like to do films that are quite dark in nature and have an edge to them. Generally when I see either of their names attached to a film I like to check that film out knowing it will likely be good.The film only really falls down when it stretches the odd scene out a bit too long, and also gets a little dull through the middle stages. There is a scene towards of the film that really took me off-guard by how well it was done though. Very disturbing and certainly the best thing this film had to offer. I really enjoyed 'Body Cam' and would recommend people give it a look. Its IMDb score is currently far too low.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTczZWNmZDItYTFjMi00Y2ViLTkxM2UtMDkxYTAxOWE0YTNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDk5Mzc5MQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Immediately the news of the sinking breaks, he decides that he is going to appoint himself as the chairmen of a senatorial committee to investigate the tragedy. When the ""RMS Carpathia"" arrives in New York with survivors, he proceeds to arbitrarily detain them all - reducing many to living on the streets eating from soup kitchens and huddling around bin-fires in the cold, while he plays judge and jury with the surviving crew and the White Star Line's manager director Bruce Ismay (Sam Turich). This way he can ensure he keeps his name in the papers and look like some sort of avenging angel. It's actually the papers who begin to prove the more honest of the assessors here, though, as young reporter ""Alaine Ricard"" (Fiona Dourif) quite perilously manages to get to the truth not just about what might have happened at sea that night, but of also identifying the senator's motives and the connection between US corporate interests and the likely commencement of the Great War in Europe. Karen Allen features for about two minutes as his supportive wife, thereafter this is just a really rather lacklustre television drama that I found increasingly difficult to take seriously. The interrogations by his committee are riddled with leading questions, hindsight and contradictions - to the point where anyone with the slightest of legal backgrounds would have told him to take an hike. It plays to just about every class stereotype you can imagine and even if it did have some legitimate points to make about what might have been preventable on the day and criticisms to make of the behaviour of some of those concerned, these were lost amongst the weakly written dialogue and the arrogance of the investigator. I am afraid this disappoints from start to the rather lacklustre conclusion.

I've seen many horror movies and this is definitely on the more extreme side so if you have a weak stomach then this isn't for you. However, it's brutally real in telling its story about a girl who wants to be a star and is willing to do whatever it takes to reach that goal. It's darkly comedic at times and horrifically gruesome at others. I cringed and winced plenty of times during this movie. And it's not even solely because of the graphic imagery, which is horrifying enough (but thankfully never crosses into torture porn). It's also because Starry Eyes sheds a dark light on Hollywood and on human nature itself by exploring the most vile, revolting aspects of both.The movie is heavily reliant on atmosphere, and it definitely gives off a David Lynch and Requiem for a Dream vibe throughout. It's watching someone go through a downward spiral, from quitting their job, to abandoning everything and everyone, and the filmmakers don't sugarcoat a thing. It gets genuinely disturbing and hard to watch at times, but what draws you into it in the first place and what really makes you *believe* is the performances. Alex Essoe is absolutely terrifying as Sarah. The supporting cast is surprisingly great too, and it's amazing how quickly we sympathize with Sarah and how we gradually end up sympathizing more for her friends later on. After a while it's like you're not even watching actors - the story comes to life on screen. This is a testament to everything working in harmony: the filmmakers' vision, the actors' devotion to the roles, the eerie retro electronic score, the bleak cinematography. It all comes together to create a powerful, haunting piece of art.This movie had potential to be truly groundbreaking. As I said it's brilliantly written, acted, and directed. What threw me a bit was the ending. I won't spoil anything but they take an odd turn in the final act and you'll know it when you see it. It's not even that it's bad - the movie still left me in utter shock. I just know it could've been much more effective had they gone the deeper psychological route, which is teased at for the first three quarters of the film. Regardless, the journey itself is disturbing enough that by the time the ending comes you're already speechless and exhausted from the experience. It's just that little step that could've made it a psychological masterpiece as opposed to a highly effective insight into the darkness of human ambition.Starry Eyes disturbed me. It really did. If you like Lynch-esque movies that make you think but also make you feel unnerved then you'll definitely get some chills and thrills from Starry Eyes. These filmmakers have proved enough to cement themselves on any horror fan's radar; even if you aren't into the extreme side of the genre you can appreciate what the filmmakers set out to achieve here. This is a movie that sticks with you after the credits roll. It is a wild ride for its brief runtime and certainly worth a watch for any fan of dark psychological horror.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTY1ODUyODIxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDcyMjE0MzE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This is yet another stellar movie from the tremendous class of 1994.I was absolutely enthralled by this story, so I went and read the novel it was derived from, Silas Marner by George Eliot.  It was a really good story as well, but Martin's adaptation was outstanding.  He managed to modernize the story so it could be more meaningful to new audiences, and yet still preserved the heart and soul of the story.  While the original story was good, the novel was difficult to read not just because of the time difference (it was written in 1861) but also because of Eliot's overly descriptive language, making a wonderful story fairly unapproachable to most people.For me, the most successful adaptations must start with a great story, then keep the best parts and lose the worst parts, while understanding and compensating for the differences between the mediums.  Martin's screenplay excels at this, even surpassing Darabont's outstanding adaptation for The Shawshank Redemption.The acting in the movie was very good as well.  There's just something about a gifted comedian playing a dramatic role.  Kind of like the image of a clown crying, when someone you normally associate with happiness and laughter convinces you that they're sad, there's a finer point to it, it has more impact.

Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney were very good as they always are.

Because there are so many different strands and affecting moments tangential to the central plot, one is not entirely prepared for the finale even if you are expecting it. French film is characteristically digressive, often to a fault, but here it works to splendid advantage. It also lends itself to repeat viewings.I don't think you need to have lived in occupied Europe to appreciate this wonderful film; it speaks to all of us who have lived through childhood's quickly-passing parade and know its lifelong regrets. That last image of the stone wall is emblazoned in many consciousnesses, as it is in mine.There are many interesting choices Malle makes in this film. For example, while the central subject is the Holocaust, nearly all the Germans we actually see in the film are fairly decent if nonetheless menacing types. The real villains here are almost entirely French collaborators, which was done I think to call attention to collaboration during a period when the French were dealing with the Klaus Barbie trial. [Barbie was a Gestapo officer who was aided in his work rooting out Resistance leaders by many French collaborators.] But casting French people as the heavies also suggests the central evil of prejudice and oppression is not something exclusive to one nationality, and it broadens the scope of the movie.The tender treatment Malle affords the Catholic hierarchy in the movie is unusual, too, when you see other more anti-clerical Malle efforts like ""Murmur of the Heart."" There is an unexpected sense of spirituality throughout this film, somewhat muted but there all the same.This may well stand as the cinematic masterpiece of a man who, at his best (see also ""Atlantic City"" and ""My Dinner With Andre"") was to motion pictures what his countrymen Zola and Hugo were to novels: An artist who filled his canvas with the verve and breadth of human life.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmYxOTA5YTEtNDY3Ni00YTE5LWE1MTgtYjc4ZWUxNWY3ZTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjQ5NzM@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He had written many war scripts in his day, but fully realized that the world would not be ready for the true story of WW2, (He is quoted infamously as saying that a truly realistic war picture would involve live grenades and machine guns in the theatre). As his career ended and the world changed, he decided to make a go of his life long pet project... to make a film about the REAL story of WW2, about his own experiences in the Big Red One, or The First Infantry Division.Too ahead of it's time to be appreciated during it's birth, and too dated to be appreciated in hindsight.Some of the other user comments suggest this film is inferior to modern war films. Of course this film is not at the caliber of Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers in it's war scenes. How could it? When it is of a time closer to The Green Berets (John Wayne wins The Vietnam War) then to anything that came after it. Infact I would go as far as to say that this film broke the first ground, and made films like Platoon, Hamburger Hill, and Full Metal Jacket socially acceptable, and paved the way for films like Saving Private Ryan. Sure, Apocalypse Now has better War scenes, but is so fictional in it's scripting and ""epic"" war moments that it missed the point of the soldier on the front (and is widely regarded as being unrealistic by Vietnam Vets). The Big Red One tells the story from a WW2 Vet's point of view, Sam Fuller, and is wonderfully acted by a WW2 vet, Lee Marvin. Perhaps the last film to have such credits.Sure, The Big Red One is cheesy, and harkens to a time when war films were more about the characters, then the violence. Still, there is something charming about the scripting, and Lee Marvin holds the movie together, while being surrounded by actors who were trendy on the cheap for 1979. The film also has technical inaccuracy, as in the Sherman tanks used as Panzers. However, the real strength of the film is in the script, and not in the battles. It breaks ground in it's defiance of films like the Sands of Iwa Jima. The soldier is not a clean sterile fighter for the holiest do goodynest army of all time, he is a human being locked in a battle for survival, and most importantly, he hasn't lost his sense of humor, or his libido.Regardless of it's dated, almost 70's TV movie feel, I must mention that this film was first to show D-Day in a light other than that cast by The Longest Day, and uses some very clever cinematography to illustrate the violence. Sam Fuller consciously decided to make the battles less violent, and choose to focus on the characters instead, depicted the main characters as cynical and the fallen as humorous tragically short lived figures. This film also was first to introduce words like ""replacement"", ""non-Coms"" and ""Krouts"" to the war movie dictionary. It has the entire bangalore scene from Saving Private Ryan (although merely a concept compared to SPR) and shows North Africa, Italy, France, Germany, and a concentration camp. Before this film, WW2 was only depicted in such an epic manor that Bible films are seemingly tame.THE BOTTOM LINE: This film was one of the last war pictures to emerge from the dying studio system, and is comparable in the way of battles to The Green Berets, Longest Day, etc. However it shines in the script category. and was first to show soldiers as young clumsy men, and not heroes. It attempts almost too much and that is it's strongest limitation. Still, a must see for war movie fans who can appreciate the older films. 7/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGM3MmI0ZDUtYzE1ZS00YWE4LWEzY2UtNjhiZTBiZTEyMzY1L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Few people will say this movie is ""fair."" Instead, people often call it the best movie ever made or the worst... and they mean it! Even its severest critics grudgingly admit that it's visually stunning and has perhaps the best soundtrack of the decade (""Happy Worker"" is a classic, and ""At the Closing of the Year"" is, in my opinion, the best Christmas song written in the past 30 years). It's clearly Oscar-worthy in the categories of music and set design. Most people who've seen it agree that Joan Cusack's quirky characterization is wonderful and that the vignettes provided Robin Williams with a springboard for some of the best ad libs of his career. And the story, a whimsical fable of innocence versus corruption, is as unlikely to give offense as any you can name. So, you'd expect the movie's critics to say ""I didn't care for it,"" instead of ""Everyone associated with this movie should be ashamed!""When I like something and others don't, I hesitate to say they don't ""get it,"" but in the case of ""Toys,"" it really is true. It's no coincidence that many visual references to the work of Rene Magritte keep popping up. ""Toys"" is a surrealist movie, and like any work of surrealism, it has a simple veneer over a more sophisticated message, one that defies explanation and works on the level of a dream. This movie is more ""Mulholland Drive"" than ""Willie Wonka.""Whether you will like this movie depends entirely on how your mind works. Poets will probably love it.

The project started more than 3 years ago as the crazy dream of a bunch of Swiss horror/cult film-buffs. The mission: make the first-ever Swiss exploitation movie, preferably as insane and over-the-top as humanly possible. The challenge: they didn't have any money, only a lot of devoted enthusiasm and energy.What followed is probably one of the most impressive and respectable crowd-funding campaigns in history. Via Internet and various social media channels, the ""Mad Heidi"" hype slowly but surely increased. Funds were raised via merchandising (you could even buy a cuckoo-clock) and the pre-order DVD sales of a movie that didn't exist yet! The campaign was incredibly successful, and the film was made with more than enough budget for excellent special effects, and even the involvement of a relatively well-known B-actor; - Casper Van Dien.But then came Covid-19 ... Just like everything else in the world, the release of ""Mad Heidi"" was put on hold, and the patience of the cast, crew and thousands of co-funders got tested immensely. Now, and finally, the movie had its world-premiere at the Brussels' International Fantastic Film Festival. It was a real party.Inevitably, the festive ambiance before, during and after the screening of ""Mad Heidi"" heavily influenced my experience and rating. I'm sorry for that, but it's simply impossible to get euphoric when you are surrounded by hundreds of people yodeling in a theater, wearing fake Swiss Nazi-uniforms, and drinking beer.Most importantly, though, ""Mad Heidi"" is exactly what it promised to be ever since the beginning of production; - namely a massively entertaining and absurdly eccentric exploitation movie with copious amounts of splatter, twisted humor, demented characters, self-parody, deliberately dumb quotes and catch-phrases, and non-stop vitality. The tone, style and content of the film isn't new or innovative. The plot is comparable to crowd-pleasing flicks like ""Inglourious Bastards"" or ""Iron Sky"", and the script pays tribute to approximately three dozen of cinematic treasures varying from ""The Sound of Music"" to ""Lady Snowblood"".The story is of lesser importance, but it neatly follows the structure of a textbook revenge-thriller. If I tell you Casper Van Dien stars as the tyrannical and megalomaniacal President of Switzerland, and simultaneously CEO of the only authorized company to produce and export cheese, you already know enough. He wants to obtain world-domination via genetically altered cheese, but a heroic girl from the Alps is determined to get revenge for the murder of her boyfriend and the downfall of her beloved Motherland.Of all the great fun and splendid gimmicks, what I most appreciated is how the makers wonderfully inserted every possible Swiss cliche and national symbol into their film. There's the Matterhorn and cheese bowls in the film-logo already, but everything else you could possibly associate with Switzerland features as well: idyllic mountain paths, Alp horns, cuckoo clocks, cheese fondue, watches, pocket knives, Toblerone chocolate, ... There's so much lunacy and mayhem happening that Heidi's character and her quest for revenge is even pushed to the background sometimes, which is a minor default.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQ3M2JhNjMtYjM2OC00NjllLWFlOTUtMmZjYzM4ZTNiYjhlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk0ODAyMTU@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Given the fact that the assessment of comedy is intrinsically subjective, this film is arguably laugh for laugh and sight gag for sight gag the funniest of the five (followed closely by the second of the series, the hilarious farce, `A Shot In The Dark).  In this one, former Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is about to be released from the mental hospital-- in which he has resided since being driven crazy by Clouseau-- when on the very afternoon of his hearing he is visited by none other than Clouseau himself, who has come to speak on behalf of his former boss.  Suffice to say that by the time Clouseau is through `helping,' he is driven from the premises by the relapsed, raving madman, Dreyfus.  And it's only the beginning of the inept French Inspector's antics that, before it is over, will include a trip to the Ocktoberfest, encounters with a dozen hit-men from around the world, a beautiful Russian spy named Olga (Lesley-Anne Down), a surprise Egyptian spy (who will remain nameless) and a one-man assault on a castle. 	As Laurel and Hardy proved so many times before, for every action there is a reaction; a theorem of which proof is unequivocally provided here by the relationship between Sellers and Lom.  This was the film in which Edwards and his stars not only further devised, but honed to perfection, their foolproof formula for laughs:  After the `first wave' of hilarity provided by Sellers, it is followed up-- in just enough instances to be totally effective-- by Lom's reaction to 1.)  Sellers directly (as in the first, classic scene at the mental hospital), or 2.)  Lom's reaction to Seller's antics as they are related to him by a third party.  It's a one-two punch that never fails and which, in effect, derives twice the fun from a single gag.  And it's brilliant.  But at the end of the day, it must be noted that there is one element above all else that accounts for the success of this film, and that, of course, is the Man himself, Peter Sellers. 	Sellers must be regarded as-- if not `the,' then at least one of the-- funniest actors ever to grace the silver screen.  There was no end to the ways he could make you laugh; from the subtlest expression-- an eye averted or perhaps the slight raising  of an eyebrow-- to the broadest slapstick, it was all within his personal domain, and he was the Master.  Physically, practically all he had to do to get a laugh was show up; consider the scene in which he arrives at the hospital to visit Dreyfus:  As he saunters across the lawn of the vast grounds surrounding the buildings, a croquet mallet and ball lying to one side catches his eye; there is just the slightest hesitation in his step, the subtlest change of expression in his eyes and the merest inclination of the head.  And there, in that briefest of moments upon the screen, you know-- beyond the shadow of a doubt-- what is about to transpire.  And you're right; a moment later Clouseau has the mallet in his hand and his foot on the ball, and even as it's happening-- just as you knew it would in that split second before it did-- he has you on the floor laughing.  That was the gift-- and the genius-- of Peter Sellers.  Was every film he made a classic?  A great film?  Of course not; but you would be hard put to find a single performance of his, even in a bad film (Like 1970's `There's A Girl In My Soup'), that did not embody that unique spark that defined him.  It was certainly alive in his portrayal of Clouseau (possibly the definitive Seller's character), and in retrospect, what a shame it seems that there were only five `Panther' movies ever made.  But so it is, and shall ever be. 	The supporting cast includes Burt Kwouk (as the ever faithful and attacking manservant, Cato), Andre Maranne (Francois), Colin Blakely (Alec Drummond), Leonard Rossiter (Inspector Quinlan), Richard Vernon (Dr. Fassbender), Briony McRoberts (Margo) and Michael Robbins (Jarvis).  A funny movie that showcases one of Cinema's truly unique and funny actors, `The Pink Panther Strikes Again' is a side-splitting, fun movie you can watch over and over and never grow tired of.  The best of the series, it stands as a glowing tribute to the comedic genius of Peter Sellers.  I rate this one 10/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDU4MGJhMzQtM2ZmZi00NzlmLTkwNWMtZWNiN2I2NDk0ZGE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Cloverfield, for me, remains at the top of the list, while the PA films are way down.Apollo 18 isn't far from the bottom, either. The premise was intriguing, and I genuinely expected some sort of development in the genre - something like a cross between Blair Witch and Alien. What I got was 90 minutes of predictability and disappointment. The sense of isolation and claustrophobia was well done, but little else. I felt some sense of a tension build-up for perhaps a half-hour - but then it dissipated once the nature of the 'horror' became apparent.I came away feeling that here was a great opportunity missed.

If criticised in terms of, say, similarity to ""the Firm"", or ""yet another cyber thriller"", then you really missed the point. The message is pretty blunt, and guaranteed to anger a certain large corporation. (This is not an anti-corporate movie, it is anti- a ~particular~ corporation, and if you can't guess which one, maybe you should go back to exploring the Kalahari or whatever you've been doing for the last ten years.) This corporation has been known to spend extraordinary resources on PR (including, for example, bribing journalists and college professors), so almost certainly some of the comments on this message board will be produced by that corporation and should be read in that light.Second, while murder is a bit over the top, pretty well all the other crimes committed by the large corporation in this movie are things of which the real corporation has been seriously accused, been found to be planning, or in some cases, convicted; yet in every case managing to escape with fines or compensation payments much smaller than the profits they made from the crime. That is why we hate them so much, and why this movie was made. It's also obvious why the motif of murder was added: some of the technical details of why their actions are pure evil are difficult for a non-techie to understand, so to make the movie accessible to a wider audience, they added a more blatant crime (plus pyrotechnic special effects, a tense chase scene, love interest, etc).Thirdly, it is not a futuristic movie, it is present day; nothing in this movie is more than about 1 or 2 years in the future, at most, and most of it is happening now or happened several years ago.Fourthly, technical realism: while some of the tech stuff is rubbish (hey, it's a movie!), the effort put into realism is dramatically good compared to information technology in any other movie I have ever seen. When we see IP's, they are actual IPs, but martian (I guess they don't want geeks going home and whois-ing them!), the code is all real code: some HTML, some C++, real scripting, but mostly VB (a language the certain large corporation is known to use a lot). The algorithms they discuss improving are even algorithms the product would really require! Not only that, the product is frighteningly similar to the large corporation's actual current development path!So, if you walked away from this movie thinking ""just for geeks"" or ""totally unrealistic"", you need to give yourself a good hard slap, wake up and see what is really going on in the world around you. This movie was about as unrealistic and irrelevant as ""All the President's Men"".Oh, by the way, I better say that all the above comments are only my personal opinions, in case they try to sue me, because they do do stuff like that.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2VjZjdiYzYtOGU1Yy00NWZmLWEyOTUtM2QzMDlkYmRlYmM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

With the interviews and guests featured, there are some guests that were interesting but some guests that didn't really impacted the discussions and felt a bit awkward since their discussions and interviews felt a bit cringeworthy and slightly got on my nerves. With the movie being the runtime of 168 minutes, the pacing is pretty uneven and certain scenes felt unnecessary. I understand the heart and passion of what BeyoncÃÂ© is trying to communicate but I just wasn't emotionally connected with it. I gave this one a watch since I like to give all kinds of movies a chance but just like Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, it's not for me.Overall, BeyoncÃÂ© is one talented singer and actress/filmmaker but I didn't emotionally connect with the documentary. I do recommend it for BeyoncÃÂ© fans tho.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDBhODM5MjMtNTdkYy00ZTIxLWEwNWYtZTA1MDBkYjAzZjJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY0Njc2MTUx._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

No longer content to keep the plays bound to the historical eras in which they are set, many an adapter has chosen to transport the plots and dialogue virtually intact to either a completely modern setting or a strange never-never land that combines elements of the past with elements of the present.  In just the last few years, we have seen this done with `Romeo and Juliet,' `Richard the Third' (albeit this one made it only as far as the 1940's) and even Kenneth Branagh's `Hamlet,' which, although also not exactly contemporary in setting, did at least move that familiar story ahead in time several centuries.  Now comes `Titus,' a film based on one of Shakespeare's earliest, bloodiest and least well known plays, `Titus Andronicus,' and, in many ways, this film is the most bizarrely conceived of the four, since it creates a world in which - amidst the architectural splendors of ancient columned buildings - Roman warriors, dressed in traditional armor and wielding unsheathed swords, battle for power in a land disconcertingly filled with motorcycles and automobiles, pool tables and Pepsi cans, punk hair cuts and telephone poles, video games and loud speakers.  The effect of all this modernization may be unsettling and off-putting to the Shakespearean purist, yet, in the case of all four of these films, the directorial judgment has paid off handsomely.  Not only does this technique revive some of the freshness of these overly familiar works, but these strange, otherworldly settings actually render more poetic the heightened unreality of Shakespeare's dialogue.  Plus, in all honesty, Shakespeare's plays are themselves riddled with so many examples of historical anachronisms that the `crime' of modernization seems a piddling one at best.Those unfamiliar with `Titus Andronicus' may well be caught off guard by the ferocious intensity of this Shakespearean work.   Moralists who decry the rampant display of unrestrained violence in contemporary culture and look longingly back to a time when art and entertainment were supposedly free of this particular blight may well be shocked and appalled to see Shakespeare's utter relishment in gruesomeness and gore here.  In this shocking tale of betrayal, vengeance and rampant brutality, heads, tongues and limbs are lopped off with stunning regularity and it is a measure of Julie Taymor's skill as a director and her grasp of the shocking nature of the material that, even in this day and age when we have become so inured and jaded in the area of screen violence, we are truly shaken by the work's cruelty and ugliness.  Yet, Taymor occasionally injects scenes of daring black comedy into the proceedings, as when Titus and his brother carry away the heads of his sons contained in glass jars while his own daughter, who has had her own hands chopped off in a vicious rape, carries Titus' own dismembered hand in her teeth!  There are even meat pies made out of two of Titus's enemies to be served up as dinner for their unwitting mother.   Thus, even though we can never take our eyes off the screen, this is often a very difficult film to watch.`Titus' is filled with elements of character, plot and theme that Shakespeare would enlarge upon in later works.  It includes a father betrayed by his progeny (`King Lear'), a Moorish general (`Othello'), a struggle for political power (`Julius Caesar' among others) and - a theme that runs through virtually all Shakespeare's tragedies - the need for revenge to maintain filial or familial honor.  Anthony Hopkins is superb as Titus, capturing the many internal contradictions that plague this man who, though a beloved national hero and military conqueror, finds himself too weary to accept the popular acclamation to make him emperor - a decision he will live to rue when his refusal ends up placing the power directly into the hands of a rival who makes it his ambition to bring ghastly ruin upon Titus' family.  Titus is also a man who can, without a twinge of conscience, kill a son he feels has betrayed him and disembowel a captive despite the pleas of his desperate mother, yet, at the same time, show mercy to the latter's family, humbly refuse the power offered him, and break down in heartbroken despair at the executions of his sons and the sight of his own beloved daughter left tongueless and handless by those very same people he has seen fit to spare.  Jessica Lange, as the mother of the captive Titus cruelly dismembers, seethes with subtle, pent-up anger as she plots her revenge against Titus and his family.Visually, this widescreen film is a stunner.  Taymor matches the starkness of the drama with a concomitant visual design, often grouping her characters in studied compositions set in bold relief against an expansive, dominating sky.   At times, the surrealist imagery mirrors Fellini at his most flamboyant.The fact that this is one of Shakespeare's earliest works is evident in the undisciplined plotting and the emphasis on sensationalism at the expense of the powerful themes that would be developed more fully in those later plays with which we are all familiar.  At the end of the story, for instance, many of the characters seem to walk right into their deaths in ways that defy credibility.  We sense that Shakespeare may not yet have developed the playwright's gift for bringing all his elements together to create a satisfying resolution.  Thus, it is the raw energy of the novice - the obvious glee with which this young writer attacks his new medium - that Taymor, in her wildly absurdist style, taps into most strongly.  `Titus' may definitely not be for the faint of heart or the weak of stomach, but the purely modern way in which the original play is presented in this particular film version surely underlines the timelessness that is Shakespeare.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE0ZWY5N2UtZTlmMy00NGIwLTg4MGItMzkzYTY5OTYyOWIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Mike Kirby picks two teams of crack Green Berets for a mission in South Vietnam. First off is to build and control a camp that is trying to be taken by the enemy the second mission is to kidnap a North Vietnamese General.","158","About as viable as most Vietnam war movies","No, seriously. ""The Green Berets"" is about as viable and creditable as ""The Boys in Company C"" or ""Casualties of War"". It's hard to find a Vietnam war movie that DOESN'T come full of distortions based on the film makers political agendas; it's just this time ""The Green Berets"" comes from the pro-involvement side.We've heard the negatives about this movie, and most of them are basically correct but there are a few things to say that, if not positive, put the movie in a less negative light.First, this isn't your usual piece about 19 year old conscripts being called up to fight in a war they don't understand. The real Special Forces are career professionals who have very high standards of training and discipline. ""The Green Berets"" isn't a movie about your average grunt; it's about commandos and a lot of the training, tactics and equipment is accurate for the time. The experience of the special forces in Vietnam was widely different from line conscripts; and they won a lot of victories.Second, it was a bold move to make a movie about the Vietnam war whilst it was still going on. The movie was made shortly before the Tet Offensive of 1968 when the initiative was still with the US and South Vietnamese forces. This is a Vietnam war movie from the early part of the war...something ""Platoon"" falls down on is depicting the unit in a state of disorganisation, with the usual drug taking and indiscipline scenes that have become clichÃÂ©, in 1967 when the reality was that discipline and cohesion in the field in '67 was a lot tighter. Stone depicts events that would not become common in front line troops until '69-'70. Yes, I know he served a tour of duty over there but a number of his fellow veterans have called his depiction of events into question.Third, the early part of the movie with the relationships between US Special Forces officers and ARVN counterparts is fairly well done. The SF had been present in Vietnam from '62 onwards and by '67-'68 had built up a good working relationship with ARVN Ranger units (the only South Vietnamese army units that were well trained and led).Now the pine tree issue. Well, I hate to break it to people but not all of Vietnam is palm trees and jungle. In the area of Cochinchina just north of Saigon and into the hilly Montangnard country, there are a lot of deciduous and evergreen trees. I was surprised to find this when doing research on the US 25th Infantry Division and finding a lot of their patrol area wasn't in jungle but hilly woodland. Pine trees maybe stretching things a little bit though but it's not impossible.The politics. Yes, the Duke is on the right wing campaign trail but other film makers have used the Vietnam war to promote the liberal left agenda so I don't get why that is acceptable and an alternative view that doesn't conform to that is inherently wrong. The scene at the beginning of the movie has Aldo Ray explaining how China, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union were sending aid to North Vietnam...so Oliver Stone's assertions that the VC were self-liberating and proudly defiant are deeply wrong. The VC and NVA were tools of a communist regime that were being heavily supplied and subsidised by other Communist regimes. I'm not advocating that the US's involvement in a war in Vietnam was right, just that people understand the involvement of other nations as well.For those who think this movie is bad because it doesn't depict American atrocities, drug taking and insubordination like other Vietnam war movies have merely bought into another set of falsehoods. This goes back to my original point; ""The Green Berets"" isn't particularly realistic...but then again, neither are most other movies about that war.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmQzMzlkNGItZGYyNi00ZWRiLTk2YmQtNTc5ZmMzMzc3ZmQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzg1ODEwNQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In Anne of a Thousand Days it's told from the point of view of Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII and mother of the infant child who became Elizabeth I. Anne Boleyn, a high spirited young lass of 18, catches Henry VIII's eye at court. One of his previous dalliances was with her older sister Mary and that paid off well for the Boleyn family. Father Tom sees riches and glory even more and persuades her to really keep the king panting. Anne succeeds all too well. Henry divorces Catherine of Aragon and marries Anne. But all he begats is another daughter. And Henry still wants a son and he's got an eye on another. It all ends tragically for the Boleyn family.It's important to remember that as the film opens Henry VIII having caught sight of Anne at his court denies permission for her to marry some young lord whom she is in love with and vice versa. Had he looked elsewhere, had he moved on, all this might never have come to pass.Anne of the Thousand Days took 21 years to come to the screen. It ran on Broadway for a year in 1948-1949 and starred Rex Harrison as Henry VIII. Richard Burton joins a great list of actors who've portrayed Henry VIII on the screen. Probably the young Charles Laughton did him best, but Burton is certainly fine.Genevieve Bujold in her screen debut is a stunning and fetching Anne, too fetching for her own good. Poor kid though, in other than a monarchist society that was becoming more absolute during Henry's reign, she'd have married the man of her dreams and lived happily ever after.Anthony Quayle is a fine Cardinal Woolsey though I prefer Orson Welles in A Man for All Seasons. Michael Hordern as Thomas Boleyn destroys more than one member of his family through his own ambition.Irene Papas makes a tragic Catherine of Aragon. By all accounts Catherine was a pious woman who had incredible rotten luck with her pregnancies. Only daughter Mary survived who grew up to be the Queen known as Bloody Mary. She settled some accounts when she became Queen.I think the best supporting portrayal is that of John Colicos as Thomas Cromwell. This Cromwell was the great uncle of the more well known Oliver Cromwell. Oliver has his supporters and detractors, but I've never seen a good word in any history books about Uncle Tom. Colicos has him pegged just right as a serpentine intriguer. By the way after the period of this film is over, Thomas Cromwell made one too many intrigues and got on Henry VIII's wrong side. People usually didn't live long after that and Cromwell was no exception.When he wrote Anne of the Thousand Days, Maxwell Anderson grew up in a society of law. I think a fine appreciation of that fact comes into the moral of the story. Even an absolute monarch has to obey laws or no one is safe. Until Henry VIII was off this mortal coil, no one was.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTBiYWU5NmUtOTZkZi00NzU5LWFhYWQtMzM1ZjhjZTA1ZWQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Barbara Novak (Renee Zellweger) has written a book called ""Down With Love"" convincing woman that they don't need a man or love or sex to succeed and be happy with themselves. Womanizer Catcher Block (Ewan McGregor) is determined to prove her wrong.This is many things--an affectionate remake of those silly Doris Day/Rock Hudson movies; a sweet sendup of them at the same time; a perfect example of 1960s sex comedies with a 2000s twist; a huge barrel of laughs for film buffs with its perfect remake of a 1960s film and an examination of sexual mores and stereotypes of the 1960s.The movie look like a Day/Hudson movie right down to the fashions Zellweger wears, the VERY colorful sets, the obviously painted backdrops from penthouse apartments and the crappy back projection in cars. There's also a hysterical (and very dirty) use of split screen during a phone conversation between Zellweger and McGregor. The movie even opens with the old Cinemascope logo used in films of that era!The cast is right on target--Zellweger and McGregor give their all to the performances--they wink at the audience all the time...but not TOO much. David Hyde Pierce (doing Tony Randall) and Sarah Paulson are also very funny with the dreaded best friends role. The only real problem is the script. It is sharp and funny but occasionally bogs down and some of the twists are too obvious.Still, I enjoyed it. The casual moviegoer will probably hate this--unless you get the inside jokes all throughout the film you'll think you're watching a badly dated sex comedy. But it's not--it's a parody and an affectionate sendup. This will be most appreciated by film buffs or students.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY0OTMyNmMtODEwZS00ZWJiLWI0ZjctNmNiNmJjMTMzYWM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

They have apparently lost touch with the fever dreams of cinema, the world of Cocteau and all the other European masters, the flights of imagination that made us buffs in the first place. I read here with wonder about a film that could not decide on its genre -it wasn't a neat, spoon-fed package designed to pull the viewer's strings on cue. You know: John Avildsen meets Stallone, for that first crucial bout. No wonder Lina Wertmuller, the supreme filmmaker of the '70s, is virtually forgotten, well -at least no longer appreciated today.I will leave the My Weekly Reader world of writing synopses to others: IMDb seems intent on creating a legion of retards scribbling 1000s of idiotic play-by-play capsules, or strings of nonsensical ""Keywords"" -watch the damn movie yourself! This film adaptation of Piero Chiara's novel set in 1946 on Italy's coast with Switzerland is carefully tailored as a vehicle for its iconic trio of stars, all performing in a quasi-deadpan fashion that weaves a subtle charm. Ugo (who starred memorably in another Chiara adaptation Come Have Coffee With Us) is perfect as the ne'er-do-well, Abyssinian war vet who attaches himself like a barnacle to our previously freewheeling protagonist (a device familiar in later films like Bill Murray in What About Bob?); Patrick Dewaere, a vagabond, former conscientious objector during WW II, is the audience surrogate with a girl in every port, conjuring up a pure naif right out of Orson Welles' Isak Dinesen film The Immortal Story. Completing the topline is of course Ornella Muti -the face that still is the most breathtaking in modern Cinema, on a par with the Garbos, Oberons and Hepburns (both) from the classic age. Her pivotal character is underwritten, but I believe that is on purpose, as it adds to the mystery and fable-like quality of the piece.What's wrong with a film daring to challenge the viewer, scene by scene, to determine for oneself the level of seriousness implied? The best movies are ones that have enough degrees of freedom, not only for the characters but for the audience as well, to be open-ended and open to INDIVIDUAL reactions. Stop making All-Time lists and complaining about which film is in or out of IMDb's Top 250 -think for yourself people! Manipulating the mood is not Dino's forte -rather he concentrates here on creating a mismatched male combo worthy of his classic '60s work: The Easy Life and a film I always give him credit for (though he apparently was only a helper), The Success, with Ugo giving Gassman a run for his money and Dewaere a perfect correlative to Trintignant.I saw The Bishop's Bedroom in an English-dubbed version, and the performances were universally strong enough to surmount that technical drawback. Armando Trovaioli's score is just right, even including what I can only describe as Ornella's ""masturbation leitmotif"" - a charming and evocative little recurring theme. The genius Franco Di Giacomo, who has done classic work for Argento and Bertolucci, captures the Lake Maggiore locations beautifully and timelessly -it should be noted that he shot Muti's wonderful debut film in 1970.The point here is that Italy was cranking out great films like this one ROUTINELY in the '70s: the works of prolific helmers like Bolognini, Scola, Monicelli plus many young Turks; it all came to a crashing halt circa 1983 when the local actors' union won a victory at long last mandating direct sound dialogue recording for cinema. This overdue update of technique singlehandedly killed Italian creativity just as surely as CGI has killed the wonder of Harryhausen stop-motion animation in Hollywood of late -all in the name of ""progress"". Sure, Nicchetti, Troisi, Amelio, Moretti and later Salvatores and Tornatore brought a bit of New Wave to the Boot but the factory system with its glittering stars was dead. Laura Morante can only make so many movies before she needs a rest! The final irony is that Italy's Gower Gulch equivalents, aka Joe D'Amato and a dozen Z-directors of the Quentin Tarantino slumming brigade, have their junk lovingly adored by today's so-called film buffs who ignore the true maestros.While watching The Bishop's Bedroom I wondered what Hollywood director could pull this off so effortlessly? Welles came to mind immediately, as did the greatest of all transplants Billy Wilder. His unsung Avanti was a similar classic made in the '70s, but by the time he got to Marthe Keller in Fedora the touch was gone. Perhaps a reincarnated Mitchell Leisen -my all-time favorite from the Paramount stable, could have made it work.I had the distinct privilege of interviewing Sophia Loren in NYC 20 years ago anent a tribute at MoMA to Vittorio De Sica. I remember asking her which filmmakers she admired the most, apart from those (De Sica & Ponti) who had shaped her career, and she immediately replied Dino Risi, citing his creativity and urbanity -in a word, class.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTZjODUyMjQtOTI1OC00OGY3LWJlYmMtYWFhNmQ0Mjc4MDRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The action hero is played by a French actor Alban Lenoir I have never heard of, who manages to play the role just as well as Matt Damon, Liam Neeson, or Keanu Reeves would have played had they acted in this movie.I give it 9/10. If I were the movie editor, some scenes could have been cut out and were not necessary, to reach a wider audience. Other than that, most of the characters were well played; the action scenes were done very well; the script was clever with an appropriate overlay of effective music soundtrack.Honestly surprised by how good this movie was. I watched it with a low expectation, so just pretend that you have not read my review, don't know anything about this movie, and watch it with no expectation or idea about the movie.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTc0YjE3YjktNzQ0Yi00MTYyLTg3ZDMtNzJmN2QyNzgxNWRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI0MDEyNTQz._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

""Who the hell is Ivan?""","There are some movies that, no matter how good the translation, are just impossible for a particular audience to get. This is why I think most of the American audience wasn't be able to get into WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN. After directing the rather weak and disappointing drama/thriller LAW OF DESIRE, Spanish director Pedro Almodovar returned to screens in his full glory with this wonderful Academy Award-nominated screwball comedy.Pepa (Almodovar regular Carmen Maura) works as an actress for TV commercials and dubbing of foreign films. Her lover Ivan (Fernando Guillen), who shares the same job, decides to leave her one day for unknown reasons, leading Pepa to assume he left with his wife Lucia (Julieta Serrano), who was recently released from the mental hospital. But after a while, Pepa realizes Lucia thinks the exact opposite, and that Ivan left for an unknown third woman. While on her quest to find this third woman, Pepa has to deal with her nervous friend Candela (Maria Barranco) who recently found out her boyfriend is a wanted terrorist and Carlos, (Antonio Banderas) Ivan's son whose annoying fiancÃÂ© ends up getting accidentally knocked off by a rather lethal gazpacho.Going any further with this film's plot would be unfair since most of the humor is delivered from it's many twists and turns. Almodovar was able to write a script so sharp with so many colorful characters and situations that the entire thing goes down with pure laughter. But is everyone laughing?That brings me to the answer as to why many people didn't find this funny at all. If you don't speak or understand Spanish, (or some other language that comes from Latin) you won't be able to get this film as much as others. There is a reason why so many American comedians are never able to make it overseas: Humor is simply not international. The rumored but thankfully never completed American remake of this would have never worked. The performances for example: To people who understand the language, you can tell when the characters are being ironic, sarcastic, goofy, or serious. I don't think you can do that very well when English is your first language. So the users that have been complaining about ""flat"" performances might be already explained.Almodovar has been accused of being a feminist, and this movie might be the main reason. I don't quite agree with that because WOMEN doesn't really leave strong message. If it does, I know few people who would actually care for it because this movie is hilarious. Every single character in these 90 minutes of absurdity gets well-balanced and get enough amount of time to shine: The MAMBO TAXI driver for example, turns out to be one of the funniest elements. The scenes all by themselves are already OK, but the frequency that they happen make them somehow even funnier. And the first-rate acting gets a big plus in my book. Everyone here is perfect (including a very scary way Almodovar coaches a good performance out of Antonio Banderas) with the true stand-out being Carmen Maura as over-the-top neurotic Pepa. It is a shame this was Maura's last collaboration with Almodovar.But WOMAN's style is also not to be ignored: Most of the movie is set inside Pepa's apartment, which is put to good use. It is an amazing then-futuristic-looking retro set that with it's sitcom-like camp and artificial looking painted backgrounds becomes almost a character itself. Cinematographer Jose Luis Alcaine's camera is always up to interesting moves: There is the tracking shot of Pepa's feet as she walks in circles waiting for her call, or the reflection take from the answering machine. The work with colors is equally stunning, with the main colors being yellow and blue, and Pepa's red dress ""over coloring"" the environments around her for most of the time. You could freeze frame almost every interior shot of WOMEN... and stare at it for a while.I can't really recommend this movie enough, as much as hard it is to review comedies. Reviewing a comedy is a tough call since it depends on weather you found the material funny or not. I have seen this over ten times and I always laugh at certain moments which I don't want to spoil. Let's just say the Jehovah's testimony and the TV commercial are the parts that always get me. I certainly did enjoy WOMEN... more than any other comedy I have ever seen.(5/5)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTllMmVkY2ItYTc4NC00M2MwLTkwOWEtODcwNjY0Zjc2ZjYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcwOTQzOTYy._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Dirk's one liners are cornier than extremely corny corn, and the actor playing Dirk is obviously overweight and out of shape. However, this means that the fights within the film are some of the funniest martial arts scenes ever committed to film as poor old Dirk struggles to lift his leg above his waist. Most of the actresses in the film are porn stars, and spend the movie swoonig over Dirk and his burly chum Victor. I thoroughly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys a good laugh.

It is a small film (78 min) made with a small budget about some small people. But their smallness doesn't stop them from dreaming the impossibly big - rob the Bank of England! In fact it is this very smallness & unobtrusiveness that gives Alec Guinness & Stanley Holloway - bank clerk & artist respectively - their chance. The film, told in an intelligent flashback, is divided into 3 segments. First is the plotting. A mild mannered bank clerk meets a minor artist. Both want to get out of their seedy Lavender Hill boarding house & nondescript existance. Both look past their glory days. Yet together they have the opportunity to pull off a brilliant crime.Then comes the heist. A surprisingly simple operation perfectly (almost!) executed. Finally the escape - getting the gold outside the country into the 'continental blackmarket'. Alas, the movie being made in the good old days when crime didn't pay, our heroes must suffer. But by then they have given us enough joy & adventure for us to forgive their one tragic slip.This is definitely one of the best comedies Ealing studios made in the '50s (my other favourite is the vastly underrated 'Hue & Cry' where Alistair Sim gives a typical quirky performance & the tipsy 'Whiskey Galore'). Holloway & Guinness acted in many of them. They usually played very stiff upper British lip polite, eccentric, but excitable characters. In this movie they decide they are familiar enough to ask each other their first names only after they have robbed a bank together! When Holloway realises they can pull it off, his face is hidden in the shadows as he slowly tells Guinness, 'Thank God Holland, we are both honest men' - a line which I think summarises the entire movie.The reason this movie is so amusing even today is that it is very tightly scripted (Tibby Clark won an Oscar for his effort) & brilliantly realised by the ensemble cast. As far as caper films go this has half the gadgetry of 'Entrapment' but twice the fun.This is the 3rd time I am seeing this movie & I enjoyed it as much as I did the first time.

Scripted by Gene Roddenberry it focuses on the strange happenings taking place at a California high school. To better understand this film, you need to know more about Roger Vadim. He was by all accounts a unrepentant womanizer. He wrote not just one, but two books concerning his love affairs with Brigitte Bardot, Catherine Deneuve, Annette Atroyberg, and Jane Fonda. The filmmaker practically invented the modern day sex film in 1956 with And God Ceated Woman. In 2005, Jane Fonda went public with allegations claiming that Vadim forced her to have threesomes with other women. Director Roger Vadim obviously loved women. The way the camera takes in the female form in this film shows that this guy truly enjoyed this cast of beautiful high school girls who are dropping out of school in the most unfortunate manner: they are being murdered.ÃÂ The first body is found by student Ponce. He discovers the nude body in the boy's washroom.ÃÂ After discovering the body we are introduced to the detective assigned to the case as well as an amoral guidance counselor named Tiger (played by Rock Hudson) who also happens to be sleeping with his students in his office.ÃÂ  The investigation goes and we discover that the murdered girls happened to be sleeping with Tiger.ÃÂ Despite of all the heat pressure placed on him, Tiger doesn't seem worried that he'll get caught. He continues coaching the football team, eventually setting Ponce up with a sexy new teacher (Angie Dickinson), and of course carrying on affairs with the students.ÃÂ  In his autobiography, Vadim recalled the casting of the students in Pretty Maids All in a Row: ""...I had auditioned over two hundred boys and about the same number of girls. Most of the girls who applied in the roles of high school alumni were aspiring actresses, though some were local students who merely found the whole thing amusing."" For a man recovering from love sickness (Jane Fonda had just divorced Vadim), this succession of young teenage and college age beauties was intoxicating. Vadim specifically ordered the wardrobe department to dress the girls in micro skirts and tight fitting shirts. Notably, a good portion of them aren't wearing bras. Vadim films these young ladies, many of which appear to be underage, in a method that is so unapologetically sexual that you'll soon understand why this film will likely never appear on DVD. With pedophilia being such a hot topic in today's society, no film company wants to risk being accused of exploiting minors by releasing this on DVD. With its nonstop leering shots of teenage body parts and seemingly giddy portrayal of sexual relationships between adults and children, does Pretty Maids All in A Row seem like a celebration of pedophilia? Uh, the correct term is 'ebephophilia' which means 'love of adolescents'. I guess it's a matter of opinion. When I first viewed this film as a teen, the director's constant zooming in on the breasts and buttocks of female high school students was a bit shocking, but had a point to it. I mean, high school is a particularly sexualized place being that many students are entering in relationships for the first times in their lives. Then I read a movie review about how Pretty Maids All in A Row may have been the most widespread female-kiddie-porn film ever seen. The slow, misty shots of the braless pubescent girls in their micro skirts were far too prevalent to be incidental. When I saw this movie again, this time in my late 20s, I had no problem understanding the reviewer's point of view. For example, the opening scene of this movie consists of a closeup of a pair of butts belonging to two female classmates of Ponce. These two, who look barely 18, show up randomly during this movie, and every scene they are in, the camera is fixated so closely on their mini skirts that it's laughable. I can find no reason for so pointlessly including these two girls in the movie other than for the director to showcase their gorgeous bodies with series of gratuitous shots of their crotches and rears. It seems all quite juvenille. Still, I don't think anyone should not see this film just because director Vadim can't go two minutes without fetishizing a sea of young female bodies. To better understand all the blatant voyeurism directed towards these girls, remember that this is an American movie made with a European mentality. The European school of film-making seems to approach the entire feminine image in a different sense than the Americans do; the female body is perceived to be a work of art in itself, that it is graceful, elegant, beautiful and sensual, an aesthetic object with erotic power. Presenting it in the proper manner makes one marvel instead of blushing and turning away--that seems to be the attitude this director takes, and it causes the frequent nudity in the film to be not so much dirty, obscene, and debaucherous, as being instead a presentation of a thing of beauty. The acting in Pretty Maids is first-rate. The cast is by far the film's strongest asset. These are all truly courageous performers, and the acting is so good, it's scary. The standouts are probably Rock Hudson and John David Carson. Not surprisingly, Telly Savalas as a Kojak-style detective steals every scene he is in. Angie Dickinson is great, but I was distracted by her aesthetic qualities. Pretty Maids is a good movie that has quite a few shocking moments. It's quite implausible and uneven, but I recommend seeing it. It's one of those movies where you just HAVE to see it, you know? Not because it's some great masterpiece of cinema, but because there's a lot there to talk about. Check it out.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2U1NzljOWQtMjg0OC00N2RkLThlNDUtODNjZGU2MzJmZjljL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It all boils down to one basic idea: ""This movie isn't enough like other movies I like."" Professional reviewers and users alike miss the boat on these movies because they want them to fit in a neat little package. You'll hear a lot about how they didn't feel the movie worked as a straight comedy, or straight drama, or that mixing biblical jokes with more adolescent jokes doesn't work. They are missing the point. This is not meant to be a single genre, or even really a mix of genres, instead it is an examination of characters, ideas, and themes.Unlike many other movies, ""Don Verdean"" (and ""Gentleman Broncos,"" for that matter) is not looking to work as a whole, indeed these movies reject the idea of balance and chemistry as proscribed by mainstream films. Instead, DV is about about the details. Each moment of the movie has been engineered, largely without a thought for the other moments. In the Hess world, if something is interesting that's reason enough to include it, regardless of how it fits together with other pieces.It's not inherently worse than other films (in fact, you'll see tremendous talent in the film-making, the acting, and the script); it's just a completely different approach.

Her character is defined as somewhat naive, but she is guided through her sexuality phase with the help of Tory Skinner (wonderfully played by Patrice Donnelly). Whether the two characters are lesbian or not is beside the point, what ""PERSONAL BEST"" tries to deal with is the hardship of having a relationship at a trying time in your life. In this case, both Chris and Tory are competing for a place in the Olympic Team and they both help each other emotionally and physically to achieve their goals.The two girls both deal with sexual confusion which distracts them on and off the field. Their coach is played by Scott Glenn who plays a hard and despicable character who 'pushes' them too hard to achieve their personal best.""PERSONAL BEST"" is filled with unnecessary nudity including countless scenes inside a sauna where you get to see young female athletes baring all. There are also several explicit sex scenes involving Chris and Tory which would probably not be suitable for younger children. One questionable scene involves Chris and a male athlete/temporary love interest in a bizarre toilet scene that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie - but other than that, the rest of the film is quite inspirational.When the movie isn't trying to be serious, there are some comedic moments including a scene where Chris asks Tory to 'pull her finger'. Another thing ""PERSONAL BEST"" successfully achieves is building a story around a 'lesbian relationship' without delving into silly stereo-types and clichÃÂ©'s that spoiled other films of the same time (ie. ""WINDOWS"" and ""THE LONELY LADY"").When it all boils down to it, what drove Chris and Tory to achieve their personal best was not endless training and their physical attributes, but their love and friendship for each other which was something that would probably last forever. ""PERSONAL BEST"" is a film about athletics and it is also a love story.Yes, Mariel Hemingway has starred in a lot of trash (ie. ""LIPSTICK"", ""SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE"", ""BAD MOON"") - but it is ""PERSONAL BEST"" which I remember her the most for. Patrice Connelly was also a very good actress, but she has since retired from acting after appearing in only two films. This movie brought back a lot of memories about the 70's and the 80's and how innocent love could be in times that weren't so troubled.I highly recommend this film, not just for sports enthusiasts, but for also those who are seeking a romantic love story.My rating - 8 out of 10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjAwYTJlMTktNTUxYy00YzA0LTkyZmEtZjJlMWYyNTYxYjdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Hushpuppy doesn't have a drunk father, she has a Father, with many of the faults and strengths of the immortal epic heroes -- anger, pride, genuine love and concern. Hushpuppy herself isn't just a little girl, she is The Child -- the purveyor of a magic which is real, intimately connected with her world, imaginatively linked with All Things. The outside world is a place of Things and Machines, of paperwork and rules -- and is never actually named, you see, because that would diminish it.

This cinematic gem not only breathes new life into Orwell's seminal work but also pays homage to Evgeny Zamyatin's ""We,"" a novel that undoubtedly influenced Orwell's dystopian vision.""1984"" transcends the boundaries of a mere adaptation; impeccable visual imagery, stellar performances, and a haunting musical score. The result is a gripping drama interwoven with elements of black comedy, a refreshing take on Orwell's somewhat dated narrative.The film catapults us into a future United State dominated by the omnipotent Big Brother, where technological progress coexists with societal alienation, dilapidated streets, and synthetic sustenance. Here, imagination is suppressed, deemed a societal ailment. Diana Ringo deftly navigate this dystopian landscape, infusing it with a fresh and contemporary relevance.At the heart of the narrative is the brilliant portrayal of the main character, D-503, by Aleksandr Obmanov. His nuanced performance captures the essence of a man torn between conformity and the yearning for individuality, adding layers of complexity to the character. Opposite him, Sergey Khrustalev delivers a compelling performance as the investigator, unraveling the mysteries of this dystopian society with a captivating intensity.Cinematographically, ""1984"" is a visual feast. Diana Ringo employs a unique and artistic approach, creating a visual language that perfectly complements the narrative. The juxtaposition of sleek technological advancements against the backdrop of grimy streets and the prohibition of fantasy paints a vivid picture of a society teetering on the edge of its own demise.The film's exploration of themes such as surveillance, conformity, and the suppression of individuality resonates strongly in today's world, making ""1984"" not just a nostalgic homage to the past but a poignant reflection of our present and potential future.While the 1984 adaptation from nearly six decades ago painted a bleak portrait of a society reminiscent of a communist-like totalitarian state, Diana Ringo's ""1984"" introduces a fresh perspective. It embraces the technological strides of our time while preserving the essence of Orwell's cautionary tale against the erosion of human autonomy.""1984"" directed by Diana Ringo is a cinematic triumph, a thought-provoking and visually stunning masterpiece that breathes new life into a classic while paying homage to the literary influences that shaped it. This film is a must-watch for those seeking a captivating exploration of dystopia, societal control, and the enduring power of human spirit in the face of oppression.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDYyNzNmODctMzA5NS00ZGNiLWJjM2MtMzVmNzk2MGVhNmYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUyNzM5MDA@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I've seen plenty of 1 and 2 star movies, but, this was not one of them.What I want to know from a review is whether or not a movie is worth watching. I do like action films and I don't dislike Sean Penn. This review comes from that angle.You're not going to find cars jumping between sky scrapers, people falling 100s of feet and walking away or phony cliffhangers in this film. What you will find is an attempt to show necessary action in a mostly realistic way.Sean Penn's role is more like Rambo than Superman. The action was original, clever and well executed. The dialogue was realistic and the acting was believable.The only reason I didn't give it an 8 or 9 is because I felt it tried to do too much in too little time. That having been said making the movie longer wouldn't have worked because it would have taken 5 hours to do it right. The first 20 minutes could have been its own 2 hour film.That having been said it all made sense. I didn't leave the theater wondering why or how anything happened.

Also, no spoilers.At first I was very surprised by the visuals - the movie started and it looked genuinely good...at first, before you realize that the filmmakers had only 2, maybe 3 small sets and that the film is visually very repetitive (even some of the same shots are used multiple times). That in itself isn't such a huge issue, seeing how there are plenty of films that take place in a single location but they compensate for their visual simplicity with an interesting story and engaging performances, something that's very much lacking here. As for the visual effects, they are ok by early 2000s standards.The music was good and well implemented. The standout piece for me is Arvo Part's ""My Heart's in the Highlands"" which was also used in ""The Great Beauty"" (a good film worth checking out if you're not into conventional films or if you're a fan of Fellini).The performances are not great. Sebastian Cavazza's performance as the astronaut Milutin is either bad or at best mediocre (I don't know if I can blame him, the director or the poor script for that). Milutin has no real depth and I struggle to describe his personality beyond saying that he's an astronaut with a gruff voice who swears a lot and is horny (oh, and a bit sad, I guess). At one point in the movie we are told that he's severely depressed and if it weren't for that line I would have never guessed that that's where he's at emotionally, you just can't feel it. The few times Cavazza tries to convey emotions that aren't anger and frustration his performance is borderline laughable. Stoya, who plays the part of Nimani, did her job...ok. She plays the part of an emotionless android with a few preprogrammed emotional settings well enough, nothing noteworthy though.The story is very derivative. If you've seen a film that deals with AI than there's nothing here that you haven't seen before and done way better. The plot is bare bones and shallow with plenty of meandering (albeit aesthetically pleasing) shots of the same 2 (or 3) sets of the ship or of Nimani standing/sleeping/levitating around the ship - shots that don't progress the plot in any way or give any information to the viewer - they're just there to stretch the runtime of the movie. The questions this film raises are raised in other, better movies/TV shows (most notably ""Her"", ""Ex Machina"", both ""Blade Runner"" movies and ""Westworld"") and done so with more nuance. If you're someone who just wants to watch a movie to pass the time you'll probably find this movie boring and bland, on the other hand if you're someone who wants to experience a deep and meaningful film you'll find it lacking as well.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I1M2Q2MWUtM2M3MS00MGVhLTkyNjktMmY5NGE4ZmM1ODE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzI1NzMxNzM@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Although it's not actually based on a book, John Cromwell's tautly-directed film noir owes more than a little of its plotting and characterization to earlier classic crime novels-turned-classic Bogart movies. Indeed, when my husband Vin entered the room while the film was on, he began watching it with me and soon asked, ""Is this THE BIG SLEEP, or THE MALTESE FALCON?"" However, DEAD RECKONING is steeped in the kind of bitter post-war viciousness that distinguished Mickey Spillane's writing -- not that there's anything wrong with that! :-) Bogart commands the screen as Rip Murdock, a former Army paratrooper (lots of colorful references to parachutes and jumping here) and one of the most misogynistic good guys he ever played (not that you can blame Rip, after the wringer he's put through in this film). Captain Rip starts out trying to find out why his Sergeant and pal Johnny Drake (William Prince) has a Yale pin with the name ""John Joseph Preston"" on it, and more importantly, why Johnny bolts rather than accept the Congressional Medal of Honor for his wartime heroism. Rip's investigation leads him to Gulf City, Tropical Paradise of the South (don't take my word for it, check out the neon sign in the upper right-hand corner of the screen in the opening establishing shot :-), where he's quickly sucked into a whirlpool of secrets, double-crossing, murder, and such inventive mayhem as tossing napalm-powered Molotov cocktails at sinister smoothie Morris Carnovsky and his psycho henchman Marvin (THE MILLIONAIRE) Miller to make them talk. Standing in for quintessential Bogart leading lady Lauren Bacall (and original leading lady Rita Hayworth, who was hung up making THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI) is Lizabeth Scott as mysterious chanteuse Coral Chandler, the kind of dame guys go gaga for against their better judgment (she's got so many pet names from her various beaus that the first time I saw the film, I wasn't quite sure if her name was ""Coral,"" ""Dusty,"" or, of all things, ""Mike""!). While Scott's no Bacall (don't get me wrong, Scott fans, I like her, but to my ears, her husky voice always sounds more phlegmy than sultry. Every time Scott speaks, I half-expect someone to offer her a cough drop!), she's certainly chock full of luminous blonde beauty, plus Scott has an air of wounded vulnerability that makes me empathize with her in spite of myself. Sometimes the film is gloriously, deliriously nutzoid. For instance, Bogart's speech to Scott early on about how men should be able to reduce women to pocket-size when necessary, and Scott's interpretation of this theory, must be heard to be believed. But when DEAD RECKONING works, it's dynamite (literally, when Bogart and Scott join forces with safecracker/explosives expert Wallace Ford)! Even when things get ugly, this movie is always gorgeous to look at, thanks to the stunning use of shadows and light in Leo Tover's black-and-white photography. If you love Bogart and you like your film noir grim yet glamorous and over-the-top at times, DEAD RECKONING is well worth a look.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzc5ZGQxMDUtNDY1NS00ZmQzLWIyYzYtZGJmNzA3MjJjNzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzU4ODM5Nw@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Hunsecker coerces unscrupulous press agent Sidney Falco into breaking up his sister's romance with a jazz musician.","159","3 Good Reasons To Watch This Film","There are three reasons that movie fans should check this film out, if you haven't seen it yet:1 - Outstanding dialog. I can't recall a film in which I heard so many clever film-noir lines as this one. Almost everyone in the movie has a unique way of expressing their feelings. It makes the movie one that you want to go back and HEAR again. Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman wrote the screenplay and deserve special recognition as well as the people below.2 - Fabulous acting, led by the two male leads: Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster. Curtis is the star of the film with many more lines than anyone else, and many consider this to be his greatest acting achievement. I have no quarrel with that. It's one of the finest acting jobs I've ever witnessed by anyone. It's that good. Lancaster is memorable and plays to his strengths as a tough guy, not only with his physical presence but his tactless and cutting verbal assaults. He has the best and most brutal lines in the film.The minor characters in here, from the cop to the comedian to the cigarette girl to the young romantic couple are all top-notch.3 - The cinematography. A big name in the film business, James Wong Howe, more than lives up to his reputation. This is beautifully photographed and looks absolutely stunning on DVD. I have watched hundreds and hundreds of black-and-white films and this ranks with the best of them. He captured nighttime New York City as well as anybody ever has done.""Well,"" you might ask, ""if this movie is so great, why haven't I heard more about it?""Maybe because it never did well at the box office. It wasn't promoted a lot, from what I heard, and the storyline is not a pleasant one. Basically, this is about two immoral people who smear a nice guy so that it will ruin the romance between he and Lancaster's sister. Lancaster plays an absolutely ruthless newspaper columnist who makes and breaks careers and Curtis plays his slimy press-agent who will do anything to please his powerful boss, including doing the worst of his dirty work.Furrther details of the film can be read by many of the other fine reviewers here on this website, so no need to go into that.I am not one who generally likes films that feature mostly nasty people but this was done so well that it fascinates me every time. A final tip of the hat to director Alexander Mackendrick. Why he wasn't given more films to direct is a mystery to me. Highly-recommended.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmJiNWFjN2ItOGY1ZS00MDI4LWJjYjYtMjlmYWYwNGNmODMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTYwMTcxOTYy._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It has so many details, so many reactions of the characters so the pleasures game that the director wants to play that is difficult for me to treat the film only in only direction or conclusion. As you may have read before, it tells us about a film director in his forties that is shooting an erotic scene and he discovers how the actress enjoys breaking the taboo of masturbation in front of a camera. She tells him how intense and marvelous that feeling was, but after a time they meet by random and she tells him he traumatized her... now the director is interested about what crosses to someone's mind when breaking a rule himself has imposed. I will not say this is a psychologist study, nor a pornographic film although the extremely explicit content, but it is such and intense and dark look about how we can become blind by our passions instead of use our head and the advices we receive from our friends (wife and grandmother in the film). And we all know how naturally and honestly french talk about feelings, which make the film believable. For me, it was a whole experience and, with the Danish film Princess, and maybe the Swish Snow White and Brannagh's The Magic Flute, the only worthy film of the Sevilla 06 film festival.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdjYzUyOTAtZDMzMC00MmU4LWIwM2ItNmI1YzliMDMyNjI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzY0MTE3NzU@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Genius lies in simplicity, because on one hand, you can say, that you've seen so many films with partly similar scenario, but on the other this one looks totally different. It has something that keeps you interested. For example the old good school look. I mean, every time when I hear that the movie is based on school life it seems to be kind of lame. Not with this piece of art. First of all, script is good. Very good. As I said, it is simple, but on the same time very catchy. The movie is slow, but everything that happens means something, so it isn't boring at all. Secondly, both leading roles are perfectly acted.

How a reviewer can focus on Brando's piece of business with walnuts is beyond me -- his business with the espresso is even more effective.  But why zoom in on one relatively insignificant piece of Brando schtick when you have his whole performance to salivate over, and the equally outstanding performances of the entire cast.  There is not one false note or faltering moment in this fabulously clever and eminently watchable film.  Yes, Bert Parks does stand out in his cameo performance, as does B.D.

Yes, the notorious Jean-Claude Brisseau, director of 'The Exterminating Angels' and 'Secret Things,' is back with his latest provocation. Another idiosyncratic philosophical meditation on the enigmas of female sexuality, it features the director's latest discovery, Carole Brana. Pretentious smut for high-brows, a dirty old man's fantasies writ large, or a profound and daring exploration of society's sexual taboos? You decide."" It's easy enough to decide that this is not ""pretentious smut for highbrows"" (do highbrows like smut?) or a ""dirty old man's fantasies writ large."" It is far too beautiful and intelligent and thoughtful for that. It's an odd film, which combines S/M, religious ecstasy, and some basic information about cosmology in an attractive package. Perhaps only a French filmmaker could have made this. And only a man still conventional in his notions of sexual roles could put lovely nude women on display having sex with each other and masturbating with men in charge and think it a bold exploration of new possibilities.'ÃÂ l'aventure' begins like a New Wave film, with conversation and random meetings. It might be early Eric Rohmer, for a little while, anyway; not for long. Sandrine (Carole Brana) sits on a bench talking to her friend Sophie (Lise Bellynck), and an older man (ÃÂtienne Chicot) joins them and makes wise reflections. What he says later influences her. She is about to come into an inheritance. She offends her boyfriend Fred (Jocelyn Quivrin) by masturbating in the next room after they have had sex. He says she's become a ""slut"" and very soon afterward he moves out.Sandrine strikes up a conversation at a cafÃÂ© with Greg (Arnaud Binard), a good looking man with books on psychology and hypnosis. It turns out he is training to be a psychiatrist. And he experiments on his patients. Sandrine immediately finds him attractive and says so. They go straight to his bedroom.Later, Greg introduces Sandrine to several women and she also meets a long-haired architect and decorator, JÃÂ©rome (FrÃÂ©dÃÂ©ric Aspisi), who's into heightening women's orgasms by playing their S/M master. Eventually Greg takes some of the women on a risky trip to ecstatic experience. All the while Sandrine keeps meeting the older man on the bench, and eventually at his cabin out in the country. He is a taxi driver but also studied meditation in India and taught physics. He outlines the rough history of the cosmos to Sandrine and gives a simplified explanation of Relativity.The women are beautiful, especially the radiant Carole Brana. As the ""Old Man,"" ÃÂtienne Chicot speaks with resonant authority and a healthy touch of humor. It is true that Brisseau's scenes of women having sex go further than usual; when men are shown, it's quite conventional. Greg and Jerome just watch. Poor Fred's performance is deemed unsatisfying. Even the shots of landscape around the Old Man's cabin are lovely. Watching the film is soothing and aesthetically pleasurable. At the end, the Old Man proclaims Greg's experiments foolish and risky; but other than a paranormal internal storm after a woman's reliving of a saint's spiritual enlightenment, there are no consequences.The problem with this pleasant and in some ways daring film is that it is far too often more expository than dramatic. No matter how good looking the people and the settings are, it's hard to shake off the impression that one is being lectured -- and not on a very sophisticated level. Nothing is imparted that one would not get in elementary courses or basic reading in psychology, cosmology, religious experience, and physics. The wisest advice comes from Sandrine's mother (Michele Larue). She counsels her to go back to Fred and tells her she's lucky that instead of having boredom with a young lover ahead, she will discover love for a man she doesn't like enough yet. Convention, she says, is necessary. But as the film ends, Sandrine hasn't discovered that yet. The film barely touches on the possible negative consequences of a life that's more exploratory than practical. Brisseau is 65. Is this where French baby boomers are at? 'ÃÂ l'aventure' has been optioned by IFC. It opens in France April 1, 2009. It was shown in February 2009 as part of the 'Film Comment' Selects series at Lincoln Center, New York.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk1NjcyMjc4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDcyMjcwMzE@._V1_UY209_CR8,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

And this unlocks why part 3 still works: gone is the chipper camp counselor and her hopes of making good clean friends. Now, returning incognito as a camper, she realizes the world is a terrible terrible place filled with terrible terrible people. Round 3 of the chaos, and she picks up her axe with the same sigh and groan you might hear from a daughter assigned to ""wash the dishes, make your bed, clean the toilets, and take out the trash."" Why can't she find people who deserve to live for once? That's not to say Sleepaway Camp 3 has lost its sense of humor. Far from it. It delights in exploiting a silly trust building exercise: Angela gets to tie up and lead her blindfolded partner through the woods. ""You do drugs?"" Angela quizzes her buddy. To which the girl replies, ""Doesn't everyone?"" Like the good girl-scout she is, Angie leads this poor misguided soul to miraculous deliverance, and I say miraculous because of how far fetched the murder is (but it's still a treat to watch.) Angela, herself, still has her sly wisecracks and all-too-honest answers to questions (questions like ""where'd you learn to chop wood like that?""), only the delivery has changed from cheerful optimism to ""why me?"" (although she does sing the Happy Camper song over one of the murders.) And this time she gets to play with more colorful, over the top, (read: annoying) fodder! We have a perverted old man, lazy hypocrite, a rapper, a rich snob, a dufus, aÃÂwhy I am even bothering? Never mind, them. Angie'll get to them sooner or later (hurry up on the rapper ÃÂ please, God, hurry up.) The group of campers split up into 3 smaller groups, and our heroine dispatches each sub-group one at a time and then shows up to the next group like a lost puppy, ""I was told to switch with someone from this group"" and the fun starts again.Unlike most slashers, the kills largely take place in broad daylight giving the whole scenario a matter-of-fact quality that I liked. This *is* Angela's day job, after all. She's not Jason or Freddy ÃÂ the girl has to sleep sometime. Besides, I like the idea of her moonlighting as a jazz musician or a dance instructor or a cop with Stendhal Syndrome or something.Once again the series misses a number of opportunities to really rip into the genre's shortcomings (like poking fun at the gore obsession.) But the film's unwillingness to do anything significant with Barney (father of Sean in the previous film) bothered me the most. Here was a chance to actually build up a sympathetic character ÃÂ someone we'd actually root for to stop Angela. Or perhaps even build him up as a character we really despise who could actually threaten Angela (early in the film he's asked what he would do if he came across Angela Baker. Without hesitation he answers, ""I'd kill her."") War of the killers? Who do we root for ÃÂ the wickedly fun Angela, or a revenge-driven father? This would take Sleepaway Camp into entirely new territory, allowing it to stand apart from the existing entries. But, nope, Barney exists as another victim for Angela, and after a brief unsatisfactory confrontation it's a moot point.Like it's predecessor, SC3: Teenage Wasteland never hits the grand slam it should. But, what the hell, I love it anyway.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA4MWQzMWUtZGExMS00ZmJhLWFmOGQtNDc3YWIzNzMxNjJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

"The Jane Austen Book Club","1998.0","A","106.0","Comedy, Drama, Romance","6.7","61.0","Robin Swicord","Kathy Baker, Hugh Dancy, Amy Brenneman, Maria Bello","29,100","Six Californians start a club to discuss the works of Jane Austen, only to find their relationships -- both old and new -- begin to resemble 21st century versions of her novels.","68","One half the world does not understand the pleasures of the other....","Let's get one thing out of the way, first. This IS largely a chick-flick, although many men who go to see it are likely to get caught up in at least one of the subplots. The litmus test is Love, Actually--if you enjoyed that movie, and are a man, I imagine you'll like this one as well. There are several attractive females, some lesbian domestic affection scenes handled with remarkable matter-of-factness, and the film (and novel) handles the male characters gently and with love.But it is a movie that with primary appeal to two groups--chicks and Jane Austen devotees, including the male ones. Are there enough of these to make a movie a success? Yes, there are.Jane Austen's work stays current because she wrote about timeless themes--how do you choose the best person to marry? Is love enough, or even required for lifelong contentment? How do you deal with difficult or embarrassing family members? How best to handle a family crisis? How do you learn to tell true friends and quality persons from those who are perhaps flashy and amusing, but will end up betraying your friendship and trust or, heaven forfend, tempting you to abandon your own principles? Whether you live in the age of Blackberries and Hybrid SUV's, or the age of sealing wax and barouches, every person comes smack up against many or most of these vexing problems throughout their lives.The conceit of this movie and the book it is based upon is that a shared love and appreciation of the works of Jane Austen can provide the currency through the exchange of which modern women (and a few selected men) can confront, share, and come to better understand their personal challenges and in the process, form bonds of friendship or even romance. The strength of this movie is that even if you have a tough time with that conceit, you will still enjoy the humor of it, and the strong performances. It's pleasant to watch, like curling up with a favorite book and a frothy cup of chocolate. It is true to JaneÃÂno explosions, the villains aren't completely evil, the primary problems of the characters stem from incomplete or willfully-faulty understanding of themselves and those around them, there is no melodrama or Gothic touches except of the parody sort, and the lone death happens off screen.I have this weird little theory about why P&P is the MOST beloved of all of Austen's books. Sure, Darcy is a smoldering hunk of tightly-controlled passion and Lizzie is as spirited and intelligent a heroine as ever nanced through a foot of mud to get to the bedside of an ailing sister, but that's not it.In all the other Austen pairings, you had a sense that they were pairings which would truly happen in real life because deep down we know nothing has really changed from Austen's day--women's beauty and youth and social standing is factored into a certain equation which determines how handsome, wealthy, charming, accomplished, or respected a man she is able to aspire to. In no case, other than P&P, does this basic equation get violated. Lady Catherine De Bourg had it right. A shocking match, indeed! The Lizzie/Darcy romance, therefore, is the lone Cinderella story, and don't give me Edmund and Fanny, as Edmund was a younger son most in need of a virtuous wife who wouldn't ever embarrass him and was never laid out as a man of wildly attractive appearance while virtuous Fanny's looks were improved enough to attract the flirtatious Henry Crawford.So, we women, all of us, are madly in love with P&P precisely because it is the ultimate fantasy of this amazing guy who will love us JUST FOR OUR QUICK WIT, GOOD HEART, and FINE EYES. There are no Mr. Darcy's, just like there are no characters of the sort commonly played by John Cusack, so get over it, already. There is possibly a Mr. Rochester, but remember, he had a crazy wife locked in the attic, a creepy housekeeper, an insipid ward, a bit of a sarcastic streak, and was once played on screen by a pudgy Orson Wells. In other words, a lot of baggage. And he still wasn't able to be brought up to scratch by Plain Jane Eyre until his fine big house had been burned down, his eyes put out, and his arm messed up. Now THAT is reality.It is true in real life that single dog breeders can, and do, meet nice men and fall in love and maybe even get married. It is also true that nice, handsome, heterosexual men join book clubs*.But this movie serves up impossibly cute Hugh Dancy in the role of an implausibly unattached, adorably geeky Grigg Harris who loves reading, older women, and can dance gracefully despite being too clumsy to artfully sip a cocktail. The statistical probability of such an attractive and unspoiled man (one who admits he is willing to be ""directed"") like this joining your book club and then actually wanting to develop a romantic relationship with an unattached woman older than himself is approximately the same as seeing one of the Dragonriders of Pern barnstorming over an Iowa cornfield.In the RL JABC, Grigg would be gay and Allegra would be straight and Bernadette would be queuing up for the Early Bird Special at Cracker Barrel. And your cheating ex-spouse, Jimmy Smits, ain't never coming back, and if he did, it would be after a series of weepy drunken whiny pathetic phone calls at 3am. There will be no ""letter"". This movie is a little bit cruel to imply otherwise.But that's OK. The world would be a very unkind place without at least the notion of dragons and rocketships, Darcys and Griggs. And that is why we loved it.*with wife.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5MTYwMzM3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTAxODM1MQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's almost like anomalous nature of the story, in and of itself, is enough to evidence the film's legitimacy to these people. In reality, and to people who know how to think critically, it should be a red flag. Conversely, and similarly confusing to me, is the fact that these same people seem to think that the fact that they have been told the same story from other sources (or as they call them, the ""winners"") on more than one occasion somehow discredits those versions, simply by virtue of the fact that they are corroborated ad nauseum. In reality, that fact should only support the legitimacy of those versions. Such, I suppose, is the fruit of the conspiracy theorist's tree. Clearly, there is confirmation bias here; these people WANT this to be true, so they legitimize this ridiculous film by claiming that everyone has been lied to and THIS FILM is the truth. I would just say one thing: says who? It's completely unsourced, and is just a bunch of videos parsed together with some guy talking, OR typed words scrolling up the screen. The bottom line is that this film flies in the face of (probably) the most well documented, and highly evidenced period on all of human history. The are no words to properly describe the holocaust; it is, and I feel will remain to be, the worst event in modern history. The complete depravity with which Jews were treated during this time was a contributing factor to the copious amounts of evidence supporting it. The people responsible for this filth of a film want you to believe that the fact that this time period is highly corroborated is somehow evidence of the LACK of legitimacy of normative history. I have to ask, on what Earth are you living where this logic holds? That logic, however, is the last weapon of the conspiracy theorist; they have to come up with SOMETHING to justify their ridiculous position that flies in the face of documents, films, pictures, and numerous historians, all with completely consistent views. The only way to do that is the way in which they do: the fact that there is so much corroboration and consistency (says they) is the exact reason why we cannot trust it!I'm not saying that the idea of a historical conspiracy is impossible; but in this instance, where this group has not one shred of evidence other than their self-serving and unsupported statements, their position should not, and cannot, be taken seriously. We are left back at the beginning; this film is nothing more than a propaganda film that seeks to thrust upon us the ridiculous image of Hitler frolicking in the wilderness as a peaceful and loving man, who had no knowledge of the death camps (once again, despite numerous documentary evidence from infinite sources from all walks of life to the contrary).It's funny - you can go watch this film on Youtube, where if you make a negative or critical comment of the film in the comments section, the poster will swiftly remove your comment, calling you a ""jewbot."" This is the type of person who idolizes this film, and such absurd intolerance of other view points is the exact climate in which Nazi Germany arose in the first place. I suppose the irony is lost on the feeble-minded makers of this film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4Mzk4Njc3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTgxODc3MTE@._V1_UY209_CR6,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This is also a film about facades, lying and truth telling.From the opening montage of `Gay or Not Gay' in a supermarket this is a film with many laughs and people that you want to care about.A true ensemble cast, ostensibly headed by Timothy Olyphant as Dennis, is only part of what makes this a fine piece of cinematic work.Dean Cain (Cole) as the pretty-boy actor at one point says about his obvious good looks: ÃÂIt's my way in ... and then I have to prove if I have the #@%* to back it up.'  Mr. Cain proves that he does have the ability to back it up.  Matt McGrath (Howie) as a man searching for love and doesn't realize he has it within his grasp, has a Mathew Broderick look that is very engaging.The always-interesting John Mahoney is outstanding as the coach of the `Broken Hearts Club' baseball team that wears the uniform of his restaurant and bar where the perennially losing team goes after their pathetic attempts at playing baseball.Colour becomes a character as embodied by Robert Arce as `Purple Guy.'  He speaks only once in the film -- but it is worth listening to.There are many outstanding actors -- many currently in television series -- John Mahoney (Fraser), Zach Braff (Scrubs), Chris Payne and Ben Weber who have both done time on `Sex in the City.' But it was particularly nice to see Jennifer Coolidge who will always be Stiffler's Mom in the `American Pie' films. Andrew Keegan as Kevin the `newbie' is exceptional -- learning about himself and life in West Hollywood whether he wants to or not.This is very much writer/director Greg Berlanti's film -- these must be people he knows and so writes about.  At one point one of the characters says 'they should make a movie about us.'  Well, Mr. Berlanti did and it is quite an accomplishment because even though the characters are gay the lives they lead, the questions they ask, the problems they face and the joys they experience are universal.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmZlODkzNmItZmIwZi00OGYxLTkwMjQtMzlhYmYwNjMwNzlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

One such high-spirited thoroughbred is Australian naturalist Robyn Davidson who, at the age of 27, crossed the Australian outback in 1977 from Alice Springs to the Indian Ocean with only four camels and her dog as companions. Nominated for Best Film at the Venice Film Festival, Director John Curran's Tracks documented Davidson's nine-month journey of 1677 miles without adding layers of melodrama to distract us from her true spirit of adventure and love of nature.Based on Robyn Davidson's classic travel book of the same name and supported by the extraordinary cinematography of Mandy Walker and the lovely score by Garth Stevenson, the film follows Robyn as she travels solo across the unfathomable desert. Sponsored by National Geographic magazine, photographer Rick Smolan (Adam Driver) was chosen by the magazine to photograph her journey for the magazine, but only meets up with her at scattered points during her trip. Davidson at first finds Rick annoyingly over-talkative, but slowly warms to his support and caring and they become friends, while still keeping their distance.Not much information is given as to Robyn's motivations in undertaking this adventure, but the film does provide flashbacks over the course of the film informing us about events in the naturalist's past involving loss and disappointment. In some ways, comparable to Chris McCandless' odyssey as documented in Sean Penn's 2007 film Into the Wild, Robyn's goal is to convince herself that she is up to the task of following her own path without having to conform to society's expectations. In spite of her need for solitude, however, she learns to compromise with friends and reach an understanding with visiting journalists looking for a story, even though at one point she says to a resident of the desert, ""It's hard to explain that I just want perfectly nice people to shut up and die."" Though Robyn does her best to avoid the unwanted company, she eventually recognizes her need for support from others, not only from Rick, but also from an Aboriginal elder named Eddy (Roly Mintuma), who accompanies her to make sure that she avoids the Aboriginal's sacred land. Mia Wasikowska as Davidson perfectly captures the sharp edges of her enigmatic personality while still retaining her adamant refusal to be the effect of her social limitations. It is a strong performance that may earn her consideration for a Best Actress award at the 2014 Oscars.Though some viewers may become restless with the unchanging landscape and the lack of overt drama, obstacles do appear in the form of wild bull camels charging towards her and the need for her to take a 160 mile detour to avoid Aboriginal lands. While Tracks has a surprising amount of clutter for an adventure into the wild, as Davidson comes closer to her goal, the growing quiet and emptiness of the vast outback turns her journey into an experience that assumes a dreamlike and spiritual aura.Through it all, her fierce determination to accomplish her goal while still retaining her sense of self grows stronger. Davidson in a recent interview said that ""At the time, all young people pretty much wanted to do extraordinary things and extend the limits of what had been given to them as their roles."" Poet e e cummings agrees, saying, ""To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battles which any human being can fight, and never stop fighting."" That is the legacy of Robyn Davidson.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkyMjIzOTQ4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTkzMDM1MTE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He wants to be loved; she needs a meaningful relationship. However--could he be her missing father?","2","Nastassja Kinski 1978: star power of the first order of magnitude","""Stay as You Are"" was Nastassja Kinski's fifth film following the 1975 Wim Wenders, ""The Wrong Move,"" a so-so 1976 ""To the Devil...a Daughter,"" and the two forgettable's: 1977 ""Only For Your Love"" and the 1978 ""Boarding School."" It is an Italian film of the time with its own mores with respect to extra marital affairs - a repeated undercurrent in many Italian films. ""Stay as You Are"" follows an older man who is contemplating an affair with a young girl, Nastassja Kinski, who is the same age as his own daughter but with the complication that Nastassja may actually be his real daughter from an affair of twenty years ago. A good European director can finesse this sort of situation. Most American directors would be over their heads and would be fortunate if they could tread water because the subject would be taboo in the American market. The actor is the legendary Marcello Mastroianni who at the time would have been 54. In viewing her early films, it is hard to not conclude that Nastassja has a birth year of 1959 and not the claimed 1961 because of her physical development. Perhaps she was just precocious. That would have placed her at nineteen for this film. The next year would give us Roman Polanski's ""Tess"" and ""Stay as You Are"" was a good prelude because it showed that, even at her young age, Nastassja had the screen presence to carry movies on her own opposite one of the European super stars of the time. The VHS tape that I saw was dubbed into English with neither voices matching either Nastassja's or Mastroianni's actual voices. For me, it is better to watch a movie in its native language with English subtitles, unless the principal actors do their own dubbing. An awful example of English dubbing is the French movie ""La Femme Nikita."" The voice is an integral part of an actor's screen presence, unless playing a mute like Nastassja did in ""The Wrong Move."" Some actors always sound the same, movie after movie. Nastassja Kinski is able to change her voice, according to the the needs of her role. She is one of very few actresses who is fluent in multiple languages. In ""To the Devil...a Daughter"" it is English, ""The Blonde"" it is Italian, ""Moon in the Gutter"" it is French, ""Terminal Velocity"" there is a little Russian. The bulk of her movies are in English. ""Faraway, So Close"" there is both German and English. ""Paris, Texas"" has Nastassja in a convincing Texan accent in which one would be hard pressed to know from the voice that it is she.Marcello Mastroianni always seems to bring a signature vulnerability whose intensity varies with the role. These characters are usually thoughtful and contemplative with an edge of awkwardness. Another way of putting it, is that these roles usually have depth. In ""Stay as You Are"" Mastroianni is almost entirely reactive to Nastassja's character. At first, he pursues her, then she pursues him because she likes older man. Then it is back and forth. Nastassja has to carry the movie. Sometimes she is flighty and silly. Other times she is serious. Her physical beauty is easily matched by her acting talent. Her movements are fluid, sometimes discontinuous, and her face ever changing as appropriate to the situation. Nastassja Kinski is a great natural actress who makes everything look easy. Her performances are always intelligent with a screen savviness that can be mesmerizing.""Stay as You Are"" is a tender romantic jewel that is difficult to find on VHS tape and expensive, if found. Along with ""The Wrong Move,"" it would benefit from a first class transfer onto DVD with commentaries from Wim Wenders and Nastassja Kinski. I would have to include both ""The Wrong Move"" and ""Stay as You Are"" in any list of her core set of movies. There is a region 2 DVD widescreen version that is playable on a computer DVD, but it is in Italian with no English subtitles. With its not unexpected symmetry, ""Stay as You Are"" and Nastassja Kinski is cinema magic.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUyZDVhYjMtOWRkOC00MTc5LTk3ZWUtZGExZjc2NTE4YjdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDE5MTU2MDE@._V1_UY209_CR9,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

We less fortunate - we dig it and we dig it deep and completely. True beauty of this flick is in the ""wholesomeness"" of the Big Picture - and it seems too heavy for most American viewers to understand it. Yeah, there is age difference, but thats completely out of the point. I myself was in the similar position not that long time ago and we weren't the friends :D Thats why I could see some of the masters work by Bell - her face when Little Jason is starting his story. It goes from focusing attention to smile, but that is one really specific smile - it comes from the heart. Let me tell you - Kristen Bell is pure magic. She already had me in Veronica Mars, but this is much better. Shes magnificent artist and now I understand why she done this movie. It fits her really well.Also, writing is really original - no big ""turnover"", no ""comeback"", not a f***n happy ending - it ends but end is not really an end. You're left with a though of love between Leigh and Jayson, but with a kind of hope.Like I said, most Americans defines their relationship as ""statuary rape"" and have a panic attack when movie didn't teach us that their this were wrong. Well, this is obviously a hard thing to swallow. Judgment is left to us, the viewers. If you need a frikin confirmation of yours beliefs, what kind of beliefs are those? ofc its immoral, questionable, unfair to the younger partner, but that was a love on a first sight.I was really depressed in the end, especially cause I expected from the poster for this movie to be some kind of mindless fun with Veronica Mars. Hot blonde, bathing suite, underage teenagers.. Lets rock'n'roll! Lets push the boundaries really far, far away.. And this movie did it - it awakens true feelings and some painful memories and its REAL. Unlike most hollywoodesque garbage nowdays with utter boring scripts, this one feels like real life. Its ART.

In order to do this, he refrains from making cheap stupid international movies like ""Resident Evil"" and dumb German comedies and makes a big movie that he calls important. After ""Der Untergang"" and ""Das Parfum"" we now get ""Der Baader-Meinhof Komplex"".One really wonders who this movie was made for. People who don't know anything about the RAF will not understand most of what is going on. People who know some stuff about this will only find the things that they already know and experts on the topic will be horrified about the simplifications and elisions.The movie looks great, as it should be expected. It really looks like it is from the era. All technical aspects are wonderful, the cinematography, the action, sound, effects. And the actors do an incredible job. Martina Gedeck and Johanna Wokalek stand out in this universally good cast as Ulrike Meinhof and Gudrun Ensslin.Also, to be fair, it has to be said, that the beginning of the movie is really gripping and well done. The viewer gets to understand a lot about the feeling of the time and the intentions of the protagonists are well-explained.But the whole thing goes downhill after a while. By the time Ulrike Meinhof joins the group and Andreas Baader breaks out of prison, we lose focus. Suddenly there are new members in almost every scene and none of them gets introduced properly (with the exception of Peter-JÃÂ¼rgen Boock). Certainly, not every character needs a back story, but it would have been essential to tell the audience at least how these recruits got to join the group in general.By the time that Meinhof, Baader and Ensslin are imprisoned, we really don't care about the RAF any more. And this is mainly because we have no idea who these ""2nd generation"" people are. Even people who know about the RAF will wonder who this or that guy in each scene is supposed to be because only few of them are even mentioned by name. The assassinations of von Mirbach, Buback and Ponto are just checked off a list to get the story to completion. And the whole Schleyer-kidnapping as well as the attack on the ""Landshut"" which are supposed to serve as the climax of the movie have terrible timing and leave out so much important information.But also the handling of characters of the ""1st generation"" is done poorly in parts. Raspe is basically absent from the movie until he gets taken in by the police, same with Meins, whose only purpose in the movie it is to get captured, force-fed and then die. Only these three scenes. Nothing more is seen of him! Neither Eichinger nor Edel really cared to explain or teach anything. The whole thing was just planned as a big production to show off 2/3 of the more well-known actors working in Germany in one movie. Even the guy who attempts to assassinate Rudi Dutschke gets played by a well known actor (Tom Schilling). What this movie would have needed is the kind of epilogue that Eichinger put at the end of ""der Untergang"" to show what happened to some characters and also to even explain who these characters were supposed to be.So, we only have one more chance to find out. Since the movie is filled with well-known actors, reading the credits might help. No chance here. Except for the main characters no character name is mentioned in the credits, only the actors who showed up. To me, this is the ultimate proof that Eichinger didn't care about the characters at all, all he cared about was the actors he could squish into this movie.There are other things that others will criticize, for example the way the victims are turned just into cardboard figures with no purpose other than getting assassinated, or the fact that the German government, which was very involved especially in the final act, is not present at all. I personally do not mind these things too much, because I understand that this is not the story the makers wanted to tell.I only criticize the movie for what it is. A nice-looking, but unfortunately very hollow and confusing piece of work. Too bad. It was a great chance that was missed here.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWViYjU3MGYtMTExYy00OTgzLThiZWItZTgwNDI0NDM3OWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDAyMjM2OQ@@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Shamoto tries to go against the grain, to say 'I don't want things to be like this.' But he finds himself alone against everything and has to learn some unpleasant truths about the world.This is a very bleak movie and over-the-top in its negativity. It can be hard to watch at times but the violence is not gratuitous. It serves a purpose. The (brilliant) ending would not have the same impact without what came before.Even though this is a crazy, overblown movie about a psycho killer, it only uses that as framework to address more universal issues of abuse, authority, dependency and responsibility.I don't usually write reviews here.

This is a collection of 11 short stories directed by indie stalwart Jim Jarmusch (""Strangers in Paradise"", ""Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai"") that have been filmed over the last 18 years, all of which involve two or more characters simply sitting at a table, conversing over...yep, coffee and cigarettes. In the hands of a lesser director that might be extremely boring, but Jarmusch is a master of subtle understatement and great deadpan humor. This may be one of the funniest movies you've ever seen in which no one cracks a smile. Almost all the actors play themselves, which adds a meta-theatrical, slightly surreal touch to it all. Among my favorite stories are one in which an overly eager Alfred Molina has a surprise in store for coolly arrogant fellow actor Steve Coogan and a great one in which Cate Blanchett plays both herself and her jealous cousin Shelby. Then there's the one where Tom Waits and Iggy Pop meet in a dive bar to discuss things and have a smoke (to celebrate quitting smoking), Jack and Meg White of the White Stripes experimenting with a Tesla coil, and in the funniest casting, RZA and GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan sharing some downtime with, of all people, Bill Murray. I also like the one with Spike Lee's twin siblings, Joie and Cinque, dealing with an invasive waiter (a hilarious Steve Buscemi). Almost all the stories are excellent, but there are three that are very forgettable and pretty unnecessary, and they're all in a row, which disrupts the flow of the film. If those three had been taken out, ""Coffee and Cigarettes"" would be just about perfect, but it's still really good. And those three are out of the way in the first half, anyway. For the first hour the movie feels mainly just like fun. Straight-faced, deadpan, B&W comedy just like ""Strangers In Paradise"". But as it goes on, and strange connections are made between the stories, it seems to have a sudden dreamlike depth to it. The final story in particular, in which two old men in a dark room (Bill Rice and Taylor Mead) discuss life while on a coffee break that feels like it'll last forever, has a distinct ""Waiting For Godot"" feel and ends the movie on a perfect note of haunting, existential sadness. It was at that point that I realized I hadn't just watched a string of jokey short stories, but a string of jokey short stories that say a lot about human nature and life in general. And if that's not enough to interest you, how often do you get to see Tom Waits and Iggy Pop have a conversation? Or RZA, GZA, and Bill Murray?","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg4MmFiNDAtYWIyYi00Mjg5LWFjMzYtYzc1YTcyODBiNTNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

That scene brought back every hope and dream I could remember as a 15 year old in love with a girl in my class I would never have. It was a validation of all those wonderful daydreams you had at that age and the hope that sprung from them. It was a moment that would send that pang in your heart to heights it's never known.You're never in love like you are at that age - and when you watch a film like this where you can become so completely involved in the life and emotions of a girl like Agnes - and see her greatest hope realized after a day of humiliation and pain - your heart soars. In fact, I can't think of a moment in a movie that is as perfect as this one.There's a universal quality to the feelings this film evokes that will pull in everyone who has a heart. I'm many years beyond high school - and of the opposite sex of the two protagonists in the film - and I still can't help but identify completely with this movie. Much of this has to do with the two actresses in the lead roles. Where did this director find these two phenomenal actresses? Rebecca Liljeberg has such a quiet and powerful range. Watching her react to other characters is one of the great pleasures of this film. Alexandra DahlstrÃÂ¶m takes a role that, in anyone else's hands would be either shallow or unbearable, and makes a character so complete, beautifully vulnerable and full of life you can understand why everyone loves her. These two girls - they are so wonderful, expressive and real you just want to hug them. I saw this film when it came to New York, loved it then when i saw it once during what seemed like only a two week run, then recently remembered it and rented it. I have seen it 5 times since and I'm sure I'll see it many times more. It is a film that transcends gender, sexual orientation and age. And for all you English language folks out there (I'm one of you), the subtitles will not be a drawback. In fact, watching this film in it's native language brings you even closer to these characters when you realize how familiar life is as a human being, no matter where we're from. How much we all have in common when it comes to matters of the heart. It's a nice little extra to be reminded of, since it's something we sometimes tend to forget.My praise cannot be more genuine, heartfelt and complete. Get this film. Your day will be made by it. You'll be telling your friends about it. In a busy life where there's a lot of distraction, you'll remember for a moment how wonderful it is to be alive and in love - and how that's worth everything in the world.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjMwODBmMWMtYzg5OS00MWZmLTljM2EtYWI4Zjc3ZmU4ZWFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg3MTIwODI@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

John Stryker is hated and feared by his men, who see him as a cold-hearted sadist. But when their boots hit the beaches, they begin to understand the reason for Stryker's rigid form of discipline.","72","Exploiting A Symbol","Although Clint Eastwood's recent Flags of Our Fathers has told the real story about the flag raising at Iwo Jima, it hasn't diminished any of the impact that Sands of Iwo Jima has, either back when it was released or viewed today.In fact because the three surviving flag raisers, Joseph Bradley, Rene Gagnon, and Ira Hayes all were in this film it's even more proof of how the symbolic flag raising has become mythologized.Of course the real heroism was in capturing the island that was less than a 1000 miles from the main islands of Japan and the airfields on Iwo Jima that could be used by our bombers for land based flights. It took about a month to do that, the flag was raised on the fifth day.I read a history of the United States Marine Corps from it's formation during the American Revolution. Over the course of its history it was interesting to learn that the Marines many times were threatened with extinction, to be folded into either the army or navy right up to and including World War I.Right after World War I a very farsighted man named John A. Lejeune became the Marine Corps Commandant and he saw that we would be in a war in the Pacific with the Japanese as our foes. He also saw that the survival of the Marines as an entity involved them training for a very specialized kind of mission, amphibious warfare. He started training them for that and come World War II they were certainly ready. John Wayne as Sergeant Striker got one of his most memorable parts of his career in Sands of Iwo Jima. Striker is a tough as nails Marine Corps lifer whose got a job to whip a lot of recruits into shape for the later Pacific landings after Guadalcanal. He's also got one lousy personal life as his wife's left him and taken their son.Wayne got his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor in this part. There's a couple of other films he should have gotten a nomination for, but that's another story. Among his competition in 1949 was Kirk Douglas for Champion, Richard Todd for The Hasty Heart, and Gregory Peck for Twelve O'Clock High. Note three of the nominees were for World War II related films. But the winner that year was Broderick Crawford for All the King's Men. At least Peck and Wayne both got Oscars later in their careers.John Agar who was trying to carve out a reputation as being more than Mr. Shirley Temple back then plays the son of a former commander of Wayne's who has a problem with his Dad and takes it out on Wayne attitude wise as a surrogate father. Julie Bishop and Adele Mara play women drawn to both Wayne and Agar respectively.Of the supporting cast who play members of Wayne's platoon, my favorite is Wally Cassell, the wisecracking city kid who finds a tank to help his platoon out during a sticky situation.Flags of Our Fathers teaches us about how the flag raising symbolism became part of the Marine Corps heritage. Sands of Iwo Jima exploits that symbol in the best sense of the word. After almost sixty years, it's still a fine film with a grand performance by the Duke.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzgxNGY1OWUtMTg1ZS00NjlhLWFjYzYtMjA0MzI1YzFlYTZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

To help her shed her inhibitions and rekindle their relationship, the professor records his sexual fantasies in a diary.","8","What do you expect from the guy who brought us ""Caligula"" and ""Salon Kitty?""","A main female character sums up this pile of narrative nonsense at the conclusion of the film saying something like, ""I was faithful by being unfaithful.""  Meaning she was compliant in her husband's wishes for her to link up with their son-in-law so her horny husband could become sexually excited by watching her, thus sparking their marriage alive again.  Set against Mussolini's rise to power in 1940s Italy, I suppose auteur Tinto Brass is trying to make some haughty comment on how the Italian populace of the time, repressed by Catholic guilt, succumbed to Il Duce's desire for them to fall faithfully in line with Italian pride and become unfaithful from the moral direction of the Church.  Who knows really, because Brass is more concerned with Stefania Sandrelli's derriere than he is about political/spiritual ambivalence.Alas, Mr. Brass' focus on lead actress Sandrelli's bottom is the only theme you're bound to come away with after viewing an hour and 50 minutes of this soft-core cornfest.  British thesp Frank Finlay takes a leap at a starring role by heading south to Italy and being forced to look every bit the dirty old man under the meticulous kink direction by Brass.  As the premature, if you will, hubby in this standard menage a trois, he can only last a matter of seconds in the sack with his much younger wife, played by the suitably stunning Sandrelli.  It is only when he becomes jealous over his wife's attentions to his son-in-law, played with robot-amateur woodenness by Franco Branciaroli, that Finlay becomes excited enough to maintain another kind of woodenness.  By drugging his wife into a fitful slumber and picture-posing her in various open positions for photo-ops, Frank cements our disgusted feeling that we are somehow watching the actual sad home life of the Italian Pinto, Tinto.While nowhere near as decadent as ""Caligula,"" ""La Chiave"" has that movie's ability to make you want to take a cleansing shower afterwards to wash its depressing, sleazy drivel off your conscience.  Once we learn the designs of Finlay's ho-hum plan, in the first 20 minutes, all we're left with is countless meandering soft-focus shots of Sandrelli and Branciaroli strolling around Venice, fornicating in their hideaway lair, and Finlay foppishly sniffing after her like a pheremone-obsessed hounddog.The fast-forward button won't help you on this one.

Today, it's the kitsch value that I really like, I mean, there's something incredibly cute and sexy about 60's women in futuristic garb.  There is a conflict in the movie about the tone; is it a sci-fi thriller with action and danger, or a tongue in cheek effort (with Moonopoly even)?  The effects are good in some areas and really poor in others; but apart from 2001 you can say that about most sci fi films of that era.  It shares something else with 2001 that other more famous sci-fi movies don't and that's no sound in a vacuum.  Full credit to the film makers that they paid attention to their science.  In fact, the movie script has some basis in real science about conditions on the moon and in space (groovy sequence of a spacesuit puncture causing the crushing of a hired goon).  So we have no noise in a vacuum, but do they give us just silence? No, they fill the soundtrack with what can be only described as the kind of music known as Porno-Jazz.  No matter, I actually like that kind of stuff.

"I tre volti della paura","1998.0","","92.0","Horror","7.0","82.0","Mario Bava","MichÃÂ¨le Mercier, Lidia Alfonsi, Boris Karloff, Mark Damon","13,950","Boris Karloffhosts a trio of horror stories concerning a stalked call girl, a vampire-like monster who preys on his family, and a nurse who is haunted by her ring's rightful owner.","96","3 Tales of Fear","I Tre Volti Della Paura/Black Sabbath(1963) starts out with a colorful introduction by Boris Karloff that gives homage to Sydney Greenstreet's introduction for the trailers of The Maltese Falcon(1941), and Across the Pacific(1942).  One of the best horror film anthologies of the 20th Century. An example of Mario Bava's love for the art of painting and the realm of fantasy.  Quentin Tarantino was influenced by Black Sabbath(1963) for his structure of Pulp Fiction(1994).  Black Sabbath(1963) is at its most artful and scary in its original Italian edition.THE TELEPHONE is the third best tale but the most historical in the evoluation of the Italian thriller.  Although not the first Giallo to be made in Italy, its certainly the first Giallo to be done in color.  Also, the first Giallo to have the eroticism and violent  outbursts of the Italian novel known as the gialli.  Takes place in one area with the exception of a couple of scenes.  This gives the story a touch of the theatre.Michele Mercier as Rosy is absolutely stunning.  The lesbian subtext of THE TELEPHONE was a darling concept that was too erotic for American audiences to watch as thought out by AIP before the film's USA release.  This taboo subtext was cut and the story was turned into a ghost yarn in the American version.  Gives hints of why Rosy and her friend Mary stopped seeing each other.  THE TELEPHONE uses the colors of blue and red to express the sexual and violent tension of the story.The final shot of the telephone with the receiver out and a body on the floor below would be used again in the final shot of Blood & Black Lace(1965).  THE TELEPHONE contains features that would appear at the beginning of Scream(1996).  In fact, the opening scene of Scream(1996) is almost a shot by shot remake of THE TELEPHONE.  Influenced Mario Bava's Blood & Black Lace(1965) and the gory body countish Bay of Blood(1971). A murder by strangulation with telephone cord would appear later in A Bay of Blood with the murder of the entomologist.THE WURDALAK is a tragic tale of family decline.  Its also the most romantic of the three tales.  The romantic subplot involving Count D'Uree and Sdenka is reminiscent of The Mask of Satan(1960).  About a Russian version of the vampire known as the Wurdalak who drains the blood of loved ones so they too can be Wurdalak.  The most personal story of Mario Bava in this anthology.Boris Kalfoff gives his best performance in a horror film since playing the creature in Frankenstein(1931) and Bride of Frankenstein(1933).  THE WURDALAK is very similar to Edgar Allen Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher.  Based on a novel that was later filmed as a full length movie. The scene of the ghost child turning into Gorca to hunt Gregor's wife would influence Kill Baby Kill(1967) and Shock(1977).  Mario Bava directs THE WURDALAK with an atmospheric touch.Despite the film's low budget, THE WURDALAK has excellent costume and set designs.  Mark Damon and Susy Andersen are good in their roles as doomed lovers.  This segment of Black Sabbath(1963) would be of significance to later Bava films I.E, The Whip & the Body(1964), Kill Baby Kill(1967), Lisa & the Devil(1974), and Shock(1977).  The line ""My Destiny is here"" personifies Bava's life as a homebody and is similar to a couple of lines from The Mask of Satan(1960) and Lisa & the Devil(1974).  A good short story that is not boring.A DROP OF WATER is the most frightening and scary story of Black Sabbath(1963).  Its one of the best and perhaps the greatest horror story Mario Bava has ever filmed.  In this story, Bava was interested in the idea of a person alone in a dark room.  The story is about a nurse who thinks a dead medium patient is after her for stealing a ring.  A DROP OF WATER is brilliant in exploring the theme of fear.A DROP OF WATER contains spine tingling sequences of horror and atmospheric lighting.  Jacqueline Pierreux is fabulous as the fearful and guilt conscious nurse, Helen Corey.  She plays Helen Corey with believability. The story is ambiguous on whether the ghost is real or is just in Helen Corey's mind.  A DROP OF WATER  is a true horror tale that plays on the imagination of the audience brilliantly unlike the overrated, Blair Witch Project(1999).The end suggests that the same events will occur all over again.  Filmed by Mario Bava with an expertise in horror and terror.  A DROP OF WATER was influenced by Bava's love of Russian literature especially the works of Nikolai Gogol, Fyodor Dostoevsky and also the short stories of Edgar Allen Poe.  In the same manner and vein as The Tell Tale Heart.  The theme of guilt in A DROP OF WATER shows up in The Whip & the Body(1964) plus Shock(1977).","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWVhMzM5ZDktY2Y5Zi00NmJjLThkNWItNzdmYjI2ZmU4ZGM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Usually I've known in advance his movies would be bad but ""Cleaner"" seemed that it might actually be really good for a change. It's not really bad, but it isn't anything great either.Samuel L. Jackson and Ed Harris did their job very well in the leading roles and Harlin's direction was also good. Eva Mendes' performance wasn't anything to hooray for though. The movie started off well and I thought to myself: ""This might be it. The movie that puts Renny back on the top."", but sadly no. The script is just too basic. You've seen different versions of this script on the screen many many times before. The characters and the world they live in might be totally different, but it's still the same generic plot. One thing that bugged me a bit was the musical score which didn't fit in some places at all.But as far as Harlin's movies go this is one of his better ones.

You may also have to be, or have been, a Marine to fully appreciate the film (although anyone that has lived under authoritarian rule must feel some sympathy for the situations presented).Although the film may have been re-cut for video release, I remember Duvall's character as being a fully fleshed out dichotomy of a man who rebelled against authority when submission was called for (his practical jokes while performing military duties) and invoking authoritarianism when more compassion and understanding were called for (his family life).This is what it was like to be a Marine:  The Corps was your family and your family was just an inconvenient duty to be performed for society.If the movie has been re-edited, I suggest you try to see the original theatrical release, if possible.

I am not a big fan of Mel Gibson, I thought that he is just average but too overrated actor. So you can understand why I didn't expect too much from this movie. But now, I want to apologize to Mr. Gibson. In this overlooked masterpiece he proves himself incredibly good both as an actor also as a director. The story was absolutely great, realistic and touching. Relations between two main characters ÃÂ former teacher and young student boy (perfectly played by Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl) were shown as great as it possible. It was for sure best Mel Gibson performance ever. Young Nick Stahl acting also looked incredibly good as Chuck Norstadt. All supporting casts also did a very good job in their roles Director and whole cast team brought to us incredibly powerful atmosphere of total misunderstanding in Chuck family and in the whole town. People can't understand and worst of all they don't want to understand other people, who are not like all ordinary people in their small town. If you're not like all ÃÂ you're odd and nothing more. This movie teach us never judge people only by appearance and groundless suspicions, teach us always look inside the people. It was very strong, powerful and important messages. All dialogs were very well written and very memorable. In addition to this cinematography and soundtrack were very good.So, I consider The Man Without a Face as a stunning excellent film, best Mel Gibson film, one the best of the year and one of the best movies I've ever seen. If you're a Mel Gibson fan or simply love films with excellent story and perfect acting I highly recommend this film.

Things get complicated when a desperado named Silas Selleck (Michael Fassbender) decides to accompany Cavendish on his journeyÃ¢ÂÂpossibly to cash in on a bounty that hangs over Rose's head. Taking a cue from neo-westerns like Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man, Slow West uses the chaotic landscape of the American frontier as an allegorical exploration of love and death. There is something surreal about seeing the old west interpreted through the lens of New Zealand where the film was shot, and it added to the story's dreamlike tone. The immensely watchable Fassbender exudes some serious Han Solo vibes as he guides Cavendish through the unforgiving wilderness while trying to act like he doesn't give a crap. McPhee's boyish, innocent appearance is ideal for a character whose belief in true love has guided him so far into the lions' den. While the film's ending is sure to polarize audiences, it was a ballsy way to emphasize the point that the frontier was an ecosystem all its own, indiscriminately filling some hearts with purpose and others with bullets.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTYxNDA5ODk5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMwMzIwNTE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

One can pay attention only to the visuals, only to the minute trivia related to actors and actresses, to the most obvious displays of physical action, to appeals to one's sympathies, or to the underlying content and profundity trying to be expressed and communicated to the viewer. Thus, films can be judged to fail on the one hand when they succeed on the other, and this, I think, explains the lukewarm response to what is the finest films ever made in the English language. Whether or not Richard Burton always plays a drunk, whether or not it should have been in colour, are not in the least bit relevant to the significance, the concepts and the issues at play in this brilliant film, this monument to the resilience of human souls, to the compassion that can bring such succour on long, tortured nights, to the precious decency that is for some a perpetual struggle to attain, and the search, the life-long search, for belief, love and light.The backdrop to the exploration of these issues that are so fundamental to individual lives is a Mexican coastal hotel. The central character is a de-frocked and unstable priest, T. Lawrence Shannon (Richard Burton) who, like the iguana that is tethered up in preparation to being eaten, is at the end of his rope. He walks alone, without the crutch of facile beliefs or human companionship beyond sterile physical conquests which only serve to heighten his own self-loathing and isolation. He arrives at the hotel in search of sanctuary in light of his mental deterioration. On his arrival he meets his old friend, the lascivious but no less desperate Maxine (Ava Gardner), a poet on the verge of death who is nevertheless striving for one last creative act, one last stab at beautiful self-expression, and his grand-daughter Hannah (Deborah Kerr), a resilient woman painfully trying to reconcile herself to loss, loneliness and the bitter struggle she faces with her own personal demons. They are united in that they are divided, in that they are all tortured souls seeking beauty, life, meaning and engaged in battles to stand tall, to live with integrity and love. On a hot, cloying night, a night of the iguana, when all their ropes snap taut, they meet.The pivotal and most crucial part of this film is the conversation between Lawrence and Hannah. The former is in the throes of a nervous breakdown, the latter has survived and endured through the same. They are kindred souls that aid one another through the therapy of human connection, of empathy in the long, lonely walk. It is in this conversation that Tennessee Williams explores the issues make this film so important: through his characters, who are throughout depicted not as mere shallow cliches but individuals with histories and feelings that run deep, with subtleties that bring them to life, he meditates upon the struggle to find meaning in one's life, the need for companionship, the importance of compassion, and the way in which people endure, all the time grasping at what dignity they may have, and which may be forever threatened by trials, doubts and pain. These are not issues that date, that diminish in relevance, or that relate only to certain people - they are concepts that are universal, that speak to each individual and relate to fundamental facets of the human mind and spirit.Because Night of the Iguana sets out to tackle such issues, it is elevated far beyond the level of most films. It is profound, but also deeply emotional, made more so by the superb characterisations (aided, in addition, by universally superb performances). One is afforded an insight into characters, into people, who live, breath, cry, shout, scream, and endure. They are fallible, capable of spite, caprice, and baseness, but they are also thoughtful, courageous and strangely noble. To watch them interact, thrown together as they are on a Mexican veranda, is affecting both emotionally and intellectually, and it is this interaction which is responsible for creating a film that stands (tall and dignified) above nearly all others.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTJiMDAyNzctMTBhYi00OTQ4LWEyNGMtYzI5M2MzNDA0YjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyOTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This is disentertainment.","I saw 'Begotten' last night, and I'm of two minds on the film.On one hand, I appreciate it for being the total invert of a Michael Bay film. No dialogue, extremely stylized grainy B&W photography, some of the most genuinely horrific imagery ever set to film, and a very compelling use of sound (which nobody else seems to have really picked up on yet). It's a reflection on a theme, and it dares go where most filmmakers do not not only in terms of images, but of production and concept. It's a movie that most people don't understand, and if you read through these comments you'll find a lot of people whose lack of ability to figure this film out results in them shrieking about 'pretentiousness' with the fervor of a gibbon rattling the bars of its cage at feeding time. It genuinely shocked and disturbed me, and the last time a film managed to do that was a while ago. On the other, this is a thirty-minute short that sprawls out to over an hour and a half. I understand that there might be artistic merit in using repetition and monolithic pacing as a bludgeon, but in this case it just doesn't help everything hang together. Imagine being approached by a ragged man on the street who grabys you by the shoulders and says something that completely confounds the core of your being... but then, instead of leaving your shattered and gibbering in his wake, he just keeps talking and talking and talking. By the end of the movie, I found myself glancing at my watch now and again. This is not entertainment, people. This is disentertainment. This is how you deprogram people who just watched ""Glitter."" If you watch movies to be entertained, this will frustrate, confound, and possibly anger you. You don't approach 'Begotten' like a chocolate cake you want to eat because it tastes good. You approach it like something on the menu you have never heard of before, something you see furtive glances of through the kitchen door, something that's dark and glistens and twitches on its platter; something you order not because it will taste good, but because you just have to know what it's like.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MTQ2MTgwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQ5MjgxMQ@@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

While the cast may be youthful, the characters and story set this film way above ""teen"" slasher or horror flicks.  Mainly, because this is really a mystery in the vein of Ten Little Indians. It's a good thing I saw this film in a theatre when it was first released in 1986 -- because the VHS cover has something on it that would have kept me AWAY if I had not seen the film already: ""It's just what you'd expect from the producer who brought you Friday the 13th -- Parts Two, Three, Four, and Five.""  You just can't put April Fool's Day in the same category as those films! This is far superior in story and intelligence.  It's clever, well-written, and has great characters that you like even if they are not so nice!  These days it seems it's more important to find the most popular actors, and that is usually distracting and doesn't guarantee a good  film. April Fool's Day had lesser known stars for that time (Deborah Foreman, Amy Steel, Clayton Rohner, Griffin O'Neal) and that worked as an advantage. The basic premise of a group of college students stuck on an island in a big house and one by one they disappear, yes, it's been done in many variations before.  But the clever execution of the story, red herrings, and the underrated Deborah Foreman's delightful portrayal of Muffy/Buffy all make for a really fun viewing experience. Foreman has just the right amount of sweetness and can go right into being just plain quirky with such ease. The touch of having dolls on the dinner table, sort of like name tags, will bring a giggle and a smile for sure! One plus for this film is the fact that it didn't sink into the tiring T & A route.  Sure, a few of the characters have sex on the brain but their actions and dialogue never really wander off into the gratuitous area. Guys, if you really want lots of breasts than just go ahead and get some porn or a Playboy video, okay?  Let the rest of us enjoy a good story once in a while! After the body count rises and things escalate into a tense and frenzied chase through the house, you'll be surprised at what happens next.  April Fool's Day is one of the few films of this kind that actually had a very surprising reveal and I was even caught off guard, left with my jaw agape at what the whole deal was about. The BIG surprise just happens so...abruptly, that you feel just like the character that runs into the room -- just stuck for a second! After about 90 minutes of mystery, the payoff BETTER be good, and sure enough,  this one doesn't disappoint! I'm especially thrilled to have picked up the eerie soundtrack by Charles Bernstein on vinyl when it first came out, and to this day love to give it a spin on the turntable. Paramount has a vast library of films that just NEED to be given great treatment on DVD, and I'm crossing my fingers that films like April Fool's Day, Let's Scare Jessica To Death, and Polanski's film The Tenant will be given their glory.  >","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjI5ODIxYjktMGU3Ny00MmZmLWIyYzUtMmQ0ZjIzNzUwNWVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Vincente Minelli did a superlative job of direction, and the cast simply could not be bettered. Judy Garland gives what I feel is the most relaxed and charming performance of her career, and sings like an angel, not like the jittery bundle of nerves she would become in later life.  Tom Drake is very winning as the ""Boy Next Door"" we should all be so lucky to have.  But Margaret O'Brien absolutely steals the picture as the adorable but irrepressibly morbid Tootie, a refreshing change from the normally saccharine moppets of Hollywood's golden years.  Marjorie Main also swipes  a scene or two as the mouthy cook, and Mary Astor and Leon Ames give sterling support as the parents.

Schaffner","Michael Jayston, Janet Suzman, Roderic Noble, Ania Marson","5,573","Tsar Nicholas II, the inept last monarch of Russia, insensitive to the needs of his people, is overthrown and exiled to Siberia with his family.","65","Among the last of the ""thinking man's epics"" and one of the best.","At the time of it's release in December of 1971, ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" must have seemed like an anachronistic piece of film-making, especially when compared with fellow Best Picture Nominees, ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""The French Connection"" and ""The Last Picture Show"". Based on a best-selling work of popular history, it was film making on a grand scale, boasting for it's cast a veritable who's who of the English speaking stage, a sweeping love story spanning many years, thrown over thousands of miles, using the conflict of World War I and the Russian Revolution as it's background. It must have seemed to many like the best film David Lean never made. And superficially it does resemble Lean's epic of a few years earlier, ""Doctor Zhivago"". Indeed three of Lean's close associates, Producer Sam Spiegel, Production Designer John Box, and Cinematographer, Freddie Young all shine in this production. Unfortunately having arrived late in the historical epic film cycle, it was largely dismissed at the time of it's release by critics, but time has revealed it's many virtues. Produced with lavish care and attention to detail by Sam Spiegel for Horizon Pictures, ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" is among the last of the great ""thinking man's epics"" and one of the best. This is due in no small measure to the wonderful screenplay by James Goldman. Goldman, who also scripted ""The Lion in Winter"" and ""Robin and Marian"" had a fine ear for dialogue, and ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" is a pleasure to listen to as well as to behold. Like Robert Bolt's ""Lawrence of Arabia"", Charles Wood's ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" and Robert Ardrey's ""Khartoum"", all fine historical epics, Goldman's ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" is elevated by an intelligent script laced with fine dialogue. Transposing history onto the screen is never an easy task, but the story of the last years of the Romanov Dynasty is well served by Goldman. He skillfully telescopes events, while still remaining basically true to historic fact. One way or another, all films dealing with history compromise fact for drama. The best of them achieve a balance between the two. Those pedants who quibble over this fact of life, please refer to the historical plays of Shakespeare for it's validation.Among the film's many pleasures is the high level of acting by an impressive cast. Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman are simply magnificent in the lead roles. It was an uncanny and bold choice using two unknowns to star in a film of this scope, and they have no problems carrying the three hour film. Both create complex, three-dimensional characters, deeply flawed, yet appealing, sympathetic and infuriating. it is the film's unwillingness to portray them as simply victims that gives it tragic grandeur. A special note must be made of Tom Baker's performance as Rasputin. Too often in previous movies film-makers have exploited the sensational events of the man's life and nothing more. This film actually had the courage to downplay those lurid elements, striving instead for complexity of character. Here we have a tortured individual, a charlatan and a monk, lascivious yet craving spiritual redemption. The Imperial Children are also sensitively depicted, with a standout performance by Roderic Noble as the hemophiliac only son, Alexis. The internal angst he brings to the part in his later scenes is impressive. Franklin J. Schaffner's able direction keeps the film moving along, and at no time is there any danger of the film losing focus on the two leads. This was no mean feat considering the powerhouse supporting cast that included, Laurence Olivier, Michael Redgrave, Harry Andrews, Irene Worth, Jack Hawkins, Ian Holm, Michael Bryant, Brian Cox, Eric Porter, Timothy West, Peter McEnery, Julian Glover, Roy Dotrice, Maurice Denham, Alan Webb, Guy Rolfe, Steven Berkof and John Wood, all of whom do memorable turns.In the first half of the movie, the filmmakers vividly bring to life the isolated fairy-tale world the Imperial Family inhabited. The beautiful palaces, and villas provide a striking contrast to the shabby, squalid prison quarters of the film's second half, which deals largely with the Romanov's exile and imprisonment in Siberia. The murder of the Royal Family in the basement of the Ipatiev house, the so called ""House of Special Purpose"" is one of the most strikingly directed scenes in the film. The brutal suddenness with which it is depicted packs quite a wallop. Filmed in Panavision, the film is gorgeous to look at. John Box's recreation of Imperial Russia at the turn of the century truly deserved it's Academy Award for Best Production Design, as did Yvonne Blake for Best Costume Design. Freddie Young's stunning cinematography and Richard Rodney Bennett's haunting music score were also nominated, though they both lost to other films. Finally it is a beautifully edited film, a marvelous example of invisible editing used to create a subtle, but powerful sense of irony. A superb film that deals intelligently with the problems inherent in transposing history onto film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjNiZmU0MDYtMmQwNi00OWY3LTg4MWItYTIyOTFkYTJiMWFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Rection, and Brad Lovett, but if you are willing to set your brain on neutral for an hour and a half, you WILL be entertained.Basically the four guys, after failing grade 12 four times, are sent to Coxwell Academy for the summer as a last chance to get their high school diplomas.  Their teenage libidos raging, the four quickly start a game to see who can score with the most girls that summer.  It is best summarized by Brad, who offers, ""10 points for every girl you score with, 5 for an almost, and 2 for a look-see.""  in their own creative ways, the four embark on a sexual journey full of mishaps and hilarity.As an interesting side note, Canadian comedian Mike Macdonald fills the role of Principal Arsenault, out to ensure the boys' summer is a living hell. Vying for the affection of both the principal and the guys is the French Teacher, Mona Lott (yes, that is her real name).  Again, more hilarity ensues.This movie is absolutely ridiculous, but outrageously funny.  Granted, many of the jokes are rehashed from the original ""Screwballs"", ""Loose Screws"" offers its own unique take on a strip club journey, beach party, sneaking a boy into the girls' dorm, and a thrilling 'climax' at the end.  Come on, how can a guy pretending to be a girl who is forced to have a bath, only to find a single tub left that he must share with an innocent co-ed who happens to be blinded by her missing glasses not funny?On top of all this, the soundtrack is amazing, featuring such classics as The Extras ""Circular Impression"", ""Screw It"" and ""Loose Screws.""

I'm so pleased that there's finally a decent movie about soccer, a sport which for the longest time, doesn't seem to get movie producers excited to put out on screen. Having FIFA sanction this film means getting some realism injected, and lending to the authenticity of is the English Premier League club Newcastle United, together with a host of real life soccer superstars like Beckham, Zidane and Raul.While the settings and the game results are real, we follow the fictional story of an illegal Mexican immigrant to Los Angeles, Santiago Munez, street footballer extrodinaire. He gets his lucky break when an ex-Newcastle United player turned scout, Glen Foy, chances upon his games, and invites him over to England for trials.For a guy who's struggling to make ends meet, this presents the perfect opportunity to take a stab at his dream. But tension builds as his father disapproves and is skeptical at both the chance as well as his son's gift to make it big. So he leaves his real dad and family behind, to follow in the footsteps of Foy, his surrogate father in England.The highlight of the movie is not the real football games that the actors get seamlessly transplanted onto, but rather the many trials and tribulations that Munez goes through to earn his rightful place in the squad. His disastrous first appearance almost made him take the first plane home, and I'd bet many in the audience thought it would be a breeze actually for him to make it to first team. Thankfully, the focus was on his sheer determination to overcome the lack of niceties towards newcomer rookies like himself, and the difficulties and temptations which fill his 30 days trial that Foy literally begged for.What you read in the papers of the decadent lifestyle of footballers are all in here - the booze, the parties, the clubbing, the women, even video games (taking a stab at David James maybe?). Munez gets introduced to these by fellow teammate and cocky new German acquisition Gavin Harris, whose partying lifestyle takes a toll on his game, and becomes the Toon Army's boo-boy. It's fantastic how these two characters contrast each other, and help each other along the way.For non-fans of the beautiful game, fear not, you're not gonna be alienated in this movie, as it doesn't sink into technicalities like the dreaded offside rule. You'll enjoy the movie simply because of the strong human drama weaved into the story, as well as the familiarity of easily identifiable themes of hard work, right ethics, living your dreams and fulfilling your aspirations.Newcastle fans however, will rejoice, as the hallowed grounds of St James Park gets put on the silver screen. For fans without the opportunity of visiting their beloved club, they can gawk at the dressing room, the gym, the dugout, the pitch up close, the city neighbourhood, and ""mingle"" with fellow fanatical Geordies. Club captain Alan Shearer makes appearances too, as do the many other first team players. But the screen version of the club manager looks uncannily modelled after Arsenal's Arsene Wenger. Fans of Fulham, Chelsea and Liverpool can also see their heroes on screen as well.Santiago Munez is played by a relative newcomer, Mexican actor Kuno Becker, who was put on real soccer training to improve his skills and make him look credible and natural with the ball at his feet. At certain angles with his short crop, he looks like Michael Owen, who now is playing for Newcastle (he wasn't when this movie was filmed).I so dig the soundtrack, especially the guitar piece which opened the movie, and track from the trailer which also made its way into the movie - Kasabian's Club Foot, and various pieces by Brit-band Oasis. A pity it's only out in the stores on October 16 (based on Amazon), but I'll be there to pick it up when it hit the shelves.The ending, even though it wrapped up all the pieces nicely, is a bit abrupt, but I guess it would lead directly into the planned sequels of a trilogy, which involve Real Madrid and the World Cup. This is one movie which can spark someone's interest in soccer, and I'd recommend it to both fans and non-fans alike. Don't let this movie dribble past you!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNDk2Njk1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE5MzIzMQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"
"Salvador","1995.0","A","122.0","Drama, History, Thriller","7.4","69.0","Oliver Stone","James Woods, Jim Belushi, Michael Murphy, John Savage","23,183","A burnt-out photojournalist becomes involved in a Central American revolution.","101","Compelling Film About the Intersection Between Journalistic Ethics and Politics","Going back and watching Salvador makes me realize how long it's been since Oliver Stone has been on his game. How long has it been since he made a film that actually required the audience to think. It's not that he's suddenly become loud and bombastic, it's that he's suddenly stopped doing anything genuinely provocative. Natural Born Killers, for example, is *not* a provocative film. It's a loud and angry and aggressive film. However, the film produced only attacks on the filmmaker (or rather excessive adulation for Stone) and never really stimulated an intelligent national debate. But Salvador, based on the true experiences of photojournalist Rick Boyle, is Stone at his best. It's complicated and full of the mixture of regret, guilt, nostalgia, and outrage that fill the director's landmarks (JFK or Platoon, for example). After all of the violence and horror, it becomes a film about representations of reality and the different reasons for distorting truth.Rick Boyle (James Woods) is at the end of his rope. He's unemployed, his wife just left him. And he's just been thrown in jail for a litany of driving violations. After getting bailed out by his tubby friend Doctor Rock (James Belushi in the role he was probably born to play), he hops in his unregistered car that he isn't licensed to drive, and he heads south to El Salvador. His only companions are Doctor Jack, his alcohol, and his drugs on a journey that can't help but be likened to the drive to Vegas in Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. When he arrives in El Salvador, he finds the country torn apart with leftist rebels fleeing to the hills and a country braced for a bloody ""democratic"" election in which a murderous American puppet general will likely be elected. Boyle tries to use his connections to get a press pass and get one last shot to become a success. This is made easier by the Salvadorian woman who loves him and the ace photographer who lends him a hand (John Savage).But not everybody in El Salvador is supportive of the loose cannon journalist. There's the colonel who thinks he's a communist, the military attache who's using him for information, and the local military forces who resent the way Boyle depicted them in a previous campaign. The audience is supposed to be disgusted by the way that Boyle treats himself and those he loves, but there's one important fact that's repeated over and over: Boyle was the last journalist out of Cambodia. We know that he stayed to help save people. And it's just a matter of time before he becomes even more personally invested in what's happening in Central America. And that's when things go really crazy.The world of photojournalism depicted in the film is one step from public relations and sometimes not even that. Boyle's major supported among the military leaders is a general about whom Boyle had written a glowing profile. Boyle is also able to curry favor by showing his pictures to American military leaders before trying to publish them. The question that comes up, of course, is why are the pictures being taken at all and how can anybody ever know the truth of any war. Journalists, like everybody else, get caught up in their surroundings. Boyle may be supporting the right side in El Salvador, but he admits to having favored Pol Pot for a brief period years earlier. The difference between canonizing a truly noble leader (like the assassinated Archbishop Romero) and elevating a genocidal lunatic is a small one. Salvador calls into question how American audiences can ever know who to trust in a media covered war. On one hand we have Pauline Axelrod (Valerie Wildman) appearing on air because she's pretty and blond even though she just accepts the official statements as truth. Then there's also Savage's journalist who's willing to do anything to get the perfect shot, to create an image that shows both the conflict and the reasons behind it in a single frame. Idealism and self preservation are competing instincts.The film is pure Stone. The battle sequences are tense and tightly edited and the dialogue (which Stone cowrote with Rick Boyle) is rippingly good, for the most part. Then again, its misogyny is almost worn as a gold star, female characters are, as always, Madonnas or whores, and a rape scene is fairly exploitative. Also in a conversation between Boyle and a conservative US Colonel, Stone unpacks entirely too much of his personal ideology in a series of monologues. The message of the film, about not wanted to create another Vietnam and liberalism not being the same as Communism is much too literally articulated.The film basically hinges on Woods's wonderful performance. His typical manic energy perfectly fits his character's earliest incarnation,  but as Boyle becomes more troubled by what he sees around him, Woods's performance becomes deeper, richer, and more internalized. The rest of the cast has less to do and thus can't really be blamed for not standing out. Belushi's Doctor Jack has ""Fictitious Composite Character"" written all over him. Basically we watch as his story arc goes in opposite directions from Woods's at all times.Salvador is perhaps the only film to ever express nostalgia for Jimmy Carter. I like that. I like that it's challenging, dogmatic, but rarely insults my intelligence by saying things that I already know. This is a very fine 8/10 film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUwNzc1YTEtNWUzNi00MzZlLTk0NTctMzM2ODAxZTg4NzkyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTg2NTc4MzA@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Perhaps people are just obsessed with the lousy ""found footage"" atmosphere or the Ouija boards possessions. I thought it was a rather refreshing considering all the other flicks these days.

What other movie story is so exquisitely planned and executed?Margaret Sullaven isn't sexy, it's true, but this isn't a film about sex. It's about love in the human heart and mind.  A sexier actress would have thrown things out-of-balance.  As always, Lubitsch knew exactly what he was doing.  Just as he knew ace comedian Frank Morgan (the WIZARD OF OZ's Wizard) had hidden depth, which this film so beautifully reveals.They don't make them like this anymore -- they didn't make them like this back then, either.

Encumbered by women who must be evacuated, Brittles finds his mission imperiled.","110","Colorful Centerpiece of Cavalry Trilogy...","SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is, arguably, the most enduring and appealing of John Ford's 'Cavalry' trilogy. While lacking the dramatic core of a fatally flawed central character (FORT APACHE), or an estranged couple reunited by a headstrong son (RIO GRANDE), the film offers a richly sentimental tale of a crusty yet endearing career soldier (John Wayne)  facing retirement, in a romanticized West where the cavalry stands as the only defense against the combined might of the Indian nations. The combination of Wayne and the cavalry in SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is simply unbeatable!Wayne, at 42, portrays the sixty-ish Capt. Nathan Brittles, and under Ford's sure hand, is magnificent in the role. Whether chastising young lieutenants (""Never apologize, mister, it's a sign of weakness""), complimenting an enlisted man (""Keep it up, and you'll make a fine corporal, in three or four years""), or kneeling at the grave of his long-dead wife, to share the news of the day, Wayne's performance shows a subtlety and sensitivity that his critics often claimed he lacked. When his commander, Major Allshard (George O'Brien) refuses his request to rescue Lt. Cohill (John Agar) and two squads who had performed rear guard duty, the anguish Wayne shows is heartbreaking. This is an Oscar-caliber performance, from a vastly underrated actor.The rest of the cast measures up equally well. Victor McLaglen, as irascible as ever, plays Irish Top Sergeant Quincannon, full of blarney and (a bit of) whiskey. His morning scenes with Wayne, denying he'd been drinking, are comic gems. As the young suitors of Joanne Dru (who plays a more traditional role than in Howard Hawks' RED RIVER), Agar and Harry Carey Jr. are also quite good. The real 'find' of the film, however, is Ben Johnson, in only his second major role. As Sgt. Tyree, ex-Confederate captain, and Brittles' best scout, Johnson shows an easy-going charm, a (feigned) lack of respect (when asked his opinion, he'd always begin with ""That's not my department..."" then make a dead-on assessment), and astonishing riding skills (not surprising, as Johnson had been a champion rodeo rider). A future Oscar winner, he displays a charisma on-camera that would quickly earn him a place in the 'Ford Family' of actors. The visuals of SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON have been frequently compared to Fredric Remington's classic paintings of cavalrymen and Indians, and the comparison is justified; the film would win an Oscar for it's rich Technicolor photography, and images of 'dirty blue' riders on horseback against the stark blue sky and golden hues of Monument Valley are very reminiscent of the artist's work.SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is the kind of film you can watch again and again, and still find rewarding. It is on my 'short list' of favorite westerns, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTkyMTM3ZTMtMDc1Mi00ZjRmLTk3NWYtMzFlOGY3Mjg4Mzk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Especially Jim Deddes as Danny (reference to Vinyard from American History X?). He really did remind me of my brother back in the days, and as in American History X his little brother in this movie looks up to his brother while he actually shouldn't, albeit for different reasons.The only thing that bothered me were the insanely stupid choices the Danny character made.For international audiences, skinheads in this movie are not like American ones, it was style of the subculture like the Nikes and Australian tracksuits.In that regard the director also did an amazing job portraying Netherlands of the 90s.

While the film is based on a true story, the resulting product ends up being incredibly sappy and boring, with the some most predictable, by the numbers setups I've seen in years. The story follows Naomi Watts as Sam Bloom, who becomes permanently wheelchair bound after falling off a cliff during a family vacation. Sometime later in the story, her kids find an injured magpie, who they name ""Penguin"", (hence the title) who they decide to nurse back to health. Sam does not like this magpie, but grows closer with it throughout the movie. This is basically the extent of the film. The magpie wins the arbitrary prize for being the best actor in the film and is probably the most enjoyable aspect of it. Naomi Watts is a great actress, but does not deliver anything exceptional in this movie, the child performances are nothing of note, and Andrew Lincoln delivers a performance so excessive and overacted that his character ends up being totally unlikeable. In summary, the story was cheesy, the music was cheesy, the acting was cheesy, and the dialogue was cheesy, The rest of the movie is represented by the most boring and bland two slices of bread you have ever seen, and the magpie is a sprig of parsley to garnish the cheese sandwich that is Penguin Bloom.

This was the film that caused me to reconsider that practice. Of all the cinematic trainwrecks I've sat through, this was far and away the very worst.I don't even know if I can fully explain why. It's not just that it's essentially two hours of vomiting, disembowelment and cannibalism, interspersed with about the least erotic sex scenes ever committed to film. It's not even just that the above is shot in grainy black and white at torturously slow art-movie pacing (and I couldn't figure out, even at the time, if that made it better or worse). Or the atrociously bad acting. Or the barely existent plot.I think more than anything it's the sheer pointlessness of it all. Given how much time, money and energy it takes to make a feature-length film, you've got to ask: WHY? Why make a film like this? What on earth is the point? And 15 years after seeing it, I still have no answer to that.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM0ZDBhNjAtOTliOS00M2VmLTliN2YtOTIzNzlmYzU2NjMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODUyNTQyNTQ@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The opening half of the movie is very well developed. It draws out it's characters well, sets up moments of suspense for the horrors that will come, and keeps the viewer interested due to it's beautiful cinematography.Once the terror and violence actually begin (which doesn't happen until the last third of the movie no less) it goes way downhill. For one, it was marketed as a torture movie, but there is barely any of it! Sure, there's a brutal killing here and there, but when it came to gore, this film was very tame. Second, the cinematography in during the night scenes was awful,with the chase scenes and violence barely viewable. You could not tell what was happening on screen, and all of the viewers of the film were lost with what was going on. Third, the last third was extremely predictable. You could tell who was going to die and when. The main villain (who ironically looks like the President of Iran) is not well drawn out, and the ""climax"" of the film is pitiful.There is however, fine acting jobs done by all involved, and a particular death scene that made me squirm in my seat due to its brutality and intensity. When the chase scenes and violence were actually viewable (of which it rarely was) it actually was pretty intense. However, the actual deaths were not (save one or two), and the dumb decisions made by all of the characters may be the stupidest yet to grace the screen this year.It's sad. Turistas had potential. It started off great, but just went in the wrong direction I guess. I have never seen a movie that fell so much on its rear.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwNjAwOTAyMDdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDIyMTU1Nw@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The creature gives him a euphoric state of happiness but demands human victims in return.","60","Juice me up! Henenlotter's most entertaining work","Frank Henenlotter's 'Brain Damage' (1987) is easily the director's best film, esp. when considering the solid performances, technical proficiency and fascinating storyline.  Aylmer, a rather large, penis-shaped parasite, gives unsuspecting Brian brain damage by getting him hooked on an hallucinogenic, blue fluid that Aylmer himself produces.  Oh, the colors! But the thousand-year-old worm-like parasite demands something in return for the buzz - human brains!  Aylmer and his actions seem to be a metaphor for drug use and addiction and convey very graphically how substances foreign to our bodies can alter our own thoughts and actions. Henenlotter adds context and meaning to the proceedings by creating a history for Aylmer.  The parasite was sold and stolen over the centuries, until it finally ended up in the possession of Brian's neighbors.  But the neighbors deprived Aylmer of his needs in order to keep him weak, and that's where the story begins.  Henenlotter's films are never without heavy doses of sick humor, and the perverse highlight here is a sequence depicting a disco-whore getting her brains screwed out - literally - through her mouth. If that's not enough, the special effects in the restaurant scene, complete with spaghetti and brainballs, are particularly polished and satisfying. Ultimately, the director outplays his hand and is left with nowhere to go. Despite this weak ending, 'Brain Damage' is an odd, effective story and film, a major step up from the director's debut, 'Basket Case', but every bit as twisted.   >","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjIxOTJiM2UtMTFjYS00ZjMyLTg3MDQtNDc3M2Q3ZmI4NDQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

As a guy, this makes me very unusual to say the least. But even women, who are usually the most die-hard fans of this great writer, only make up a small percentage of the population. Because of this, I feel safe in saying that a new film parody of Austin, Love & Friendship, is likely only to be seen by folks who love and appreciate her stories. For them, this film is a must-see. For everyone else...not so much. Now this is not because there's anything wrong with this new movie...on the contrary, it's very well made and was produced, surprisingly enough, by Amazon Films (yes, from amazon.com)! Quite surprising...especially for a lush period piece. But the average person simply won't understand or appreciate the very droll and dry humor. And, even if you are a fan, you really have to be into the language and pay close attention for all the nuances. Again...not a complaint...more an observation which will let you decide whether the film will be right for you.This film, as in other Austin films, is set in the Regency period in Britain (the very early 19th century). However, the filmmakers actually chose to make the film in Ireland...and it's a nice substitute. When the film begins, Lady Susan Vernon (Kate Beckinsale) is abruptly leaving the Manwaring estate. You have no idea why but soon learn that Lady Susan is a rather poor woman and generally visits with friends and family in order to sponge off them. She also feels no particular obligation to pay her mounting debts...after all, she is Lady Susan! Her sister-in-law, Catherine Vernon (Emma Greenwell) isn't completely thrilled with the visit to her home, as Lady Susan has the reputation as a very beguiling yet vicious woman...all done with a smile. Catherine is also soon alarmed because her nice but slightly dim brother, Reginald DeCourcy (Xavier Samuel) is captivated by Lady Susan and would love to marry her. Oddly, despite Lady Susan being a horrible and conniving woman, when her daughter, Frederica (Morfydd Clark) joins them at their estate, she is nothing like her mother...and the audience hopes and prays that dopey Reginald recognizes Frederica and Susan for who they truly are. However, Susan is determined to have Reginald for herself and instead foist the incredibly boring and stupid Sir James Martin (Tom Bennett) onto Frederica. Can this master manipulator be stopped or will she soon manage to make three other people completely miserable?This film is quite funny but the humor is nothing like the long string of brain-dead and worthless parodies of films such as Disaster Movie and Date Movie. Instead of being broad and written for the average 10 year-old, Love & Friendship is often very subtle and is filled with wit that should appeal to Austin fans. But it's also the sort of well-crafted film that just has a limited appeal to broader audiences. It's a shame, as it's very well directed, sports a clever script and has lots of wonderful supporting actors such as Steven Fry and James Fleet (who is my favorite in the supporting cast). For fans of the author it's a must-see...others might just want to wait until this comes to Netflix or DVD.For fans, I'd give this one a 10. For all others, perhaps a 5 or 6.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjNjMzk5ZjUtNmIwZS00OGFmLWE5NGItZWY3Y2UyMTFkNDAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTU3NDU4MDg2._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

But like most purely improvised films, there's a rather low ratio of insights to the amount of screen time spent struggling to come up with something interesting.  (Actually, only one of the characters really manages to be interesting at all.)  Likewise, some of the shots of Mr. Badii driving around aimlessly have a certain Antonioniesque hypnotic effect, but most of them look no more interesting than random video you might have shot yourself in the industrial part of town.  There are critics who call this kind of untouched-by-art realism genius, who say that Kiarostami is making us think, reconsider the very nature of cinema, and so on.  To my mind, the message of the film-- the taste of cherry makes life worth living-- is no more or less profound than, say, Woody Allen rattling off a few of the things that make life worth living in Manhattan, or the epiphany the kid in American Beauty gets from a plastic bag.  (Likewise the message that it's all only a movie.  Never woulda guessed.)  And critics who find such a message shallow in a piece of slick entertainment, but deep when it's in a deliberately unentertaining art film, need to reexamine their critical principles, or lighten up a little-- or at least go see again the work of real art Kiarostami alludes to in his title, Wild Strawberries, which has more depth of characterization and emotional richness in any five minutes than this manages to scrounge up in an hour and a half.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg3Y2Q5YzMtMzNlYy00Y2MxLTkwYjctN2RhNDQ2NzczYWU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It delivers on everything it promises - beautiful, original creature effects, a real sense of menace, boobs, and a fantastic musical score - and blithely throws in a few extras, like well-developed, interesting characters, a wonderful surreality, beautiful visuals, and a legitimately new twist on a story as old as the hills. If there's any small criticism I have of this film, it's that a couple times there are characters that appear suddenly, do something, and then vanish, only to reappear later. There is no explanation of these characters, sometimes not even a name. I don't mind the lack to linear reality, but I did find myself asking questions about how these individuals fit into the greater story, and whether explanatory scenes had been cut. The only other not-positive thing I could say is that the dolphin noises are maybe a little silly. That's honestly it. I really really enjoyed this movie, and I'm so glad the Calgary Underground Film Festival showed it. It needs more publicity!In fact, I'm currently very frustrated because I can't find this movie or its soundtrack available anywhere. There's a song in the middle of the film that I'd love to listen to again, the 'Bloody Gloomy' song, and neither the clip nor the audio seem to exist online. Actually, I would love to watch the whole movie again; it's a very rich film, visually, with a lot of attention paid to little details like props and blocking and costumes. Especially as I was reading subtitles, I feel like I could gain a lot from a second viewing. I can only hope a North American distributor picks it up, as I would like to legitimately buy it and support Ms. Smoczynska. Good cinema deserves to be supported!Which brings me to my last point. This is actually my first review on IMDb, and I have to admit I'm leaving it partly out of frustration with the only other review for this film. If you don't like musicals, don't go see musicals! And if you see that a movie is classified as a musical, and you don't like musicals, and you go and see the musical anyway, PLEASE don't leave a negative review on the internet just because the MUSICAL that you CHOSE to see had MUSIC in it. That's like giving a horror movie a low score because it was scary! Come on now. You're discouraging people from going to see a perfectly good film because you don't like its genre, rather than any inherent flaw in the film itself. That's hardly fair. I hope people looking this movie up will give it a chance - it deserves much, much higher than a 3. I promise!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjhiMDcxM2EtNjllZi00YjJhLTg4MmEtMTg2ZjY2ZmViYjM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjYxMzY2NDk@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

When working in a shoe shop Diana gets met by two strippers who invite her down to try out for the Players Club where she gets taken on.  Given the name Diamond by her boss, Diana also gets her cousin involved in the club while she also tries to look after her son and stay in school.  Eventually the drama of the club gets intense and catches her up.I like Ice Cube as an actor.  He does stay in the `safe' comedy roles but he has also moved on well since his debut in Boyz n'da Hood.  Here he takes on his directorial debut and he does OK.  I mean the shots are nice and the camera moves around well enough.  Sadly he is let down on nearly every other front.  First off, the plot is pretty poor.  It's told in flashback and just seems to involve everyone swearing as our heroine tries to go her own way and move up and out etc etc.  We are `treated' to the odd dance and fight scene but really the bits don't all come together and it just feels like everyone is swearing over nothing all the time.The acting is surprisingly bad from several main sources.  Lisa Raye's narration is terrible but her performance is actually alright.  Calhoun is good looking and quite good but that's about it.  Mac is terrible, not funny or believable.  Foxx is not bad but could have done more.  Wilson and Givens are ugly and nasty ÃÂ they can't act and I find it hard to believe people actually paid Wilson to get naked!This film is basically a modern blackploitation film ÃÂ made for black people to come and watch regardless of quality.  The plot is average at best and the performances are mostly poor.  The plot is episodic and lacks drive or drama and will leave you feeling bored and distracted.  Overall Cube may have directing skills worth watching again but lets hope his next vehicle is better than this.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NDgwNzg4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg3NTU0NA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Someone else had put up a tent there and then abandoned it. As time passes by and the owners of the tent do not return, the newcomers start to suspect the worse. Then all hell breaks looseÃÂ If you are a horror fan like myself you'd know the premise of KILLING GROUND. It all had been done before. What makes this movie stand out is its extreme realism and ""no holds barred"" attitude. It is at times a hard, edge of the seat viewing, but a rewarding one in the end. KILLING GROUND shows how good a survival movie could be if it is well scripted, acted and doesn't try to cash in on cheap tricks.The story moves back and forwards, explaining bit by bit what happened to the first family and adding a sense of danger to the present. The villains are despicable, but down to earth real, which makes them even more terrifying. The performance of Aaron Glenane is particularly good. He gives us a small town psychopath, for whom murder is nothing but a daily routine. The film does not shy away from gore moments, but does not glorify them. The pictures our mind can draw are much scarier than what's on screen, and it's what makes KILLING GROUND tick. With all its tension KILLING GROUND is a pretty much conventional survival horror film, but there are so few good ones are out there. You may complain about its ""unoriginality"" but it is a horror movie you won't soon forget.QUICK FACTSDuring Q&A director Damien Power said that the inspiration for the film came to him as an image of an abandoned tent and a thought Ã¢ÂÂ what the worst could have happened with its owners?While shooting a film, Damien Power wanted a viewer to feel that ""the rule book of horror was thrown out of the window"" and that ""no one is safe"".KILLING GROUND will go on general release in 2017.(Please read my blog here:http://pashasfilms.blogspot.com.au)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzBmMjFjOWItYjE3Mi00YmQ3LTg3NzYtNDBjM2ZjNjhjYmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzExMTY0MjU@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Immediately, I was riveted by everything about it. I've always been a casual fan of The Band, and of Levon Helm in particular. However, I'd never been bowled over by Bob Dylan, except as a songwriter, so much of The Band's work remained unknown to me as well. I wouldn't say I've become a rabid fan, but I am much more interested in their work, now.It's a Scorsese film--how could it not be beautifully photographed, but Scorsese managed a difficult feat: he keeps himself out of the movie, except as interviewer during those sequences. This is not really Scorese's vision of a rock concert. It happened mostly organically, certainly with mistakes, gaffes and grit. This is part of its charm. There are better singers than the guys in The Band, but few better musicians. This can be illustrated with Robbie Robertson in the Clapton song: Clapton's guitar strap comes off and Robertson, with one beat, picks right up on the solo. It looked planned, but wasn't. Joni Mitchell was notoriously hard to back up, due to her original guitar tuning, and ragged song phrasing, but bassist Rick Danko fills in every space with intricate bass figuring. Perhaps we have become too accustomed to the overwrought, over-hyped, overproduced, overexposed, shiny gack that passes for popular music to appreciate the raw, the imperfect, the sheer humanness of this music. Scorsese shows it all. The guys in The Band were largely worn out and sometimes strung out in the interviews. They are tired, scrawny, empty-eyed from the excesses of the road. Rick Danko is hovering on the ragged edge, as his band is dissolved, and he says his goal is to ""keep busy."" Richard Manuel looks lost as he says ""I just want to break even."" These are two musicians who desperately needed the music, but who were murdered by the road. We see their bleak destinies in their eyes in this film. It is bittersweet certainly, but also a moment in time, crystallized into something great by the music, the love of friends, the willingness of the director to simply stand back and allow the music to happen. It also reminds us what good music used to sound like and makes me wish could exist again.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk2N2RkMGEtMGJjZS00OTk0LTk5NjgtNTg4ZjdiNDI2ZjE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The movie is 35 years old now but it is still the most intelligent and accurate portrayal of Artificial Intelligence ever put on film. In my opinion this is one of the best movies ever made, without a doubt it is the most underrated movie ever made. Be warned however this film will scare you; there is no blood or gore and the special effects are primitive by modern standards, but if The Forbin Project does not scare your brain then you have not understood it.This is one of the very rare occasions when the movie is better, much much better, than the book. When I read the book years ago I remember thinking the premise was great and with a few changes it could be really great, but as it is the book is mediocre at best. With genius you wouldn't expect B grade moviemakers to have they kept all the brilliant parts and eliminated all the stupid parts.

In the midst of a global crisis, they are called on once again to be the heroes the world needs.","70","A nice short trip back to my childhood","Like a lot of people, Power Rangers was the one show I couldn't miss after school. From the days of Rita and Zedd to the final battle that led to all the original villains like them as well as King Mondo and the Machine Empire, Divatox, Elgar, Astronema, Dark Specter and so many more being either destroyed or turned good due to Zordons great and ultimate sacrifice, this show seems corny some that didn't grow up watching it but to those that did, it's a time machine that I'm grateful to have. So when I heard about this movie and saw the trailer, I was ready to revisit a big piece of my childhood at least one more time.For me, Power Rangers Once and Always didn't disappoint for the most part. There was great nostalgic moments and I truly felt like I did as a child where I watched to see if Rita would finally succeed in some way as she executed her master plan to finally destroy the Power Rangers and conquer the galaxy like she first attempted to do back in 1993.The movie was shorter than I expected at a runtime of 58 minutes considering Power Rangers The Movie from 1995 was 1 hour and 30 minutes long and Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie from 1997 was 1 hour and 40 minutes. But I reminded myself that this is more of a reunion show so I treated it as a special double episode event. The plot and execution was really great to watch with some very interesting surprises and Easter eggs along the way for longtime fans. The acting at times was a bit shaky or corny but thats how it was even back then so this was one of the rare times that it still worked for me. The way they showed dedication and appreciation to the late and great original actors Thuy Trang (Trini) and Jason David Frank (Tommy) was very special to see to say the least. I don't want to ruin anything but I will say the scene right before the credits roll was absolutely perfect to honor them, the other original Rangers regardless if they were in this film or not and I felt it was also a nice little thank you to the fans that have watched from the beginning regardless if they've seen the first season in 1993 or recently.Power Rangers for me was one of the things that got me through some difficult times as I was in the hospital a lot due to receiving a Liver Transplant in 1989. Once in 1995 when I was in the hospital for tests, a family friend gave my Mom, Sister and I box seats to see Power Rangers Live in Toronto. I still have my ticket stub. It was an incredible experience I remember to this very day.I have had my transplant for 33 years (I'm 34) and one of the things that helped me escape the sounds of my IV, medical monitors and the hospital overall was watching Power Rangers when I could. Thats why even at the age of 33, the original seasons still mean so much to me today. I'm currently waiting for my 2nd transplant as this liver is slowing down, so this reunion was a reminder of what Power Rangers did for me during the tough and scary times. I'll always be grateful to everyone involved with the show and for the fans that helped keep it alive for those reasons and more. Thank you for this little trip down memory lane and I truly hope other longtime fans enjoy this as much as I did.My overall rating is 7/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTlmNzdiOWUtZmZiYi00ODkyLTk5ZGMtMTcwNzk1MmNjNjZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMTg2ODkz._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It keeps the Studio C standards for no swearing or lewd humor, and all violence is cartoon level, so take your super hero obsessed preschool and younger elementary-aged kiddos and scroll your phone in boredom while they laugh their heads off at things like an ""Evil Petco"" plan to take over the world or a robot bracelet that makes the wearers do silly dances on command.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE4ZTFmYmItYTk5ZS00YWFiLWI1M2MtNGM5OWYzMTkwZmU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI0MzA0NDE4._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I was not disappointed in any way, shape or form. There are a lot of negative reviews by people who don't understand the human brain. A sequel will NEVER be the same as the first time you experienced a great film. You already know the characters, general story, etc. and there is no room for surprises. What you can hope for is that the journey is continued and presented in a manner that entertains and stays true to the first film. My wife and I discussed the film afterward and we both agreed that there were components of ""The Second"" that were actually better than the first film. We got to know most of the characters better, we got to see Indian culture in much more depth and the story was much more involved than the first film.

Leslie Nielsen's films, literally, are jokes, and if you can't take them that way then maybe it would be better if you didn't watch them. I only say this here rather than just to that reviewer because I think it's worth pointing out that, in case you couldn't already tell, this movie is a parody and is meant to be laughed at. I am perfectly willing to admit that it is peppered with scenes that fall completely flat (the sex scene with the sports commentary in the background is a prime example) and much of Nielsen's acting is absolutely awful (also note that much of this is also a parody of similar bad acting in the movies that are being spoofed in this movie, such as The Fugitive and obviously some of the James Bond films), but again, you really need to keep in mind what kind of movie this is. Besides, there are also plenty of truly hilarious scenes. I can't help cracking up at the train peeking around the rock at Nielsen as he tries to escape, or the scene where he bends down to get his foot out of the railroad tracks and is hit in the forehead by the crossing gate. This scene was also screwed up, because that crossing gate was down across the track rather than a road going over the tracks, and it stopped rising just above Nielsen's head. But who cares? Comedy is a surprise, if you just saw what was expected it wouldn't be funny!I can't say that Wrongfully Accused promises a cerebral workout or any moving social commentary, but if you look at the cover of this movie and expect something like that, maybe you should stick to the kid's section at the video store, because you are probably a little out of your league. The rest of you should be able to find some things to laugh at in this movie.

And despite Sergio Leone, no one does them quite like Americans.Right at the top of my list of ten favorites westerns is Winchester 73. It was the first pairing and only black and white film of the partnership of director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. It was also a landmark film in which Stewart opted for a percentage of the profits instead of a straight salary from Universal. Many such deals followed for players, making them as rich as the moguls who employed them.Anthony Mann up to this point had done mostly B pictures, noir type stuff with no real budgets. Just before Winchester 73 Mann had done a fine western with Robert Taylor, Devil's Doorway, that never gets enough praise. I'm sure James Stewart must have seen it and decided Mann was the person he decided to partner with.In this film Mann also developed a mini stock company the way John Ford was legendary for. Besides Stewart others in the cast like Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan Duryea, John McIntire, Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson would appear in future Mann films.It's a simple plot, James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killing him. Why I won't say, but up to this point we had never seen such cold fury out of James Stewart on screen. Anthony Mann reached into Jimmy Stewart's soul and dragged out some demons all of us are afraid we have.The hate is aptly demonstrated in a great moment towards the beginning of the film. After Stewart and sidekick Millard Mitchell are disarmed by Wyatt Earp played by Will Geer because guns aren't carried in Earp's Dodge City. There's a shooting contest for a Winchester rifle in Dodge City and the betting favorite is Dutch Henry Brown, played with menace by Stephen McNally. Stewart, Mitchell and Geer go into the saloon and Stewart and McNally spot each other at the same instant and reach to draw for weapons that aren't there. Look at the closeups of Stewart and McNally, they say more than 10 pages of dialog.Another character Stewart runs into in the film is Waco Johnny Dean played by Dan Duryea who almost steals the film. This may have been Duryea's finest moment on screen. He's a psychopathic outlaw killer who's deadly as a left handed draw even though he sports two six guns. Another person Stewart meets is Shelley Winters who's fiancÃÂ© is goaded into a showdown by Duryea and killed. Her best scenes are with Duryea who's taken a fancy to her. She plays for time until she can safely get away from him. Guess who she ultimately winds up with?There are some wonderful performances in some small roles, there ain't a sour note in the cast. John McIntire as a shifty Indian trader, Jay C. Flippen as the grizzled army sergeant and Rock Hudson got his first real notice as a young Indian chief. Even John Alexander, best known as 'Theodore Roosevelt' in Arsenic and Old Lace has a brief, but impressive role as the owner of a trading post where both McNally and Stewart stop at different times.Mann and Stewart did eight films together, five of them westerns, and were ready to do a sixth western, Night Passage when they quarreled and Mann walked off the set. The end of a beautiful partnership that produced some quality films.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MDZlMDEtMzQxNi00NmY4LTg0NjItMjgyYzQxYjBhZWU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc5NjEzNA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It is rude, it is crude, and it is doggone hilarious. I can't really think of words to describe this film as none do so adequately. It is, of course, based upon the popular television show on MTV of the same name (except there's no ""the Movie"" on the end of it). Basically it is ""Candid Camera"" meets the X-Games meets drunkards. Its cast are a bunch of jackasses: Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Chris Pontius, Wee Man the Midget, Ryan Dunn, and Steve-O. They go around pulling various pranks, and sometimes - or most of the time - injuring themselves.The humor is very selective - some will hate it and others (mainly stoned teens) will love it. Take, for instance, a gag where one of the men walks into a plumbing store and relieves himself into a display toilet. Things such as this have been insinuated before on a commercial I remember for Best Buy, but this movie shows everything - in detail - including the feces inside the toilet bowl.Sound disgusting? Well it is. But some of the gags - for I can think of no other word to describe them - are just downright hilarious. For example, the co-creator of the TV series, Johnny Knoxville, borrows a car from a rental lot, takes it to a garage, has all the gears messed up and windows smashed, spray paints it, and then enters it into a car derby. He takes it back to the lot all smashed up and refuses to pay for the damage. He admits that he was drinking before it happened. He says they must help them pay for the damage to the vehicle. They point out that he signed a contract declaring that he would pay for all responsible damage, and he says, ""Yeah, but I had a little to drink when I signed that, too.""The cast and crew seem to have not grown past the age of 13 in terms of maturity. One of the best gags involves about four men on a golf course blasting air horns during tee-offs. One golfer gets so angered that he throws a golf club at them and starts to actually tee off at the men (who are hiding behind trees on the course).I've never quite witnessed something like ""Jackass the Movie"" before. It is like a giant unedited TV show stretched out to a full 80 + minutes, and let me say that this is the first time in history I have seen a TV-show-based film that I thought was too short. (Movies like ""Night at the Roxbury"" seem to go on forever.) ""Jackass the Movie"" is lots of fun - it isn't deep or intellectual, but it's fun. This film is definitely going to gross-out certain people, and enthuse the more wacky crowds out there. But it is one of the most ""technically"" entertaining films of the year. It isn't a masterpiece but it is very fun to watch. Maybe I'm an immature sicko, but I liked this movie.Before the film starts, there is a warning which reads something like ""the stunts performed herein are executed by trained professionals."" Let me ask: How does one train to be a jackass? This film doesn't tell us, but it sure does show us what trained jackasses are like. And you know what? Being a jackass looks fun.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTgwMmU0YzktOGNhNi00MDcyLTg1OGEtZGQwM2RlMTAyYzhlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The reason for this I believe is a lack of focused writing. Playing with the time and memory lapses of Byung-soo and how it relates to trying to catch his daughter's bf is a good idea and I think there are parts where it was very well executed. However there were also parts where it was badly executed and parts where the story becomes convoluted without any real reason. The audience attention is lost because of this lack of focus and instead you are left a bit confused about why certain scenes happened instead of gripped throughout. This confusion remains at the end of the film. Also the film commits the crime of continuing after the story ends, dragging on an extra 15 mins or so that could easily have been cut from the end. The concept is interesting and there's certainly parts where the story is engaging but it's not as well brought together as one would hope.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGY2MDkzMTctMjI3Mi00ODM0LWExNDktNGJlNDI2OGU2OTExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUxNTI3MzY@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Thomas thinks of Arnold as a hero, while Arnold's son Victor resents his father's alcoholism, violence and abandonment of his family.","123","Nothing short of miraculous.","Smoke Signals is a somewhat misunderstood film. The setting on an Indian reservation leads viewers to believe that Smoke Signals is about Indian issues or Indian philosophy. To be sure, the presence of Indian values and culture make this movie decidedly more enjoyable, but the movie is more transcendent, more universal than a purely Indian film. And, while this was heralded as the first movie to be written, directed and co-produced by Native Americans, there is something here for everyone, regardless of ethnicity.More than anything else, this movie appealed to me as a writer. Taken from Sherman Alexie's brilliant collection ""The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist Fight in Heaven"". it is beautifully written and expertly crafted from beginning to end. The first scene, narrated lyrically by Evan Adams as Thomas Builds-the-fire, sets the tone for a story handed down, as with Native American culture, in true oral tradition.The French title, Le secret des cendres (The secret of the ashes) more accurately describes the book and the movie, both of which must be experienced to fully appreciate Alexie's genius. With multiple allusions to fire and ash, each having different meanings, as well as a well integrated use of Native American lore, Smoke Signals requires more than a little thought for the average American viewer.The story revolves around two young Coeur d' Alene Indian men dealing with loss and the end of childhood innocence. The two men cope with loss in very different ways; Thomas though mysticism and legend, Victor through stoicism and denial. When Victor Joseph, brilliantly played by Adam Beach, learns that his estranged father has died, he and Thomas embark on a journey to claim the ashes, another allusion of the french title, and on the way get in touch with their identities as adults apart from their parents.Evan Adams is stupendous as Thomas Builds-the-fire. His storytelling scenes are pure magic. By imbuing simple memories with mystical reverence, he elevates them, and thus both himself and his listeners, to a new spiritual level. His exaltation of the ordinary is the core of this delightful work of genius. It culminates with a reading, slightly modified, of Dick Lourie's poem ""Forgiving Our Fathers"". Lourie, who is a self-described unreconstructed beatnik poet, brings a fragile and elegant beauty to the film's emotional climax. The final scenes, driven by Adams' narration and haunting Native American chant and music, are nothing short of miraculous.Adam Beach, strapping and stalwart as Victor Joseph, managed to parlay his appearance in Smoke Signals into a respectable film career. Evan Adams, diminutive and shy as Thomas Builds-the-fire, was not so lucky despite his masterful performance. Perhaps Admas' aspirations ran along different lines, as these days, even after starring in what is basically a sequel (The Business of Fancydancing, also by Alexie) Adams can now be called Dr. Adams, as he has become a respected and accomplished physician in British Columbia. The supporting cast was equally magnificent, and each lends credibility and energy to the movie. An interesting sidenote is that Irene Bedard, who appears as Suzy Song, was the physical model for Pocahontas in the Disney animated feature. I have seen this movie many times, and will undoubtedly watch it many more. Each time I am left in silent awe as I reflect on my own life, family, and philosophies.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MjU1NTg0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYwMDQ1MjE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The plot is a really simple story of a disappointed 40-something year old man, Kostis (Makis Papadimitriou, ""Chevalier""), who, while working as a doctor in Antiparos island, falls passionately in love with a young Anna (Elli Trigkou). The movie is set in the beautiful, yet crazy scenery of Antiparos, and it portrays its atmosphere and hedonistic frenzy in a vivid and realistic way. The drunkenness of summer and the liberal power of youth, as captured by the lens of Argyris Papadimitropoulos (""Wasted Youth""), are constantly being collated with the awkward phase of the middle aged body and the protagonist's useless struggle of overlooking it. The photography and visuals of the movie are stunning. Each frame is carefully set in a way that the characters inner selves are revealed through nature. The documentary-like feel of some of them serves as a catalyst in enclosing the atmosphere of the place through the unfolding of the plot. The body, and the ways we perceive it are also part of the plot, so be prepared for a lot of nudism and strong language. Makis Papadimitriou seems to be the best choice of portraying the disappointed, dissatisfied man who falls victim of his own passions. His performance is excellent, realistic and never over the top. Elli Trigkou is also convincing as Anna, and the rest of the cast seems to be carefully chosen. All in all, this movie is the vivid and painful hymn of the coming of middle age.

Even in the sleepy little village where I lived in England, every single boy of my age dreamed of being a ninja. The school playground was rampant with us wannabe assassins in duffel coats!In the aforementioned little village we only had one video shop, I spent weeks and weeks in a state of despair on Saturday afternoons, as we would go there only to see the dreaded ""Film on loan"" tab attached to the box.Eventually we finally turned up one afternoon and it was there...With no ""Film on loan"" tab on it! my life was finally complete and we took it home. My parents were never really into the whole ""film ratings exist for a reason"" thing. Incidentally, neither were the parents of pretty much all my friends, ahhh...The 80's, these young un's today don't know what they missed.Saturday evening finally came and American Ninja was inserted into the top-loader...As I sat eating my Vesta curry, My life literally changed in the following 90 minutes, I learned more than any teacher could ever show me at school, Joe was literally a god! This guy could do anything...Beat anyone! Most of my friends had already seen it and we were all finally on the same Ninja wavelength! We practiced Joe's moves, disappeared in a ""cloud of smoke"" (England gets a lot of fog in Autumn/ Winter) behind the school canteen, jumped over the tyres in the playground as part of our ""ninja training school"".Watching it back a couple of weeks ago (now I am 38) It is total crap, but total crap of the highest order. I thought ninja's were actually, you know, supposed to be elite assassins. Here the baddie Ninjas seem to get away with being pretty mediocre to be fair, they miss the easiest targets, get knocked out by really bad punches and kicks, do lots of unnecessary front and back flips, and generally don't really perform very well.

The acting is so good it's hard to call it acting. Mads Mikkelsen (Jacob) puts up a terrific performance with acting that is as credible as it is subtle. Not the over-the-top stuff that we are familiar with from Hollywood, but acting that actually makes you think ""yes, this is how real flesh and blood people would react"". I was also pleasantly surprised by Sidse Babett Knudsen (Helene). She has a lot of scenes with little or no dialog, but the way she tells everything with subtle face expression is simply mind blowing. And let's not forget Rolf LassgÃÂ¥rd (JÃÂ¶rgen) and Stine Fisher Christensen (Anne), who both remind us what real flesh and blood emotions look like in a way that really hits you in the face.Anyway, I'm a fan of Scandinavian films for reasons mentioned above, and I'm almost ashamed to say that in that light this film was really nothing new, and luckily so: just more of the same wonderful stuff! What really stuck with me about this film however is the story. It is so ...human in all aspects. I won't reveal any spoilers, but as the story unfolds, it just gets so much more complex than you expect at first. In the first 15 minutes, I expected the movie was mainly going to be about the struggle between JÃÂ¶rgen and Jacob. The struggle between these two ""stereotypes"" really... one being the cool business man who solves everything with money, and the other being the idealistic but clumsy social worker. I was pleasantly surprised however that it got even better after that. What I mainly like about the movie, is that it doesn't offer any simple solutions. In the end, there are no perfect happy endings that solve every puzzle; the main characters have to make decisions, but it's not all black and white like we see in a lot of other movies. People have to do things they might not have done initially, but in the end, there may be upsides as well. You know... that sounds an awful lot like real life, and that's a good thing for a film if you ask me.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGI1NzBhZGEtNzM0OC00MjI1LTlkYzUtZjM0N2ExNmY3M2JhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTU3NDU4MDg2._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's the story of an immigrant who is infected with the pneuomic plague (but ""bubonic,"" as listed on the back of the VHS cover) and the race to discover all the people he had come in contact with, including a criminal (Jack Palance) and his gang.The great black-and-white cinematography helps put it in the film-noir category, I imagine, but the story still takes precedence over the stark photography here. The angular-faced Palance, listed as ""Walter Jack Palance"" in here, always makes for a good villain and Zero Mostel was an interesting part of his group.Richard Widmark played an normal intense role, except this time as a good guy, and Barbara Bel Geddes was her normal wholesome character. Despite third billing, she didn't have as many lines as I would have preferred to hear. Frankly, I prefer Widmark as the crazy-type villain. He spends much of the time in this film as a frustrated doctor, yelling at the cop Paul Douglas. That gets tiresome after awhile.It's a grim story: not a whole lot of laughs here, but it's entertaining and moves fast......and the ending chase scene is a knockout!

Rosman makes the most of the filming locations while nicely adding stylistic touches to the film with good camera work and some nice imagery. He creates some truly effective moments of psychological horror, as well as physical (with some occasional bloody moments).

But for pure entertainment value this is the quintessential Duke.Cecil B. DeMille was of the opinion that motion pictures have to move. He wouldn't have anything to complain about The Comancheros on that score. There's not a dull moment in the film. This was the last directorial effort of Michael Curtiz and he kept the action flowing.Three things stand out in The Comancheros. First Elmer Bernstein's music keeps the action going. You will be humming that theme days after viewing this film. Secondly the Cinemascope photography is breathtaking even viewing a formatted VHS copy. I remember seeing The Comancheros in the Sheepshead Bay Movie Theatre in Brooklyn as a lad and a theater is where this film should really be viewed.But mostly since the two of them are on the screen together for about half the film, the chemistry with John Wayne as Texas Ranger Jake Cutter and Stuart Whitman as fugitive Paul Regret is what sets the whole tone of the film. Wayne and Whitman only worked one other time together and that was in The Longest Day. They were such a perfect fit it's a pity they didn't do more together.This was also the first time the Duke worked with Lee Marvin. Marvin's character is only on screen for about 10 minutes, but you remember him throughout. This is also the final screen appearance of Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams who must have done at least fifteen films with Michael Curtiz back in the heyday of Warner Brothers.The Comancheros deserves an honored place in the performances of John Wayne and can't be beat for entertainment.

Has Somebody Come To Town.""","One of the best of John Wayne's westerns is Tall In The Saddle which came out in 1944 for RKO. Good characterization with a little more plot than the usual western.Wayne is the straight arrow Joel McCrea-Gary Cooper like hero who's come to town because he's been sent for by Red Cardell, a local rancher who's concerned about an outbreaking of cattle rustling. When Wayne arrives he finds Cardell murdered and a few others occur before the truth comes out. Wayne has two leading ladies, prim and proper easterner Audrey Long and hard riding Ella Raines. Raines in those tight cowboy outfits is something to see. Her scenes with the Duke have some real spark to them. Raines had a Lauren Bacall-like appeal and should have risen higher as a movie sex symbol.Old friends of the Duke like Ward Bond and Paul Fix are in the cast as is Gabby Hayes. Hayes, who was the quintessential cowboy sidekick was never better than as Dave, the old stagedriver who befriends the Duke and sticks with him when it gets pretty dark for him. I remember Gabby Hayes with his television show for kiddies in the 1950s and supposedly he was anything but the illiterate old coot he normally played. During his pre-Stagecoach period, Hayes appeared in several films with Wayne. In fact my title quote is one of two favorite lines he says in Tall In The Saddle.The other favorite line is a piece of wisdom that's just as valuable today as in 1944. When the Duke asks Gabby how he feels about law and order, Gabby replies ""depends on who's dishing it out.""","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDM2MWQyOTMtY2UzZS00NTliLTk2ZDctMjI3ZWZjMjgxNzczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's great!A post apocalyptic movie made by Spain and Bulgaria, it shows an insurance agent (the only people who actually do any motivated detective work :) ) trying to find out what is going on with robots behaving strangely. Two laws are restricting said robots from harming people and from altering any robots and it appears someone has found away around these hardcoded rules.The film reminded me of Blade Runner, obviously, but it went a slightly different direction, more akin to Sector 9. The gruesomeness of the dirty city and the violent slums outside it is clear and uncompromising - think Brazil meets Cidade de Deus. The acting is good, slightly overemotional in the case of Antonio Banderas - but he is Spanish, so we understand, and completely balanced by the coolness of the Blue Robot (Javier Bardem, lol). I couldn't really find a problem with the direction and the script was great!So, bottom line: a wonderful film. It shows that it is not the highest budget movie in the world, but it more than compensates through story, details, acting and even casting. I thought McDermott's character was a very good one to explain the overall attitude of humans towards robots and it felt like they could have added some more to it.

The bank robbery angle is an intriguing place to start the story and the banality of the workplace provides some moments of amusement and intrigue.However the director soon gets bored with the central premise of the story and gets distracted by meandering through a variety of inconsequential subplots. These subplots end up contributing little to the film's plot overall. By the end it was really making me angry at how slow the plot was and how little the director cared about my time.I have rarely been so bored during a film, honestly would have walked out if I hadn't been with a bunch of people who wanted to stay.I'd ignore the inexplicably positive reviews by the high and mighty artsy film critics, save three hours and skip this one.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ3YjFmNjYtNWFjZS00M2Y1LThjOTktNmRjZTIyMmUxMTc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjgxODk1MTM@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

That's just me. I found it weird watching him smoke up on the couch watching cartoons.It was amusing for the first while, but it ended with a 'what the hell did I just watch' feeling.They introduced mental illness into the story line, a reason for Zach being nuts, and they solved it basically by getting him to shave his beard off.

The obvious break-up follows; she needs more passion and different sexual experiences. As sad as it seems; these five opening minutes of the movie are the smartest, funny moments I saw in a movie this side of the Atlantic. There are no stupid or dumb or scatological jokes involved; simple a few utterly realistic but absurd moments and dialogs.Jordan is not a dumb or clumsy person (well it has a few moments). He is an accountant with all the insecurities, limitations, fears and lack of commitment of a person living by the numbers. He needs Rachel to be with him; sex is not that important.He has to go, on his planned vacation to Toronto, alone (the scene at the airport is another masterpiece) to visit his pal Dandak (Vik Sahay always funny) who offers to be his sexual mentor against Jordan will.After a few comical situations; Jordan ends in an strip club trying to get a sexy photo with a beautiful girl to make Rachel (who is having a very sexual and orgiastic vacation) jealous. By Karma, meets Julia (Emily Hampshire) a stripper, sweet but very disorganized; totally against checking even her bills; basically his opposite.He soon realizes that without loosing up; his future with Rachel is dead; he ask Julia for a crash course on freedom, taboos and sex. What follows are the different chapters of Jordan education process.It is pretty obvious how things will end; but every chapter that follows is staged with intelligence and good taste; but do not even think the movie is tame; it just has good taste. There is plenty of nudity male and female but never out of context. In fact, one of the funniest scenes in the movie it is likely to be too much for MPAA but it will be a real sin to cut.Acting is superb; Jonas Chernick (also producer and writer) is a seriously funny person; he improves after his experiences but is still the same person a little more confident. Sarah Manninen handles the bitch girlfriend character with class. She just an insecure person that is never sure what she really wants. Emily Hampshire as the stripper, is able to be tender but strong; enough to fall in love with her. I hope this movie gets distribution in USA and UNCUT. It is really a surprise that a not so original story could be handled with such an intelligent way.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MTYzOTMyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwNDYzOQ@@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Well, a movie about decadent Nazis is bound to be a little hysterical -- what, were you expecting something tasteful?  Hysteria is probably the best mode with which to treat the Third Reich.  What's astounding is that director Luchino Visconti forced his sweaty, hysterical visuals into a rigid classical structure.  The set-up is pure clockwork: one betrayal leading to another; one devastation opening up an even deeper abyss for another perpetrator.Basically, Visconti is taking on  *Macbeth*, here.  Dirk Bogarde plays the Macbeth figure, an up-and-coming industrialist who's sleeping with an evil Grande Dame of Nazi finance, Sophie von Essenbeck  (Ingrid Thulin, having an absolute ball), heiress to a munitions conglomerate.  (The von Essenbecks are loosely based on the Krupps, but don't take this as any sort of literal historiography.)  Thulin eggs on her lover Bogarde to commit a few politic murders and a frame-up or two so that he can take over the family business, with herself as the power behind the throne.  But she doesn't count on the pathology of her grown son from a previous marriage, the hideous little monster Martin  (Helmut Berger, acting terribly but it sort of fits in an Udo Kier-sort of way).  Martin is your typical Nazi:  a closet pedophile, a drug addict, a transvestite, a momma's-boy, a you-name-it.  The scenes involving his seduction of a 9- or 10-year-old girl who lives in a shabby apartment complex are some of the most disturbing that you'll ever see in cinema . . . and along those lines, I seriously wonder about the state of mind of some of the commentators here who find this movie to be high camp, to be watched with drinking buddies.  If you think molestation is funny, you'd better see a shrink, pal.    Anyway.  The plot is so Byzantine that it finally defeats a brief summary. Let it suffice to say that Visconti manages to cram his complicated story neatly within the historical context of the period between the Reichstag Fire and the Night of the Long Knives, thereby maintaining a nutty observance of Classical Unities.  All the while, he films the thing in Hammer-horror Pop color, with intense contrast between shadow and light. The first scene, by the way, is a shot of the blasting furnaces of the munitions factory -- a fitting intro to the horrendous vision of depravity which soon follows.  Everyone's sweating in this movie:  drops of perspiration trickle down temples, and beads of sweat glisten on upper lips throughout, as if the flames of Hell are licking up at the soles of their collective feet.  *The Damned*  is a feverish masterpiece.  You'll never forget it.  Highest recommendation.(A tip for viewing of the DVD:  I recommend that you watch the movie with the English subtitles ON.  While everyone speaks English in the film, only Bogarde is clearly intelligible.  Owing to the complicated plot, you'll need to know what's going on in order to fully appreciate Visconti's thematic design.)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJlMTg0N2QtNTYxYi00ZWRiLWE0ODgtYmE1Nzk3OTNkM2E2L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Tina Fey as Portia and Paul Rudd as John turn in pleasant performances as an admissions executive and a progressive school teacher respectively. Rudd is amiable here and usually successful in his film career, while Fey's efforts up to now have been mediocre (Date Night, Baby Mama).As an Alumni Admissions interviewer for over 30 years at Georgetown University, I find much of the story ringing true from the overachieving candidates nurtured by ambitious parents to the underachieving but brilliant and risky individualists. Portia must struggle with the boxed-in role of continuing the Princeton tradition (read stereotypes) or breaking away to push for a student who calls himself an ""autodidact"" with low grades but perfect scores on achievement tests for courses he never took.Amid the plot's fierce applicant battle for a slot, Portia and John dance to the usual romantic formula of disliking each other to . . . Well, you know the drill. However, it's their reactions to the admission process that provide the authentic tension as he has developed students with independent minds, and she is used to the cookie-cutter candidates who lack the passion of those independents.Director Paul Weitz knows something about family dynamics and children with his About a Boy, In Good Company, and Little Fockers among the more obvious examples. Signing up Lily Tomlin to play Portia's feminist mom was inspired; like the ubiquitous aging Alan Arkin, Tomlin should now have plenty of work.Admission requires no small amount of sympathy for the messy business of growing up and getting aheadÃ¢ÂÂWeitz navigates the vagaries of family ambition well. If the double-meaning of the title seems too precious to you, don't worry, the rest of the story is almost unambiguous.Although Admission is mostly about applicants to an upper-tier college, it also poses the unethical means some might employ to gain entrance. Even Portia is not blameless, a touch I found in the film's favor while it deals with the unreal segment of our population smart enough to be considered for admission.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE2OTkwNzg5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY0NzQ3OA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This is the worst excuse for an adaptation of a novel I have ever seen.  Nothing is explained about Siddalee, Shep, Vivi, the Ya-Yas, the younger siblings, Buggy, etc.  No one will understand fully the anguish that the children went through as children or the anguish that Vivi went through in her own childhood.  Shortcuts were taken left and right in this film, much to the detriment of the storyline.  For instance, Shep is not a living saint, Vivi did not simply beat her children because of dexamyl, Teensy's mother is barely mentioned, Vivi's stay at the boarding school was left out, and where is Aunt Jezie, grownup Lulu, Little Shep, and Baylor?  I realize that it was a two hour film, but an adaptation should never have been attempted if it wasn't going to be done faithfully. Everything in this film was explained away too easily.  Sidda needed much more than a sob story about her mother's loss and use of dexamyl to explain her behavior.  Too easy, too simple, too cheesy.  No one could possibly come away with a clear understanding and resolution of the plot.

The story of a boy, a girl, and a computer trying to find the meaning of love could have easily been a ridiculously campy movie, but instead is played out with a lighthearted sincerity.  Lenny Von Dolen's portrayal of architect Miles Harding is done well, conveying the feelings of insecurity and wonder of falling in love for the first time, and Virginia Madsen's performance as would-be girlfriend Madeline equally shines.  The movie is shot more like a music video (Director Steve Barron also worked on Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean"" video), and while there have been plenty of films that have used similar ""MTV-style"" techniques in the '90's, this was an unpioneered format at the time, and it seems to work the best here. The set design is great, the scene pacing doesn't drag on, and the sentiment is in the right place so that viewers can laugh at the humorous parts and relate during the romantic scenes.  The music soundtrack is also top-notch, with music from Culture Club, Jeff Lynne, Heaven 17 and Giorgio Moroder. The computer technology and the commercials set this movie firmly in the early '80's, which may make it seem a little dated, but the overall story still holds up well and is fun.  Electric Dreams is an enjoyable romantic fantasy that a lot of people may have missed when it was first released (even more so since the film seems to be out of print), but for those wanting to see something a little different, this may be what you've been looking for.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjk4NjBmYTQtZWE2Mi00MDRjLTlmNzctOWRkMjkzMGFlYmU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMwMjk0MTQ@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

By that I don't mean it's about babies and relationships, a common misconception of 'female viewpoint', but rather it's the experience of a male world from outside.  In this film the men are the sex objects, and the aggression is female aggression.  In fact one of the things this film studies is the different reactions the heroine experiences with regard to her actions just because she is female, cop or no, and is expected to act in specific ways.  I think one of the reasons it is consistently overlooked is that male reviewers just don't get it and those who do don't like it.  They don't like the way everything is turned upside down.  Curtis isn't nurturing, she's not a victim, she doesn't fear her abusive father, she's attracted to a violent man but is equally callous about him when she realises what he is, she doesn't break down and try to change him, reform him, or marry him.

After the first Hollywood movie The Fugitive(lead actor Harrison Ford) was admitted in my country, the Chinese films changed forever by the affections of Hollywood movies. But the Chinese film makers did not know how to tell a story in the Hollywood way. Especially the film makers wanted to make BIG movie (the movie making cost high) to gain the high profit in the market, but in the same time they seemed like they forget how to tell a good story. But Chinese audience is very tolerable, they watch they comment and they despise. After all these years' BIG films' bombing, I watched a good story telling film, why should I not be satisfied?Disscusing this film in the technique way is not the important thing. All this years the BIG films all packed by the advanced techniques, but inside is a garbage.(sorry for the rude word, I can not say a better word for my poor English)Somebody (maybe a lot of foreign people) may want to watch more KongFu in Chinese films. But what I want to say is KongFu is not the only part of Chinese Culture, in fact it never was the major part of Chinese Culture in the past three thousand years. I can say it because I know our country and her history. The relationship and interaction of characters is the major part of film . This film is based on a novel Thunder Storm by Chao Yu in 40s of 20th century, and the background is changed to about 9th century.For the solid story by Chao Yu, the film is brilliant. And the success of this film is also a victory of Chinese writers. It proved that the real good novel can live all the time.Thank you for read this.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA3NTY2MjA0NzFeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDgwNTA3NDE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's quick and efficient, it does its job well, but it's not something you're going to think much about ten minutes after you see it (now, now, don't get greedy). Why do I like it? Fox. And I don't consider myself a big Michael J. Fox fan, I mean, he was good in Family Ties, but that was a long time ago and he's done some stinkers between then and now. Maybe because the smooth talker consierge he plays in this reminds me a little of Alex P. Keating back in the day. This guy is super-slick, his mind is always going at incredible speeds. One part that will always stand out is the 'ticket trade' scene (How'd this Donahue get in here?). Funny stuff. There are a few good laughs in here.Oops, can't forget Gabrielle Anwar.

The marriage did not last, but fortunately this film did--and I say fortunately, for although it is somewhat forgotten today, DEAD AGAIN is an overlooked jewel of a film: classy, noir-ish, stylish, and very memorable indeed.The story is fanciful. In the late 1940s noted composer Roman Strauss was convicted of murdering his noted pianist wife Margaret, and was sentenced to death. Some forty years later, a young woman suffering from amnesia falls into the hands of a no-nonsense Los Angeles private eye--and under hypnosis she recalls not her immediate past, but the lives of Roman and Margaret. Is this reincarnation? Is she Margaret Strauss? Is the private eye to whom she is attracted but of whom she is also strangely fearful the reincarnation of Roman Strauss, Margaret's killer? Is history repeating itself? Scott Frank's clever script makes for a fast-paced, twisting, and fascinating plot-driven film--and it is flawlessly played by Branagh and Thompson, who assume dual roles as the 1940s Roman and Margaret Strauss and the 1980s Mike Church and Grace. The supporting cast is also excellent, with memorable performances by Andy Garcia and Derek Jacobi--and a truly exceptional cameo by Robin Williams, who here for the first time demonstrated that his talents went far beyond comedy. The shifts between past and present, nightmare and reality are exceedingly well done, and although the plot becomes more and more fantastic the entire film is so perfectly executed that one buys into it every step of the way.If DEAD AGAIN has a flaw, it is that some of the twists and turns are predictable--but in the film's favor I must admit that it sweeps you along so quickly that you seldom have time to analyze that failing while you actually watch the film. It is also to a certain extent a ""one trick pony"" film; the film is at its most powerful upon a first viewing, when one is oblivious to what is coming. But even so, it is tremendously effective and it holds up as well today as when it first appeared on the big screen. The current DVD includes little in the way of extras beyond commentary tracks by producer Lindsay Doran, writer Scott Frank, and director-star Kenneth Branagh--and these are as hit-and-miss as commentary tracks usually are, but they hit more often than miss. The picture and sound quality is overall very good. Recommended!Gary F.

The animation, whilst heavily stylised and nowhere near as crisp as todays fare, works perfectly with the material. Compare the 2000 sequel, 'Bloodlust': the animation in the latter is incredibly slick and the action comes thick and fast, but it might as well be robots fighting in outer space or samurai battling on a mountaintop. What the original does, with its dirty, old fashioned animation is create a decidedly other-worldly and eerie feel, perfectly encapsulated in the strange, mutated beings that roam the hostile countryside, glowing and sidling in a sinister fashion. The overall colour scheme, as well, is very Dario Argento: dark blues and browns prevail over the modern, Akira and Ghost in the Shell inspired trend for green overkill. Character design is, as said, very stylised, but perfectly acceptable, and D himself looks as cool as all hell.As for the plot, there are no problems there, although there are a few clichÃÂ© moments. The counts boredom, as opposed to the angst that seems to be all the rage in vampire flicks nowadays, is a nice touch, and at no point do characters motives seem unbelievable. The setting is a nicely realised far future post-apocalyptic landscape full of the standard juxtapositions (horse riders with laser rifles) bought to life by the supernatural element, which seems to have taken monsters and critters from anywhere and everywhere, to no detriment. The voice acting is competent, much better than some eighties dubs I could mention (unfortunately I only have this film on VHS, so I can't compare to the original Japanese).Overall, not the best of 80's anime. It lacks the sophistication of Akira or the sheer camp hyperviolence of Fist of the North Star, but it's still a very enjoyable film, and a solid part of the collection of any anime connoisseur.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGJmZmVlOTAtZmQyMS00NmUzLWJmZDUtZjM3M2MwMDdhZmQyL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzM4MjM0Nzg@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

They were probably baffled and tried figuring out which country had the flying cars and 2D world after seeing the Jetson's cartoon. Anyway, enough ranting about people who can't grasp the depth. The acting wasn't bad at all I found. Of course Elijah acts different, which I see not everybody likes, but you need to respect the fact he's an actor. We all got to know him as ""the guy from Lord of the Rings"". Well, newsflash, in his defense he won't be acting the same way in this ""smart"" movie as he did fighting off monsters with a smaller vocabulary. He plays an intelligent role this time around. I can't say I know of 'anybody' who could figure out what happens in the end.

One fateful night, Talbot escorts her to a local carnival where they meet a mysterious gypsy fortune teller.","181","Lon Chaney Jr's signature role is still one of his best performances. 'The Wolf Man' is an undisputed horror classic.","Lon Chaney Jr lived under the shadow of his famous father, but in 'The Wolf Man' he helped create a horror icon that has lasted for over sixty years. Chaney had already shown that he could act in 'Of Mice And Men'(1939). In 'The Wolf Man' he gives another excellent performance, but this movie was both a blessing and a curse to his career I think. It forever labeled him a horror actor, and frankly he made a lot of lousy movies after this. Some good ones too, don't get me wrong, but too often he was given b-grade material to work with. Maybe his drinking problem had a lot to do with it, I don't know, but apart from a strong cameo in 'The Defiant Ones'(1958) and a great performance in Jack Hill's cult classic 'Spider Baby'(1964), he rarely was given a role as good as Larry Talbot in this movie. Chaney is surrounded by a very strong supporting cast including horror legends Claude Rains ('The Invisible Man') and Bela Lugosi (sadly only a cameo), Ralph Bellamy ('His Girl Friday'), and frequent costar Evelyn Ankers (she and Chaney made a great on screen couple but apparently hated each other off screen. Such is Hollywood!). Many people complain about the casting of Rains and Chaney as father and son. I agree it's totally unrealistic, but I don't think it hurts the movie at all. The lack of Lugosi is a bigger problem. There was more footage of him but unfortunately it wasn't used in the final cut. It's too bad as more scenes between Lugosi and Chaney would have been a treat. Of course they worked together a few times after this, but mostly in lesser movies. The real scene stealer in 'The Wolf Man' is Maria Ouspenskaya who plays the gypsy woman Maleva. She's just terrific, and gives the most memorable performance after Chaney. 'The Wolf Man' has had an enormous influence on just about every subsequent werewolf movie. Much of the lore seen on screen here isn't in fact traditional, as many people assume, but created by the talented Curt Siodmak ('Donovan's Brain') who subsequently wrote the horror classics 'I Walked With A Zombie'(1943), and 'The Beast With Five Fingers'(1946). 'The Wolf Man' is an undisputed horror classic, and just as entertaining and interesting as it ever was.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODRmMDBjMTYtZmJiZi00Mzk3LWFhZDAtMDExNDFhMWQzNzEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDY2MTk1ODk@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Tom was my roommate at Oklahoma A&M (now OK State U). I have discussed the film with Tom and read official State Police reports of the information on which the story dwells. The first few minutes when Robert Redford goes into the prison incognito was a device to inform the audience of conditions. The remainder of the film is factual, although embellished at points for audience interest. Redford did an outstanding performance representing Murton. At times I could almost believe that it was Murton standing there! Murton was advised by Governor Rockefeller that he had 48 hours to leave Arkansas or be charged with grave robbing. Official reason: lack of qualifications. How much does it take to qualify? Murton got a BS in Agriculture at A&M, and a Dr of Criminology at U Cal, Berkeley, was a Dept Marshal and had 20 years experience in corrections. Murton kept his sense of humor, keeping count of applications declined (he was ""too controversial"") for similar work (43 at last count), and remarked that one day another system would be so corrupt to demand his services. He died after teaching at Southern Illinois, U of Hawaii, and even his alma mater in Oklahoma. Waste of talent of a brilliant penologist.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzViZjU1ZjUtYjVmMi00ZWE2LWFiNGItOGJkOTliZmFhYWU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Unfortunately the answer is not that flattering to these beautiful, intelligent women.Decent performances from the two lead actors, Gustaf Skarsgaard and Anna Astrom. Astrom is incredibly beautiful.Sadly the soundtrack does not include Pearl Jam's ""Better Man"" and Joe Jackson's ""Is she really going out with him?"" as these would have been highly appropriate.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MTE0NjM2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE3NDkzOQ@@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Too many ingredients won't make a good stew","Saw this at the Film Fest Ghent 2014, expecting something remarkable or novel, given what Cannes jury had to say about it. Alas, for me it failed on several counts, mainly because I don't think that throwing in an ample variety of ingredients does produce a good stew. It seems that the film makers tried to follow a complicated recipe, but could not come to a consistent and balanced product. The best example of something completely out of tune was the bee produced by Gelsomina out of her mouth on two occasions, the last one as part of the TV show she signed up her family for. It should be possible to find something better for this purpose, and still having a relationship with their bee keeping business where it was all about.The synopsis on the festival website stated that Gelsomina was the center of the bee keeping business, and particularly the honey extraction process, but I found that not so clearly shown while watching the movie. Yet she is mentioned several times as ""head of the family"", while all signs seem to point in different directions. Also, when the boy Martin is introduced, everyone points to Gelsomina as the responsible person, and again I don't understand as it is the father who introduced the boy in the first place. I apparently did miss something important.An annoying aspect of this movie is that it happened a few times that the scenery jumped to several hours later in time, without being clear about the change. For example: after the day that the boy was lost on the island, we suddenly see Gelsomina in action on the farm, requiring us to take some time noticing we are at a different time and place now, and adjust our focus accordingly. It happened to me several times, but this was the most prominent occurrence that I still remember.While this film's Grand Prize of the Cannes jury rises expectations, I'm disappointed because of my overall feelings that the end product is not in any way remarkable, all things considered. It happened many times before that I didn't agree with festival juries, however, so this may become a fact of (my) life. It may be so that the jury admired the portraying of life on a farm, being a non-issue for me grown up on a farm myself. So all the tedious tasks and the inherent dangers in animals and machinery were merely deja-vu for me, nothing out of the ordinary. Similarly, the mixed household and the assortment of very different people having to work together, is normal on a farm and standard operating procedure. In other words, I'm prejudiced in duplicate, on one hand to find something that the Cannes jury found remarkable, on the other hand seeing a portrait of farming that offers nothing special for me. I'm inclined to forget about the jury and let aforementioned faults weigh in to arrive at a negative conclusion.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5NDk1OTk3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODk3ODU3NjE@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The first film, ""Dynamite Hands"" is a black and white ""Golden Boy""-type spoof with Harry Hamlin as a young boxer rising to the top with George C. Scott as his manager, Red Buttons as his trainer, Kathleen Beller as his hometown girlfriend and Ann Reinking as a nightclub singer named Troubles Moran. The second film is called ""Baxter's Beauties of 1933"" and is a colorful spoof of films like 42nd STREET with George C. Scott featured again as the egomaniacal director, Barry Bostwick as the idealistic young songwriter, Rebecca York (who years later would practically steal the Broadway show VICTOR/VICTORIA from Julie Andrews) as the young Ruby Keeler type and Trish VanDevere as the bitchy diva who York eventually replaces.

The North American premiere had a sold out seating of intrigued moviegoers. Some liked it including myself and my Japanese-Canadian friend who speaks fluent Japanese and other utterly disliked this bizarre piece of cinema. Understandably, this is not for everybody and is definitely in the sexually charged vein of Strange Circus (2005) and Guilty Romance (2011) realm rather than palatable post-apocalyptic dramas like Himizu (2011) or Land of Hope (2012).Sono is an artist and has one the most disparate notions of time for his movies with his two best, Cold Fish (2010) and Noriko's Dinner Table (2005), clocking around 150-160 mins, but Love Exposure (2008) rambling on at 240 mins, while Tag (2015) ticked by in 85 mins. The Whispering Star (2015) is only 100 mins but feels like years with sparse dialogue and landscapes, long slow takes and black & white interplanetary postal robot mood. Anti- Porno is his shortest here at 78 mins but packs a lot of tricks in a tight vision of lust and lost.The movie starts with cute clichÃÂ©s and colourful art direction concerning sex and seduction in an S&M and bisexual tension kind of way. Add a toilet, a toy, other girls as audience / participants, a taunt and a twist! Ami Tomite who also started in Sono's Tag (2015) and The Virgin Psychics (2015) plays the lead and seductress self-proclaimed whore. She is a superstar and has her assistant prepare her packed daily schedule, including a photo-shoot, but verbal abuse, nudity, submission, sex, slicing of wrists and depravity ensue. Take a photo-shoot and video of all thisÃÂThen comes the role reversal and question of identity. Who is shooting who and playing who? Who is directing? Who is writing? Who is shooting a sex scene in the woods or in a room? Who is a whore and a virgin? How to emancipate ourselves? What is sex and what does it say about society and individuals?This film raises many questions, is a welcome criticism of sex as a taboo and explores Japanese sexual repression and oppression specifically, but touches on worldly and beautiful themes with a mature, daring tone. The conversation of teenage girls and their parents at dinner table is priceless and unheard of. A necessary discussion of equals that makes you think while shocking your preconceived ideas about sex and parenting, even if you are a liberal!Thank you Sono for again pushing the boundaries.Lots of beauty and thoughts in this seemingly absurd and self- absorbed subtle sexual and mental exploration.Japan 2016| 78 min | Festival du Nouveau Cinema | Japanese (English subtitles)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWU5YmMwMDktNzJkZi00NWRiLWFmYTYtODY4MjIyN2ZlYjA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MTM5NjI2._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The movie has not been released yet so the chances that the people who are bombarding the movie with 1 star reviews were in Cannes or in another of a handful of festivals that it was screened and they really hated this film are very slim. I'm not sure what's the agenda behind this attempt for defamation of the film but my guess would be that they come from people who would like Farhadi to be more vocal and criticize more the Iranian state. But Farhadi let's his films speak for their own.And what a powerful voice they have indeed. From a technical point the film is excellent as someone should expect from him at this point. The acting is excellent, the photography purposeful but in a good way, and the rhythm is great. As for the script is really a masterclass, that people who like cinema I'm pretty sure they're gonna appreciate.Don't fool yourself, this film may be subtle but it is deeply political. It's just that most good films don't have to rub their morality or political opinion in your face. Don't get me wrong, it is not a very morally or politically complicated film. In fact as the director himself said in a recorded message for the festival this film is about a very simple man. But the way he treats his characters is not simple in the mean that they are not exaggerated in order to form archetypes, and therefore they seem rather human that certainly adds a very realistic element to the film. That's the reason I found it to be a very heavy film in a way.All in all, I think it's an excellent film who is going to age pretty well and I expect as soon as it is released the rating to skyrocket pretty fast.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRlNzkyYzUtYzE5Yi00YmZkLTgyYjQtMmFjMjhmNDU1OTJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM1MTE1NDMx._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Yes despite the wig she wears, due to the fact her hair was cropped short for her previous films, she is as lovely as ever. One of my favorite films of all time and certainly the best one that deals with insanity in and honest and true way, not only avoiding the clichÃÂ©' but completely reversing it and debunking the stereotype. Robert Rossen is a great director, one of history's most under-appreciated and few others could helm this story the way he does. Based on the novel by J.R. Salamanca, the story is of a young war vetern who returns home and seeks a job at the local mental institute. There he gets too involved with several of the patients and learns much about their past, which reflects the tragedy in his own life involving his mother.It's true Warren Beatty does play the role blandly and stiff. While that's a turn off for many people watching the film, I think they fail to understand that just like Ryan O'Neil in Barry Lyndon, it's the character they're playing. Not the actor and certainly not the direction. Wonderful supporting cast from Kim Hunter and Peter Fonda as well as a brilliant cameo by Gene Hackman, which oozes of a marriage gone sour in his bit part.It's a very hard film to figure out because so much is left untold and rightfully so leaving the audience to decide what happened. Playing on the fable of the past coming back to haunt us it plays deeply on buried memories and traumatic life experiences that were covered up rather than confronted. There is so much positive to say about this amazing film, but even so it's actress Jean Seberg that is the crown jewell in this picture. Criminally underseen, now that it is on DVD anyone interested in deep character studies should make it a point to watch this ASAP.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJhMzBkY2QtYjkzMC00OWNjLThmYWQtNjgxOTU5NGE0ZTM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It shows and it needs to be shown that the sexual organs are just another part of the human anatomy and that the day of the Garden of Eden fig leaf is ( or should be ) over. It is also in my opinion dealing with the disparity of the rich and the poor and the sado-masochistic relationship that can develop when the two collide in what is here a non-love story.

I have read many, many reviews which seem to have been written by those who have little to no idea of just how complex and difficult Toni Morrison's original novel can be.  Of course Beloved (the movie) will be long, and of course it will be emotionally draining and even confusing - the book was!  That said, I loved the novel and the film version of it, which follows the original material almost verbatim.  (To try and change the story would be to tamper needlessly with a Pulitzer and Nobel Prize-winning book).  I am no Oprah nut but she obviously had a deep respect and understanding for the story, which is evident in her surprisingly understated acting.  Thandie Newton was simply amazing; I am glad I watched the film if for nothing else than the chance to see her performance (which, to be honest, has helped a key facet of the book make sense for me).  The production design is flawless, and, as always, Jonathan Demme proves he's more than above average as a director.

Even though its marketing all but spoils its most major revelation, the flick still plays as a relatively unassuming drama until a final exposition dump aims to re-contextualise its plot, turning the affair into a pseudo thriller. Perhaps this is an effort to provoke a second viewing, but the movie doesn't have an ounce of ambiguity or, indeed, foreshadowing. It makes for a completely blindsiding ending that has little to no consequence because it feels so utterly disconnected from everything we've seen prior. The protagonist is suddenly transformed into something they never were before and we're just expected to accept it, to change allegiances at the last minute. This is a big ask and it makes for an unsatisfying end. Conceptually, it's fine, it's just that its execution doesn't capitalise on its potential. The picture isn't bad, though. It's forgettable and retroactively strained but it's engaging enough. The two leads are as good as you'd expect, playing ever-so-slightly against type and feeling comfortable while doing so. The actual writing is decent, if a little cheesy, and the direction is competent. There are a couple of OAP scuffles that work surprisingly well, too. Generally, it's relatively enjoyable throughout, despite some eye-rolling moments. It does feel a bit 'BBC 2' but it's not a bad effort, even though it's already fading from my memory. 6/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhNTY5ZTUtYzc1NC00NjUyLWI1NDQtYWE3YmJlNjQ3OGVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"
"The Army of Shadows","2021.0","","145.0","Drama, War","8.1","99.0","Jean-Pierre Melville","Lino Ventura, Paul Meurisse, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Simone Signoret","25,929","An account of underground resistance fighters in Nazi-occupied France.","88","Recommended-now if only Bush, Blair et. al. could only see this they might learn something about patriotism","Today, watching a film like Mr.and Mrs. North (2005) or one of the Bourne or Mission Impossibles or any of the current crop of 'action' films up to and including the latest Kung Fu spectacular with invulnerable flying fighting machines, seems to have rendered the genre into a profitable degeneracy rendering the depiction of actual human beings or their cinematic similitude obsolete as cave paintings. That anyone could be entertained by the goings on of a Charlie's Angles movie puzzles me. I do know there is no audience for a genuine film detailing the lives and works of a genuine underground resistance like that of the French during the German Nazi occupation.This might be the most mundane, matter-of-fact war movie since Robert Montgomery's overlooked masterpiece The Gallant Hours. This is because the people, patriots all, who rose to fight, were pretty ordinary people from rather prosaic walks of life. When it come to resisting a foreign tyranny in the form of an occupying army it isn't a bunch of professionally trained assassins who can be counted on but politically aware citizens who organize. These are ordinary people who had to rise to a situation. It is pure Existentialism.This is a very spare, almost Jansenist version of the true story of the French Resistance. This Melville is, as usual, the opposite side of the coin from his twin, Robert Bresson. At one point the central character played by Lino Ventura, escapes by simply running away. He is helped along the way by a man who doesn't even mention the situation or his role in assisting. Its just done because that is what one does. The German's are hardly seen as this film is simply not about them. Each death, there are very, very few of them, is a moral and ethical agony. At least for the resistance. The torture scenes are all off camera.Directoral moments are minimal, such as when Ventura buys a new suit and shoes and then must leave them behind. Its like what soldiers say about combat, extreme longueurs of boredom interrupted by moments of sheer terror. The truth behind the story is that the German Gestapo commander, Klaus Barbie, the so called Butcher of Lyon, was a war criminal who was spirited out of Europe after the war by the US to train military regimes in South America in the techniques of torture that he perfected in France.In one of the set pieces British STOL Lysander aircraft land to and take off to bring certain resistance members to London. This scene features the actual aircraft. This was particularly amazing as most Melville films suffer from budgetary constrictions which usually effect the realism of certain scenes (see the helicopter/train transfer in Un Flic) and there were possibly only two airworthy Lysanders at the time of the filming of L' ArmÃÂ©e des ombres. The parachuting scene is also so nicely judged in its almost prosaic ordinariness, yet we know its still a jump into the seemingly limitless darkness, but which would aggravate the ADD generation. The dry, almost Islandic renderings of scenes, sometimes to the level of an Industrial film, reminds me of the flat rendering Truffaut did of simply fueling a car at a service station in Le Peau Douce. This is why Melville and Bresson were the honorary mentors of the New Wave. It was a further adaptation of Realism and neo-realism but with an awareness that at all times it was a film and therefore an adaption of reality but distorted only to make the truth more vivid.It is a pity if, as I think, this film will fail to connect with a generation saturated on the super hero shenanigans of SFX dare-a-doings. One writer pointed out the ridiculousness of someone deliberately sending himself to prison in order to deliver a cyanide capsule, totally discounting true sacrifice for the type of action where the pretty actors manage to survive almost any cataclysm so that in the end, after the death of countless nameless and faceless minions and the elimination of the satanic villain-in-chief, while ankle deep in gore, they can have a nice chuckle. Hey babes, that's entertainment.Looking at the restored version of L' ArmÃÂ©e des ombres just emphasizes the death of film culture, not because there are no writers and directors who can make films like this but because there are no audiences for films like this. Highly recommended.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MTUyNTA2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQzMDg1NjE@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Some people are interviewed about Brooklyn, spiced up with statistics on Brooklyn.","45","An understated, but brilliant film","Blue in the face is a follow up to 'Smoke' a film which I saw recently and very much enjoyed. I thought I'd give this one a try as well. Like the first film (even more so) this is a collection of beautifully acted, largely improvised vignettes, involving the customers and general passers-by of the Brooklyn based cigar shop run by Auggie (Harvey Keitel). There is a lose storyline involving the relationship between Auggie and his girlfriend Violetta (brilliantly played by Mel Gorham) and the troubled marriage of Vinnie the storeowner and his wife. The store has been a part of the local community for years and when Vinnie gets a very good offer to sell up, it's bound to badly affect a lot of people. The best moments of the film lie in the documentary style rambling of Brooklyn residents (including Lou Reed) as they describe what it means to them being part of the city, and also the brilliant monologues that some of the characters perform. There are moments of genius in this film. It is very funny in a very understated way, the assembled characters are all eccentric in their own way but totally believable. The dialogue is natural and you get to know and feel for the characters very quickly in to the movie. I loved this film; I thought it was better than 'Smoke' a film I also liked. 'Blue in the Face' might be harder to get in to for some people, it's improvisational style and lack of structured story might put people off or make  them think it's hard to follow, but it isn't. Don't try to make too much sense of what's going on you don't need to. Treat it as a series of snapshots in to the lives of a collection of colourful New Yorkers. Just sit back and watch the characters play out their lives, you'll very soon be engrossed by it.It was an absolute delight to watch.

You should expect surreal surprises, and my advice would be to not read too much about it before watching it, so you can just let the film happen to you, like an art experience. Don't expect this story of a man (a fully committed Denis Lavant) taking on 9 different personas in a day in Paris to make any neat logical sense, this is a film of dreams and ideas - music, madness, death, sex, despair and comedy. It seems to be about questions around acting - what does it mean to be an actor? aren't we all playing the part of our own lives? what does performing a role cost us? how does a performance manage to move us so intensely? I saw this at the Sydney Film Festival with a large audience, and it was interesting listening to people's laughter. Sometimes that was in response to a comic scene, but at other times it seemed more that a startling idea or image left some people not knowing how else to respond (eg a very odd short scene near the end, as Denis ends his workday, caused some people to laugh, while I found it terribly moving). The delight is in the individual scenes, though some of the scenarios have a real sadness to them: the motion capture scene, where human movement proves spellbinding in a way that CGI can never be; the sad tale of the daughter returning home after a party; the wonderfully crazed and uncomfortable Eva Mendes segment (make sure you check out the writing on the gravestones); and the surprisingly dramatic scene featuring pop icon Kylie Minogue (whose other film appearances were never anything like this). The tone and quality isn't consistent the whole way through, which can feel like a flaw, but it also keeps you on your toes. You might find parts of it pretentious or difficult to interpret, but the next moment you may be moved and not know why. It will definitely make most of the films you've watched recently seem very very dull.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk2MDc4MDk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTcyODY1OA@@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The only reason I decided to was due to: 1) lack of reviews, and most importantly 2) the very few reviews that have been posted here are so incomprehensively negative that the only explanation I can come up with was that they had to be shills (which is surprising to me, as most 'shills' on IMDb are only here to artificially increase a film's positive reviews).That being said, I found these these first two negative reviews utterly baffling. Now I'm no expert film critic, but movies are my number one passion in life. As such, I've seen so many that I've literally arrived to the point where I'm thoroughly jaded...so much so that most everything that I've seen usually leaves me both bored and uninterested, or at best, mildly amused. Now that I've had my mini-rant, I'll continue on with my review.As the title of the film implies, the story is as basic as it gets: a mother's son gets kidnapped, and said mother stops at nothing to get him back. From that simple premise (which has been rehashed millions of times), I began watching this with the expectation that I'll be seeing one clichÃÂ© after another, with gratuitous violence and over-blown CGI and/or cheesy effects mixed in for good measure. I can honestly say that not only were those expectations overturned, but for the first time that I can remember, I was literally sat on the edge of my seat and kept in suspense throughout. That statement may sound generic and trite, but coming from a jaded cinephile, it becomes a huge compliment.I never lost interest for a second, and the sheer intensity and suspense that I felt throughout 'Kidnap' got to the level where I was actively looking to see how many more minutes was left before it endedÃÂnot because I was bored and wanted to know how much more tedium I had to suffer, but so that I could tell how much more hell the protagonist (and by extension, I) had to go through before all the nail-biting suspense could finally come to an end.It was a taught cat-and-mouse thriller expertly choreographed, and Halle Berry's acting was sublime! In fact, I was initially so put-off by the film's synopsis, I would have passed this over in an instant had it not been for the fact that Ms Berry was in it! The acting, cinematography and stunt-work were masterfully crafted in such a way so as to get you emotionally invested throughout. I think that is why this film engendered such a visceral reaction whilst watching it. If you cannot relate to nor care about the characters, the film you're watching falls flat, and you consequently lose interest very quickly. Not so with 'Kidnap'. The relatability of Berry's character, plus the superb job she did with this role, puts you right in the car seat next to her.If you are like me, and suffer from the ennui that inevitably comes from having seen almost every movie ever made, and are looking for the proverbial 'white knuckle ride' and adrenaline rush, then I cannot recommend 'Kidnap' strongly enough. In fact, I wouldn't be exaggerating to say that this is on my top 4 list of films I've seen this year thus far!So in a way, I give thanks to the two negative reviewers. Had it not been for them, I wouldn't have even bothered writing this review!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyNDgyODEzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI4MTA2MjI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It is at once a black comedy, a horror movie with a unique setting, and a biting sendup of the art and business of moviemaking.  And the fact is that it wears each of these hats quite well, although not necessarily at the same time.The movie asks us to imagine:  What if Max Schreck, the mysterious guy who gave what is still considered one of the best vampire performances ever, did so well because, well, he really was a vampire?  The skulking creature, we are to imagine, was finagled into performing in ""Nosferatu"" for legendary cinema pioneer F.W. Murnau.  The story then follows as the crew makes the movie dealing with all sorts of difficulties, not the least of which is the star's habit of snacking on cameramen.Among the film's many virtues is its portrayal of filmmaking in what was really its dawn as a form of art and commerce.  People like me, who have trouble with silent movies may gain an additional appreciation for the work and craft that went in to them, and realize that while they may seem hokey and stylized to us now, they had a beauty and substance that was all their own, and still is.John Malkovich turns in a great performance as the visionary Murnau (who, while tortured, must be a genius because he always gets it in one take). It is a characteristic Malkovich role, a rationalist given to bouts of fury, and it is as much fun to see him discourse pretentiously on the science and art of the moving image as it is to see him pitch a fit (""Albon, a NATIVE has wandered into my FRAME!"").The core of this movie, however, and deservedly so, is Willem Dafoe's unforgettable portrayal of Schreck.  This is not your slick-talking Anne-Rice undead-Vogue kinda vampire.  Schreck is the next thing up from a rat, squatting in filth and clicking his claws, and Dafoe is able to inspire laughter as well as fear, and even pathos.  He makes us imagine what a rotten existence it must be, to have eternal life alone in a rotting ruin and a withered body.  He and Malkovich have some great scenes together, including a sick, hilarious moment when Schreck and Murnau try to hammer out who on the crew may or may not be snacked upon (the cinematographer is necessary, it seems, but the script girl is negotiable).The movie functions best as a sendup of moviemaking, as the harried Murnau must deal with temperamental actors, unfriendly locals, blood-sucking undead, and other hazards of the movie trade.  At one point, Murnau must leave to calm the investors, a scene I really wish had been included. Some of the best moments are those of the age-old creature of the night attempting to take direction and find his ""motivation.""  Everyone is afraid of Schreck, but admire the dedication that keeps him in character all the time (he's a Method actor, explains Murnau, he studied with Stanislavsky). The movie makes its point rather neatly, that filmmakers, and by extension filmmaking itself, have a way of sucking the life and blood out of you. Anyone who has ever had to shoot a movie on location will attest to this.If I have a complaint about the movie, it is only that after its extreme cleverness, it settles for a somewhat straightforward horror-style denouement.  Myself, I would have thought the vampire would end up moving to Berlin and getting an agent, a swimming pool, and a meeting with Ovitz. Still, the movie clearly makes its point: an auteur driven by a mania for artistic perfection can be more of a monster than something that just lives in a cave and drinks blood from your neck.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTVjMzdhMGQtYjkzNy00YTUxLTkwMmEtMjEyZTYxOTVlNTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The only aspect that really works well here is the initial setup and how it all starts which manages to bring about a highly effective use of chilling imagery to figure out what's going on. The whole idea of the characters being stuck in the afterlife with no idea themselves comes about rather well and the moody location offers the kind of intriguing starting point that gets this going on a high note. As well, with the way the films' approach to things includes a well-worn treatise on grief and the processing of trauma the way he comes across the other individuals who are stuck there like they are manages to be a highly effective setup that discusses the nature of sin in such a way as to be quite impressive overall. Beyond that, though, there's not a whole lot to say about this one since the structure of what's going on isn't all that enjoyable. This is due to the anthology structure present which makes very little sense for how it's incorporated. The inclusion in the middle of the film with very little warning that isn't that interesting beyond a one-note setup makes for some cliched stereotype setpieces to come about while only dealing with some rather bland and pedestrian themes. That they take up so much of the running time in the middle of the film offers up the kind of non-genre guilt trip that these stories are based on that it feels so shoehorned into this with the story of the murderous child being so confusing with where it takes place and how it all comes together with the imaginary friend that it's hard to enjoy it while the second story is barely genre-related at all about the bullied teen with so much of it about the mother's guilt for what happened. These aren't that interesting to watch and really just turn this off overall.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTcwZDk0ZTktZWNiMy00OTYzLTkzNGUtMjk5MTJjYjdiMDI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzMxODcyNTk@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

However, through a series of misunderstandings, both Johnny's family and his girl think he's a coward, and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier.  Months pass, and Johnny, sad and alone, is piloting his train ÃÂ the General ÃÂ when it is stolen from him by the North.  Johnny's efforts to recover the General ÃÂ and to win back his girl's love ÃÂ become an unbelievably funny and action-packed series of events, as Johnny tries to go from being a sad-sack buffoon to being a hero.If you haven't watched many silent films, they demand a greater amount of attention than `normal' film ÃÂ there are no audio cues; and volumes can be spoken with a simple facial expression.  Buster Keaton is amazingly expressive, as he's fully capable of going from wildly happy to downtrodden and sad in the blink of an eye.  While funny, Keaton is much more than just a clownish figure ÃÂ he manages to evoke a lot of sympathy as well, and he genuinely becomes what can only be described as an action hero as well.  His timing, whether for a joke or for a tender moment, is absolutely impeccable.What's also great about `The General' is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor ÃÂ a movie like this couldn't be made today.  No amount of insurance would cover it.  Keaton does all his own stunts, and manages to perform a number of feats that are simultaneously hilarious and dangerous ÃÂ he chases down `The General' with a bike, he sits on a moving cattlecatcher, knocking away railroad ties with a tie of his own.  All these stunts are fantastic, but it's scary to think that any one of these probably could've killed Keaton if something even went slightly wrong.   `The General' is a lot more than slapstick.  Personally, I think it's one of the first films to push the envelope of movies ÃÂ it goes for action, romance, and humor, and it pulls all of those elements together into a terrific movie. If you've never seen Buster Keaton ÃÂ or, for that matter, a silent film ÃÂ go find this one and watch it.  It's a classic.

Charmingly cast with Margaret Lockwood, Michael Redgrave, and Dame May Witty in the leads, the extremely witty script mixes 1930s romantic froth with increasingly tense suspense in the story of sharp witted young woman (Lockwood) who befriends an elderly lady (Witty) during a train journey--and is extremely disturbed when, as the title states, the lady vanishes.Many regard this as the best of Hitchcock's early work, and it is easy to see why: the film demonstrates his growing talent for building suspense from an unlikely mix of the commonplace and the incredible. He is also remarkably blessed in his cast, with Lockwood and Redgrave possessing considerable chemistry and Dame May Witty particularly endearing in one of the character roles at which she so excelled; the supporting cast is also particularly memorable.Hitchcock guides them all with never a misstep through a complex script that progresses from very lighthearted to extremely sinister and then back again, and the result leaves audiences with both the satisfaction of a well-made thriller and the glow of a romantic comedy. Although it lacks the subtle tones of his later work, THE LADY VANISHES is among my own favorites by Hitchcock, and fans who have never seen it are in for a real treat. Highly recommended.Gary F.

The director filmed a screwball romantic comedy as if it were a dark, artsy film---weird camera angles, blue filtered shots, lingering, close up looks at raindrops. Steve Zahn was good, as always.  Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; he was perfect for a romantic comedy.  Sandra Bullock struggled along valiantly with a character who was supposed to be zany, but whose wackiness consisted of things like madly kissing a husband she hated, abandoning her child, going on carnival rides, offering to strip for money, and bumming a ride with a fellow airline passenger.  The script had very few funny lines; there was no physical comedy; it was boring.  It introduced potentially funny situations, then cut them off before they could develop.  To top it all off, the ""twist"" at the end was a slap in the face to anyone expecting a fun romantic comedy.

I speak from experience. David Cronenberg's film, ""Spider"", is the other. I was disappointed in my two favourite critics, James Berardinelli and Roger Ebert, each of who gave ""The Soloist"" only 62ÃÂ½%. Berardinelli says, ""The Soloist is afflicted with a lack of passion. The story lacks a strong trajectory; it meanders, seemingly unsure of precisely what it wants to do and say and where it wants to go."" Actually, that is the reality of schizophrenia. One never knows what is going to happen next. There are many setbacks. He also says, ""The soundtrack supplies multiple, overlapping voices. The objective is to invite the viewer to participate in the unhinging of Nathaniel's mind, a first-person perspective of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, it feels artificial and contrived."" I have taught seven NAMI* courses on mental illness. One episode in one of the classes involves requiring class members to perform certain simple tasks while being bombarded by random voices from behind. Many class members find that to be the most unnerving, and illuminating, of all the activities in the course.Ebert misses the point when he says, ""Yes, mental illness can be like that, but can successful drama? There comes a point when Lopez has had enough, and so, in sympathy, have we."" Dealing with a mentally ill person can be devastatingly frustrating. Must we always be entertained? There is a place for grim reality in drama. Otherwise, how can we learn?""The Soloist"" is as accurate a representation of schizophrenia as you could experience without becoming mentally ill yourself. If you keep that in mind then the film will be rewarding; if, however, you are looking for a film that makes sense easily and progresses from point to point in a logical manner, then look for a different film.If you choose to watch the film and absorb the reality of mental illness, then you will learn much. You never know when that knowledge will be of great value to you. Then again, you may be spared, and never need it.The film introduces a very important idea: mentally ill people do better if there is someone, whom they trust, who takes an abiding interest in them.It also poses one very important question: should mentally ill persons be forced to take medication to stabilize themselves? Different states, provinces and countries have different laws concerning this. Some feel that mentally ill persons should be forced to take medication if and only if they are likely to harm themselves or others. Mentally ill persons are often unaware that they are mentally ill, and cannot be convinced otherwise. Would they have more freedom to decide correctly for themselves if they were first medicated until they become sane? The film addresses this question but does not attempt to give a definitive answer. You will have to think out that question yourself, keeping in mind that different people have different reactions to the same medication. There is no universal answer, but for each individual, there is probably a best answer but not necessarily a good one.The film captivated me from the beginning to the end. I did not miss the common devices that some movies use to make them exciting. There was excitement enough for me in the growth of the principal characters and in the learning that I did, and in the thinking that I was forced to do.*NAMI is The National Alliance on Mental Illness.P.S. Schizophrenia has absolutely nothing to do with having multiple personalities, or of dichotomies (apparent contradictions). The split in the expression ""split personality"" is the split between the personality and reality. Unfortunately, the word is misused far more often that it is used correctly.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExODQ3MTI5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDEyMTQ5MQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Bing sold a few records of that one, albeit they were 78s back then, and Elvis nicely revives it and sells a few more. Crosby's film was made to take advantage of a whole lot of publicity he received for a trip to Hawaii. But Paramount as they usually did with his films back they made them on the cheap and Hawaii for Waikiki Wedding was recreated on the back lot.Bing must have been a little jealous and who could have blamed him when Paramount did this film completely on location in Hawaii for the King. And Elvis got to go back to Hawaii for another film in Paradise, Hawaiian Style. Elvis got a whole lot of musical numbers here including the title tune which he sings over the opening credits. He does a rockabilly version of the French song Alouette and with different lyrics, the Mexican love ballad, La Paloma. And he borrows a hit from Andy Williams when he reprises the Hawaiian Wedding Song. Of course no film set in Hawaii is complete without Aloha Oe. But the big song from this film is one of Presley's greatest Can't Help Falling In Love With You. He sings it during a scene for a birthday party for Joan Blackman's grandmother. It's sort of done in a throwaway manner like the producer's didn't think it would be the big number in the film. It might surprise Presley fans that this blockbuster hit was also recorded by another RCA Victor artist named Perry Como for one of his albums. Perry does a nice job with it, but it ain't a patch on the King's version.Elvis is a rich young kid who'd like very much to get out from under Mom and Dad and prove himself. He's even done a hitch in the army, but that doesn't help. Parents are played by Roland Winters and Angela Lansbury.Angela Lansbury recounted a story where she and her husband had dinner with Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis when they were casting Blue Hawaii. She said Elvis was a nice, polite young man who barely said three words during the dinner. The talk was all from Colonel Tom who was making all kinds of offers to the future Jessica Fletcher to be in this film. Angela's career was somewhat in a dry spell, she hadn't made The Manchurian Candidate yet or appeared on Broadway in Mame. So she was quite willing to appear.I gained some insight into how Colonel Parker handled Elvis with that story. If you look at the cast and even the behind the camera credits of his films, you'll see them populated with a whole lot of Hollywood veterans. I'll bet there were many such dinners during Elvis's film career.To be sure Presley was certainly the Colonel's meal ticket. But I would have to say that he made every effort to see that Elvis and his films were given the best possible production values. I think that's why the King had a long sustained film career until public tastes change which they inevitably do. Also musicals, even Elvis's became too cost prohibitive to produce any more.Blue Hawaii marks the height of Presley's singing and film career. The Beatles hadn't come on the scene yet, the King was still ruling the roost on the record charts and his films were grossing big box office. And unless your Bing Crosby and feel a twinge of jealousy that his Hawaii film was done on the cheap, you'll like Blue Hawaii very much. It's nice entertainment from a great entertainer.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWViMzI5YjYtZWUzYi00OTgyLWJjODUtMjA1Zjg4NDcxOTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc5NjEzNA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It steals from just about every prison movie ever made, especially ""Midnight Express"", ""Lock Up"", ""The Green Mile"" etc, and with a bit of ""Shawshank Redemption"" thrown in for good measure. So, if this is the case then why have I given the movie 8 out of 10? Because it's the best Van Damme movie I've ever seen.Jean-Claude's films are made to appeal to fans of the kind of action film that disappeared from cinemas about 10 years ago: the unthinking, violent, easy-on-the-brain popcorn fodder that he, Arnie and Sly used to churn out by the bucket load. These days, Van Dame is much like Seagal in that all their films go direct-to-video (or DVD, as it now is). However, where as Seagal's post-fame efforts are united by their awfulness, Van Damme has, with ""In Hell"", made a real effort to do something a bit different.So, he has no real martial arts skills, and no cheesy one-liners. Instead, he actually acts, and it's quite something to behold. Okay, he's never going to win any awards, but it's nice to see he's making the effort. Director Ringo Lam shoots the movie brilliantly, making it look a trillion pounds when in fact it probably cost about 50p to make. The supporting cast are quite good as well, with no terrible performances rearing up to ruin the film. I must admit, too, that I was quite moved by certain sections, and you could really feel for the prisoners trapped 'in hell' (what a title!).So, in conclusion, give this movie a watch, and enjoy it- just ignore that you probably know where the plot is going long before it's even got there.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDljNzc1MTctNDY2Zi00OGRhLTkwMmUtMmVlY2MwNjMzMzA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUyOTc1NDYz._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I was left feeling surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had anything to do with this turkey, individually or collectively.The film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and I like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall. But once the twist was revealed, the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable, the underlying motive for revenge was ill-conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for Bobby Earl was ridiculously far-fetched. What's worse is that, once the twist was revealed, the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable.Harris gave a terrific performance and Connery is like Morgan Freeman in that he never gives a bad performance, even if the movie ain't that great! So all in all, it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmVkYTgyYWQtYTdiYS00NTk1LWEzZGItYTExYWFiZWMzYjRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Although this film becomes more highly regarded as the years go by, especially by non-Americans, it is usually regarded as just a well made soaper.  Big mistake.  This is a very angry film, a scathing commentary on the conformity and mindlessness that characterized much of the 1950s. Remember, this film was made in 1955, before there were any beatniks or hippies, before the civil rights movement, before there was any pot smoking, before anyone beyond the fringes questioned any of the basic values underlying capitalist America.  America was at the peak of its power and prestige, and this was perhaps the first mainstream film that questioned the values that presumably were responsible for that ascendancy.  Because this film is essentially about class and the primacy that human relationships must have over material gain, social acceptance, and social conformity.Think of the forbidden (at the time) themes that this film deals with. Older woman, younger man.  The shallowness, insipidity, and snobbery of the upper middle class arrivistes who have ""made it,"" all of which masks their basic insecurity, unhappiness, and self-loathing.  A male lead who doesn't care about acceptance by anyone, who doesn't care about money or success, who just wants to be happy and ""do his own thing,"" well over a decade before that phrase was coined.  The Wyman character foolishly (at first) decides that acceptance by her peers and children is more important than finding happiness with a man she truly loves, and what does she end up with for companionship?  A television set!  This was the decade in which ""The Lonely Crowd"" was published, and this film exemplifies that concept, as well as striking examples of other- vs. inner-directed, far better than any other film of its time.Sirk was truly a visionary, well ahead of his time.  This was why this film inspired Fassbinder's ""Ali: Fear Eats the Soul"" and Todd Haynes' ""Far from Heaven.""  It is all the more powerful for having been made then and in not being a retrospective look, as is ""Far from Heaven,"" from a more ""enlightened"" future time.

I had previously turned down several offers for the film rights to my own book because I felt it unlikely that those projects would result in a film truthful to the essence of the man I had come to know so well. All I can say is that the makers of ""Hollywoodland"" came as close as is humanly possible in the real world of movie-making to achieving exactly what I would have hoped for -- an examination of George Reeves's life and death that is true to the times he lived in, true to the kind of man I found him to be, and as true as possible to the most likely scenarios that have been projected to explain his death. While this is not a biography nor a documentary, and while adhering to each and every fact of Reeves's life would have resulted in a film exactly as long as his life, the artists here have done a powerful and affecting job of telling Reeves's story, and have framed it in a fictional setting that illuminates rather than obscures the truth. In any event, in any life, there is what happened and then there is the truth, and the two may not always equally serve our understanding of the event or life in question. It is true that ""Hollywoodland"" takes occasional liberties with specific facts, in no less way than Shakespeare took liberties with the real life facts of Hamlet or Julius Caesar. But as Alfred Hitchcock said, drama is life with the dull bits left out. What matters is not whether a costume is the right shade of blue or whether there's really a gas station at the intersection of Sunset and Benedict Canyon. What matters is whether the essence of a true story has been faithfully told. And ""Hollywoodland"" does a superb job of portraying that essence, who George Reeves was, what his world was like, and what impact he had on those who knew him and those who only knew of him. Allen Coulter, the director, has done a splendid job capturing the era and has paid enormous attention both to period detail and to the details of the lives of the real-life characters. Only Reeves's fans (and not even many of them) will notice the pinkie ring on Ben Affleck's finger or the widow's peak in his hairline or the exotic Alvis auto he owns, yet these are all completely authentic to the actual Reeves. More importantly, Coulter has done an exemplary job of making Reeves into a human being, one whose dreams we ache for almost as much as he does in the story.Adrien Brody, as the fictional detective whose story provides the audience a window into Reeves's life, is solid and manages to bring a little charisma to the comparative low-life he plays. Diane Lane is superb as Reeves's lover, the sexually hungry but aging Toni Mannix. And Ben Affleck does certainly his best dramatic work ever as George Reeves. In makeup, and with his own matching cleft chin, Affleck sometimes looks astonishing like the real Reeves. But more importantly, he captures the haunted quality of the actor on a treadmill to oblivion, as well as the immense charm for which the real Reeves is widely remembered in Hollywood. Although the script does not give any of the actors the kind of deeply meaty scenes that win Oscars, some of the hardest work to do is for an actor to excel in scenes that don't require fireworks. Affleck in particular does so in this film, and I think it does him credit. He is reported to have researched the role intensely, and it shows. The performances of Larry Cedar, Bob Hoskins, and Lois Smith also stand out especially distinctively.The cinematography is stunning, with the frequent flashbacks clearly distinguishable from the ""present day"" scenes without the distinction being glaring or even obvious. And the musical score is elegant and very evocative of the time.It is perhaps inevitable that die-hard Superman fans, for whom George Reeves is not so much a human being as he is a sort of superhero himself, will find things to carp and cavil about in this film. As a researcher with over thirty years of in-depth study of Reeves's life, I can split hairs over details pretty easily myself. And I suspect, too, that some of the complaints will be about the depiction of things that are actually true, but which don't show Reeves in a worshipful light. All I can say is that I have spent my adult life studying, admiring, and trying to understand the man whose story this film tells, and I think George Reeves would be touched and proud of the care these filmmakers have taken. I highly recommend ""Hollywoodland.""","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4ODQ2OTI5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDIyNjYzMQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Honesty in Presentation = 0","First let me say that, as a person (a Canadian for anybody who might question if all the negative reviews are from the USA) who doesn't care for guns and has no interest in them -- I've never even held one -- upon first viewing of ""Bowling for Columbine"" I was a fan. I loved this film. I even bought the DVD. I thought it was a brilliant documentary and that its presentation of the facts was spot on.However, the scene where Moore talks about a bomber on display in the desert and the army plaque beneath it always made me wonder exactly how honest he was being, since what he claimed the plaque said sounded too outrageous to me. It kept on grating me until about a year later I began to actually research his film and found that nearly every single thing Moore presents in BFC is either heavily manipulated facts or bald-faced deceptions.Take the scene of him getting a gun for opening an account at a bank. What he does not show is that there was a criminal background check including photo ID check and an FBI background check. Then, to get the gun, he had to open a 10 year Certificate of Deposit... basically he had to deposit nearly $1000 before he could get the gun, not the smartest idea compared to just buying a gun if that's the only intent. Even then, when Moore gets his gun and asks about the safety of handing out guns in the bank, the audience is duped into forgetting a large portion of Moore's handing-out-a-gun-at-a-bank safety joke: the bank doesn't supply the ammunition!You even have his little cartoon where he tries to link the NRA to the KKK... never mind that him saying the NRA was formed the same year that the KKK was declared an illegal organization is 100% wrong... never mind that the NRA was actually formed by Northern Yankee's who fought AGAINST slavery... never mind that the NRA was primarily created in reaction to Southern laws that would ban blacks from owning firearms (the exact opposite of the cartoon's suggestion the NRA wanted to suppress blacks and leave them defenseless)... never mind that the cartoon is a South Park rip-off, presented after an interview with South Park creator Matt Stone in order to make it seem like the cartoon was made by the creators of South Park. I mean, no wonder Matt Stone hates Moore and made him a target of insults in his ""Team America: World Police"" movie. Talk about complete deception from every angle.What's worse is that he is even hypocritical in how he talks about America's culture of fear and how the media tries to instill fear in the population, and yet that is EXACTLY what BFC is: a film that presents manipulated facts in order to create fear. Probably the best refutation of BFC one can find is the in-depth article by Dave Kopel called ""Bowling Truths"" that literally shreds BFC from beginning to end, showing it to be -- as he puts it -- more of a 'mockumentary' in the vein of ""This is Spinal Tap"" than a serious documentary outlining anything close to reality.In terms of gun control issues, if you really want an intelligent look at the problems of gun control, check out the episode of Penn & Teller's Bullsh*t on gun control. Now THAT is an intelligent and more importantly an HONEST delving into gun control. But if you are looking for facts and honesty in subject matter, you couldn't find a worse choice than BFC.BFC is insulting to anybody who would be willing to take the time and educate themselves on exactly how honest Moore is. If you think BFC is truthful and honest, go read Kopel's article (readily available on the net) and you'll see how much Moore stretches the truth. I mean, even the film's title is deceptive since -- as even the preliminary police report states -- the two shooters at Columbine never showed up for bowling that morning! I still own the DVD, if only to show people a perfect example of how sheep can be led around if they don't stop and ask whether what they are hearing is real. BFC offers little reality and a lot of political brouhaha that does little for intelligent discussion on gun control. In that, he has hurt the gun control movement more than he has helped it.(And by the way, people in Canada do lock their doors. I have to wonder how many doors he had to try in order to get his shots of every door being open.)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWY2OWM1ODEtNDU5OS00MjMwLTliYzItZWZlOTEyYmQ2Njg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

However, right from the start, the viewers know he is just pretending to be stupid, as he makes many mental calculations on all possible permutations of events in his head. Such a double life requires a lot of dedication and perseverance.The second half of the film turns into a adrenaline fuelled action film, with much brutal fist fights and valiant defiance of orders. It is presented so well, that it keeps people captivated with the three men's psychological struggle and physical struggle. They manage to take down tens of tough guys in fist fights normally is unrealistic and even annoyingly silly, but in ""Secretly, Greatly"" their seemingly omnipotent fists provide something for viewers to marvel at. Maybe it is because they are not just fighting for the sake of fighting, but fighting for survival, both physically and ideologically against a tyrannical regime.The interspersed subplot about the idiot's longing for his mother is very touching. In the three men's native country, people are brainwashed to believe that the party is way more important than their blood family. Hence there is a constant deep seated struggle; and their longings could never be fulfilled. The plot is profoundly powerful towards the end of the film, when everything culminates to an emotional and action climax.""Secretly, Greatly"" is a great gem that deserves to be seen.

That for me takes away form the central story and starts to take on the role of a social commentary on the way people live in Britain.In the first half of the film there are only 2 references to a fire, so rather than Frankie's search for the truth of what happened to her, the first half of the film is nothing but anti-social behaviour, swearing, arguments and graphic, but completely unnecessary lesbian sex.I'm sitting here at the half way stage still waiting for the story to start and for someone to be able to speak English.I've given it a 2 and that's more than it's worth.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGFmNDJjYjMtYzk4My00MzNkLTg1MDktZDdlNTBhZTFlMjBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTc2ODM2NzM@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's the inner struggle of a man whose pacifist Christian beliefs came into conflict with his patriotism. It's the heart and soul of this film, beautifully crafted by director Howard Hawks.The real Sergeant York eschewed all money making ventures that would have capitalized on his heroics in World War I and had resisted giving the rights to his story to Hollywood. He relented because in 1941 he became concerned with the danger fascism posed for the world and advocated preparedness. Part of what brought him out was the speechmaking of that other American hero Charles A. Lindbergh who was an appeasement advocate. York even called the shots on who was to play him. So Jack Warner made a call to Adolph Zukor over at Paramount and probably paid one hefty sum for Gary Cooper's services. It was worth every penny of it as Cooper got his first Oscar for Best Actor.Alvin York is a poor farmer supporting a widowed mother and a brother and sister. And he likes to cut loose every so often with a jug and a rifle. But he gets converted and gets involved in Walter Brennan's church which is a strict fundamentalist sort with pacifist tenets. When America gets into World War I, his very soul is tormented by the tenets of his church and the volunteer tradition of his state. Tennessee is known as the Volunteer State and that nickname is no lie. It bothers him more than other men because as Pastor Walter Brennan tells him he's ""got the using kind of religion.""These people may be fundamentalists and somewhat backward, but they're not phonies. No high hog living preachers here, just simple people trying to get through life the best they can. Howard Hawks did a masterful job in casting this film with some actors very used to playing rustics. Ward Bond, Noah Beery, Jr. Howard DaSilva, Clem Bevans and most of all Walter Brennan as Pastor Rosier Pyle, tripling as preacher, postmaster, and owner of the general store. Brennan got an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but since he'd already won three of them, the Academy voters gave Donald Crisp a break that year for How Green Was My Valley.The York family is played by Margaret Wycherly, June Lockhart and Dickie Moore as mother, brother, and sister. Wycherly is one you'll remember also. Hard to believe this is the same woman who is also James Cagney's Ma in White Heat. Come to think of it, maybe not, Ma York and Ma Jarrett are both tough survivors.As for the action that won him decorations from all the Allied powers including the Congressional Medal of Honor, you'll just have to see the film for that. But while some liberties are taken with York's pre-war story, what happened in the Argonne is actually what happened.We could use a whole lot more Sergeant Yorks, those with the using kind of religion.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmEzN2M4YjgtZmQ2MC00ZGI3LWEwNWEtNDRjNGE0N2FiMzQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Cue the music: ""Smile, Though Your Heart is Aching."" Enough already.Better Days needed a much better ending but that's my opinion. Instead, it becomes a conversation between the star and the viewing audience that breaks the rules of moviemaking in a good way, until the writer/director decides to betray that trust.As good as it seems to be when the main character is introduced to another man, there must be something better out there. Where have I heard that before in this ""What truly is happiness"" generation? Let the angst continue.But, why? The main character is a bright, apparently responsible woman with a good job, a formerly successful marriage and two adult children that care for her. Can't that be enough or is this movie a statement on coping with despair and finding some meaning for our perpetually troubled existence.

But Antonioni distinguishes himself here as a great artist of the medium by not only creating the kinds of compositions (lensed by Gianni De Venanzo, who worked with Antonioni on Il Grido and La Notte as well as the WW2 documentary Days of Glory and Fellini's 8 1/2) no one could ever justifiably imitate correctly, but creating a depth to the substance. On one hand one aspect of L'Eclisse that's appealing is how it balances out the style and substance (though the style is arguably the more distinguishable and greater than the two). On the other another aspect is that it could put off viewers not terribly familiar with Antonioni's psychology (which, like Scorsese for example, is at least consistent and engaging with the rest of the director's catalog of work). How intently he gets inside Vittoria's head, and at the same time maintains a detachment despite the varying emotional contexts, is extraordinary, if highly personal.Like Vittoria, Antonioni does something that's fascinating throughout the film - though one doesn't know what it is exactly that holds Vittoria, and for that matter Piero, in their respective attitudes, one doesn't feel quite left out of anything heart-stopping for the story/character's sake. The film lets us in just enough as to no keep us curious, and it also doesn't keep itself in a depressive tone, as it is realistic to how the people in this city exist. In fact, there's another facet to L'Eclisse which especially worked for me - the poetry that slips itself in small doses amid the visual sweep. Whether it be one of the long takes, an elongated view on a building or street-light, or on Vitty as Vittoria, it's in the observation that subtext forms. This is the kind of motion picture that a shot-by-shot analysis would serve like would a Picasso or Chagal.And as a plus to the film's success are the actors turns - Monica Vitti is the only actress from that period and country I can think of who could've pulled off what Antonioni wanted in Vittoria. Her face, after being in front of us minute after minute, becomes familiar despite her inner-angst. She knows what Vittoria's fears and loss of vitality means for the story. She's not a person without a laugh or smile ever, yet those emotions arrive only after the known mood is peeled away like a layer of skin. ""To love I think one shouldn't know the other,"" she says, almost arbitrarily. ""But then, maybe one shouldn't love at all."" Is this Antonioni hitting the hammer on the head, or is it just one of those kinds of comments a woman like her would make? As in L'Avventura, there is the mystery around the female lead. Is love beyond her reach we might wonder, or has the idea of it vanished under false pretense? Alain Deleon also deserves credit for his Piero, as he counters her quiet, more fogged demeanor as a stockbroker in Rome. That under current to the story - the major bustle and noise of the gamblers in the stockbroker's hall - is also part of the contrast, to the stretches with minimal dialog and sound.The last act, which regards Vittoria's relationship to Piero (a time after he empty break-up with her past lover Rodrigo) culminates in an astonishing feat of storytelling and film-art. As it becomes all the more evident neither one will arrive at a certain (usually) desolate cross-road corner to meet up, the idea of an eclipse over these people and places is hypnotic, unique. For its time it must've been quite a stroke by a director, and forty or so years later the whole sequence leaves its effect in due. Haunting formations beneath and surrounded by the sky and clouds, and it's a bit intellectually loaded. There can be any interpretation for this climax (or as one could claim an anti-climax) that isn't manipulated by Antonioni. The sequence, as with the rest of the film, asks only to see the world based on how one would think it can, or will, be seen. And it fits memorably, like bedroom slippers, into the prime of Antonioni's career as an auteur. Among the three films in Antonioni's films from this period of his career (1960-1962), this is the one I'd recommend the highest. The Eclipse is also the kind that's nearly mandatory to see more than once if sincerely interested in checking out at all (in other words, don't watch it with pre-conceived notions of this being a dramatic love story with solid conventions to it).","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTlmZjMxMzctMmE0MS00NmI1LTg5NTktNjc5ODY1ZDg3NmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTIyNzY1NzM@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The economy is bad and Jason Biggs plays a highly college educated man who can't get a job in his field. He can't wait any longer, because his out of work wife is having a baby, and they have no insurance for it, so he takes the first job that's offered to him: A job as a driver for a group of strippers.Jason Biggs was right for the role as the main protagonist. He brings a sweetness to the whole movie. His innocence is believable without being too melodramatic.I thought it was interesting that they did not bring up the strippers dark side to why they became strippers. Early on the movie explains it's about the money and it's good money and it's a job and nothing else, which is pretty much the prime basis of the movie is that everyone needs a job. It's not that the dark side of stripper would have added anything to the light comedy, it's just one clichÃÂ© they seem to have left out.I did like how the strippers were portrayed in the film. It's very new era, showing just how in control they are of the situation, which is how it should be and hope that the film statement of being semi-true is getting that accurate.Plus all the girls were sexy, especially Bria Murphy. can't help to cross my mind what Papa Eddie thinks of the film.Anyway, the story has the potential to leave a mark, but it's not a decent enough comedy. You'll watch it, have fun, and a minute later forget all about it.http://cinemagardens.com","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ2N2UzMDYtNDJlMi00YThmLWExYWEtMGQ0MWFiMjE0OWU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTgyNDk1OTY@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

So it's an easy guess that Emanuelle - Sinnliche Rache will want to follow a similar (and sexy) path.Surprisingly (to me at least), Emanuelle - Sinnliche Rache is a remake of Joe D'Amato's 1975 movie Emanuelle e FranÃÂ§oise (Le sorelline). Now even though I am admittedly a fan of Joe D'Amato's work, his movies are quite dated and are mostly known for the wrong reasons entirely.So what does Emanuelle - Sinnliche Rache get right? I knew very little about this movie beforehand, so it was nice to see this reinvention of a familiar plot.The actors/actresses are all good looking and there's plenty of topless nudity, albeit none of it excessive or prolonged. The story really does make the effort to be intriguing, which is great as I was worried this would simply dissolve into a senseless softcore affair.The first half of the movie does play out like a TV movie, but in a harmless and enjoyable way. It's the last act however that really changes the tone, becoming quite dark and mean. The act of revenge (and the catalyst for it) are handled emotionally well.Overall, this is quite a good recommendation for a date night movie if you're looking for something a little titillating but with a solid and interesting story to support it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTNmODQxNjMtMWMzMi00YjQ5LThmMGUtNDBmNGMxZTljNGU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTQwNzM4NzM@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Maybe it's the era bleeding through the screen into my brain, bringing me back to a time when cgi didn't exist and movies held their own magic without having super budgets spewed into them.  Maybe it's because Tom Baker, my all-time favourite Doctor, plays a rather scruffy-looking artist with a serious dark side.  Maybe it's the memorable soundtrack, oddly orchestral amid the tumult of intrusive moog soundtracks of the period.As mentioned in another review, get the UNCUT version if you can.

If there was to be one role that is to be returning to this plot, Hollywood would be the best one. I actually liked the chemistry between Jason Williamson and Lady Jesse more than Andrew McCarthy and Kim Catrall. This one was a much sweeter movie because it had sweeter parts. Like how they shared a slow dance in that club. That was one. How he took her in mannequin mode all over, even ate with her when she was that way. That combined with the song ""I Can't Believe My Eyes"", that rendition was the sweetest one I've ever heard.

As a source novel, Genet's 'Querelle' presents a challenge for any adaptation but as this is R.W. Fassbinder's final work, one is compelled to ignore one's initial (poor) response and dig for signs of the vision seen elsewhere in his cannon.This is a film that unrelentingly refuses to let the viewer in. Narrative is piled upon narrative which is further punctuated by Brechtian title cards containing quotes from a variety of sources (including, of course, Genet's novel). The high stylisation of setting and performance is deliberately off putting and distancing. In this world of almost exclusive homosexual desire, women are severely marginalised which leaves the great Jeanne Moreau with little to do other than warble a rather ridiculous (and ridiculously catchy) pop ditty that uses Oscar Wilde's 'Ballad of Reading Gaol' for lyrics. Here, choice of sexuality is symbolic for how one stands in opposition to social rules and true fulfilment and depth of being comes only in humility and, ultimately, humiliation. Of course, much of this overtly gay posturing can be seen simply as high camp and add an undeniable veneer of silliness which is, quite frankly, hard to shake off.However, this is a deeply serious film. Maybe Fassbinder was simply looking to upset as many people as he could and the whole point is to alienate the viewer as much as possible, either into anger or submission. It's hard to fully know what to make of 'Querelle' but either way, although stunningly lit, it has little of the swagger or movement of his best work and comes across as rather staid and inert. But, again, possibly that's the point. Confusion and denial as to individual identity leads to frustration and random acts of violence (if only to oneself) and self imploding inertia. It's hard to criticise a film that is deliberate about these points but, ultimately, it is equally hard to like and finding a place for it is no easy task. Possibly a work to admire and provoke rather than one to enjoy.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTI0ZmQ2ZGUtZTc0NS00MDI5LTljNDAtMzNlMzE2ZTcxMjM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Around 50% of the votes cast so far are 1 and this is understandable, as the subject matter in the movie is probably the darkest and most disturbing that any movie could possibly be- and to make matters worse, its all true. There is a relentless hate for this movie and people are going to vote 1 just to try to discourage other from seeing it, to try and teach Hollywood to stay out of producing tragic events, but where were the 1's for other movies profiting off tragedies, like Schindler's List, Titanic or Monster? Before seeing it, I read from others that the acting in the movie was great, I didn't take the comments seriously, but after seeing it, I am totally impressed with Laura Preppon's talent- I never thought of her as a good actor. She IS Karla Homolka, and although she won't win any Oscars for this role, she has undoubtedly impressed many other critics who may have never suspected she had this talent within her. The only major difference between Karla and Laura is that Homolka was a very small woman- 5'2 or so, while Laura is very tall, 5'11. When watching the introducing scene, I had doubts about how good Misha Collins would be, but by the time we reached the first perversion, he turns out to be quite a good actor, although I'd say Preppon definitely gives a better performance. People object to this movie for many reasons, and one is that some believe it's too sympathetic to Karla, but I would disagree. True, it is narrated from real life transcripts that Karla gave to her pscyhiatrist,and many see that as a reason to distrust the movie, but what she tells and what we see are sometimes different and the movie does NOT omit ANY of the evil deeds she committed. However, A LOT of the sadistic things that Paul did were omitted in this brief 81 minute movie- and that is why I called it a 'toned-down' version of the gruesome events, more toned-down that most people would suspect it would be. In this way, the violence is not gratuitous, but there are *surprise!* many cringe-inducing moments. One flaw I see in this movie is the improper allocation of time to various events. The movie covers 90% of the key events, but there was no mention of the videotapes being found, (which completely turned the case upside-down) nor was there any time giving us background information about Bernardo or Holmolka, which we see in other serial killer movies like Monster (we see Aileen as a teenager). I may be wrong, but I think the chronological order between various events may have been shuffled in one case, but probably for editing reasons. I doubt any reviews that IMDb can offer will make a difference in whether one sees it or not, as either you can tolerate watching difficult things or you cannot. However, I agree with CBC's review that is 'an above-average' movie and while being tough to watch, it can also be a tool to reinforce the message that appearances can be deceiving.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzNjU3OTAzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTcxMjIzMQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

But even he (and all of it's other big-name stars) could not save this poorly written, badly executed, gross, retarded-plot movie.A law student has a whacked out, bored best friend, a really nice but under-defined girlfriend, some sort of poorly outlined, difficult childhood past and then gets a job as a nightwatchman in a morgue to pay for school. (This involves checking to make sure that the bodies are okay each night.) The plot just gets worse from there.  I won't go into details, but realize that it's set in a morgue (just go with that image for a second), involves really icky mental disorders, hookers, bored twenty-somethings and a serial killer.Perhaps Nick Nolte's worst role EVER.  Ewan McGregor just looks embarrassed, as do Josh Brolin and Patricia Arquette.

It knows what we are expecting and then delivers something different.Technically, it's great -- well lit and clear sound. We spend most of the film with just our main three characters and the acting is uniformly excellent among all of them.

It makes for an enriching experience.So imagine my surprise when, coming here after watching this movie, I found out that not only there's not a single review about it, but also so few people have seen (the vote count as I'm writing is only at 177)! I mean, really? This is by no means a B movie (which usually have ten times as many ratings), and it's already been three days since it was released. For such a delightfully charming one, it's too much of an injustice, so here's my attempt to repair that a tiny bit.Watching the trailer you might be tricked into thinking this is a silly YA rom-com, and sure enought I begins that way. But it soon goes from silly to charming, from charming to heartbreaking... don't get me wrong, at its heart this is still very much a YA rom-com, with all of it's clichÃÂ©s and pitfalls, nothing groundbreaking. But the way it blend those with some more dense elements (one of them being almost too somber) feels so right that you can't help but be captured by it; I've mentioned The Fault in Our Stars at the beginning, but in this sense it's much more akin to Me and Earl and the Dying Girl.A lot of it goes to the impeccable production and cast. Both protagonists (Flynn and Telles) are so natural that they manage to somehow hoover above you're average in-love teen couple. The supporting characters are also on spot, including some hilarious ones having little to no lines at all. But what impressed me the most was the special care given to the cinematography, which leverages the movie concept to create some really eye-caching close-ups. All of this combined with a lot of funny references to '90s nerd culture. Considering that this is the first feature film of director Kellen Moore, it's even more impressive.Of all of those tragic-teen-romance movies that have become a genre in and of itself, this is the only one that I've actually enjoyed. Give it a try - even if you don't like it as much, I think you'll agree that it deserves a LOT more attention than it's getting.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTZhMWYzMWQtNmJkYi00YjE5LWJmNGUtZjE4ODdjZjYzMDVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0NTI0Nw@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

But his last scam backfired, leaving him indebted to a mob boss and his enforcer.","141","Formulaic but fun","There's this rule in Hollywood that may be unwritten but is nonetheless ironclad: stick to the formula. The hero can't die in a romantic comedy. The drama can't be too funny, and the comedy can't be too sad. Action flicks can't be too deep, and ""serious"" movies have to be somewhat boring.On the rare occasions when some movie comes along that breaks these rules, we usually get cinematic excellence. But with Confidence, don't be expecting any deviation from the format. Confidence is a fun, enjoyable, light caper movie. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. And for what it is, it's not half bad.Edward Burns plays a con man, Jake Vig. Together with his crew of seasoned, confident fellow con men, he scams people out of money. Lots of money. And of course, sooner or later he's bound to pick the wrong person to scam. In this case it's a seemingly innocuous accountant who just happens to work for a mob kingpin, cheesily called ""the King"" (but played brilliantly by Dustin Hoffman). In a tight spot, Jake agrees to do a con and split the proceeds with the King, to get him off his back. What follows is the usual series of crosses, double-crosses, and triple-crosses while everyone tries to figure out who to trust and who's about to screw who over.When I say that Confidence follows the rules, I mean it. Crime capers must have wise-talking characters. This does. Crime capers must be stylish. This is. Crime capers must have the token female, whose role is to be sexy but not too sexy. Rachel Weisz fills the part here, and does a decent job at it. (Other such token women included Julia Roberts in Ocean's Eleven, and Angela Bassett in The Score). Crime capers must make the audience scratch their heads trying to piece it all together, but must not make them think about any deeper moral issues of right and wrong. Again, Confidence lives up to that deal on both counts.Still, it was fun escapist entertainment. And, without giving away too much of the ending, let's just say that I'm always impressed with a movie that manages to surprise me. That alone makes it worth seeing.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGQ2OTc5OTgtZmU1My00OWRlLWJkMGEtNjMxY2E1NGE3Y2Q3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTIxMzMzMzE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Having had very little experience with actual filmmaking, he showed incredible potential with his debut and he took full advantage of it in years to come.  Here he explored a lot of the scenarios that would later charectarize his films.  With this film, and particularly his next, Dario showed he had been influenced quite a bit by the great Alfred Hitchcock.  The theme here; an american in a foreign country becomes a witness to a heinous crime and starts investigating himself; bears more than a little resemblance to many of Hitchcock's films.  An innocent man finds his morbid curiosity getting the better of him and as he progresses in his investigations he puts himself in grave danger.  The story unfolds in a similar way to Hitchcock's films, clues are gathered periodically and there's a surprise in the end which is hard to guess, but not impossible.  Argento gradually builds up the suspense and creates a genuinely intriguing mystery.  The film never slows down too much and it never fails to be interesting.  It's also got a surprising amount of laughs.  But in comparing Argento to Hitchcock, Argento manages to create a style of his own, which he would perfect in Profondo Rosso aka Deep Red a few years later.  That's of course the visual style.  Here he has the assistance of one Vittorio Storaro and the visual aspect of this film is one of it's greatest assets.  The film is wonderfully lit every single time and Argento switches effortlessly between dark and dreary visuals to shiny happy images.  Argento's visual style is one of his greatest trademarks and it bears some influence from the likes of Mario Bava.  I don't want to name any particular scenes, they all flow well together.  Another terrific Argento trademark is the music.  Ennio Morricone's score is nothing short of fantastic, ranges from cathcy repetetive melodies to haunting sounds of fear.  I think the impact from Argento's films would lessen considerably would it not be for those terrific scores he gets every time.  However, Argento is not perfect.  He seems to lessen his standards when it comes to the acting department.  Here, the characters are a bit wooden and he doesn't give them all that good lines to deliver.  The dialogue in many of his films seem a little childish.  And it doesn't look like he gives them many instructions, the acting here (and in most of his films) is shaky and not very consistent.  It has been said about Argento that he basically thinks of actors as human props, what's most important is where they are positioned and how they move.  Also, it's very annoying how he dubs every film, even the american actors have to do voice overs on themselves.  That said, Argento has more pro's than con's.  His films are always interesting and wonderful to look at.  The Bird with the Crystal Plumage is in my opinion one of his best. 9 out of 10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE1YjY3MDEtMTNkNy00ZGI1LWJlYmUtZTZjNTc5Y2YyZjk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

With 'Celebrity' it was not different and therefore it is a little disappointing. If another writer director would have made this film I think I would have liked it better. Maybe that is strange, to compare it with his other films simply happens.In 'Celebrity' we follow Kenneth Branagh who plays Woody Allen, although he is named Lee Simon. A movie without Woody Allen himself is nice, but with a character that basically is Allen, why not play it yourself? On the other hand, Branagh does a terrific job. We see how Branagh divorces his wife and after that we have single episodes of his life where he meets women, tries to make them his, fails or succeeds, only to enter the next episode. At the same time we follow his ex-wife, Robin (Judy Davis), who meets a new man Tony (Joe Mantegna) and does settle.Branagh is a writer. He writes a novel, has written two novels with bad reviews and now he finished a screenplay. In the episodes he tries to offer his script or new novel to people who can change it into a movie or book. We have Melanie Griffith and Leonardo DiCaprio as spoiled actors, Famke Janssen as a girl who really likes him and could help get his story into a book, Winona Ryder as the girl he has some real chemistry with and Charlize Theron as a supermodel.The problem is that every episode feels like an episode instead of everything combined as a movie. The Theron and DiCaprio episodes are great, the Winona Ryder episode is sweet, the others are pretty standard. The intercuts of the ex-wife's life are pretty good as well, but still feel as single episodes.Although the film as a whole is not that great there are enough moments to enjoy it. You will not be bored. The black and white photography looks terrific and that is something that makes the movie more pleasant. It is well acted and of course directed, but for a Woody Allen comedy it is not my first choice.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWY0ZjYyMTItNjNlMi00NWI5LTkzY2MtYTczNjcyNDMwMTJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDQzMDg4Nzk@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Not only is this a courtroom drama (and as you know the streets of Hollywood seem to be paved with this kind of scripts), it also featured Cher as one of the main actresses. I'm not really a fan of her as a singer, but seeing her as a good actress is even a lot harder. As you know, almost all pop diva's, young or old, seem to have that urge to appear in one or two movies and that almost always results in complete disasters. So why would Cher be any different...? When a judge commits suicide and his secretary is found murdered in a river, a homeless and deaf-mute man, named Carl Anderson, is arrested for her murder, because all indirect evidence points to him. Because he can't afford a lawyer, public defender Kathleen Riley is assigned by the court as his lawyer. Even though she doesn't always believes in his innocence, she still goes after the real killer. She gets help from the congressional adviser Eddie Sanger, who is called to be on the jury panel and together they find some important evidence that the murder has something to do with corruption in some high ranks...I must admit that Cher has done a better job than I ever expected from her. She actually was very convincing and interesting to watch as the public defender. Together with Liam Neeson she makes this movie work. Their nice performances and their difficult professional relationship in this movie are actually the best thing this movie has to offer. The story on itself certainly isn't that bad, but the plot is a bit far-fetched and gives this movie an ending that is a bit too abrupt.In the end this is a reasonably well-done courtroom drama / thriller that lacks the required tension to be fully satisfying, but which offers some nice acting and some good direction. It's not the best movie in the genre, but it is enjoyable enough to be worth a watch. I give it a 6.5/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzhiZDRjNDQtMmUxNi00MWJkLTk1ZjItMDE3ZTBjZWMwZThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

""Meteor"" is, admittedly, a flawed movie, but still one with many strengths that deserve attention.Firstly, it was made in 1979, so the effects are not going to be as stellar as they were in the 80's and 90's.  And even then, some of those effects still hold up quite well to movies produced today.  The modeling work, especially of the orbiting Hercules and Peter the Great nuclear missile platforms, is extremely impressive.  The meteor itself is a big, ugly, and rather scary chunk of scarred rock, reminiscent of the Texas-sized shard in ""Armageddon"".  Yes, some of the effects DO look cheesy (the avalanche being the most frequently cited example), but others are quite striking.  At worst, ""Meteor""'s effects are extremely uneven, but certainly not completely junkable.Secondly, unlike ""Deep Impact"" and ""Armageddon"", the film focuses on the multitude of hurdles that have to be overcome in order to combat the threat. Personal, politicial, and scientific obstacles are given due screentime, which serves to advance the story rather than bogging it down.Thirdly, ""Meteor"" is a far more globalized film, as it pulls together Russian, English, and even Chinese characters into the story.  The attempt to track the rock and derive a viable solution to knock it out of its Earth-based trajectory is not solely an American one, but instead a closely coordinated international effort.  Indeed, even the U.N. is (briefly) featured.Fourthly, the film doesn't get mired in the 'human element' (as what happened in ""Deep Impact"" and ""Pearl Harbor"").  ""Meteor"" is non-tangential in that it STICKS TO THE STORY, which is the main interest of the viewer (at least, for me).  Yes, there is the attraction between Connery and Wood's characters, but it's generally unobtrusive and the screentime limited.Fifth, Laurence Rosenthal's score is great!  Its boldness reminds me of Poledouris' legendary score for ""Conan:  The Barbarian"".  It effectively captures both the 'feel' of space and the direness and immediacy of the situations portrayed.Finally, I emjoyed the acting.  Connery, Keith, Malden, and Fonda turn in sincere performances (especially Malden).  ""Meteor"" is an ensemble production in the tradition of Irwin Allen's best disaster productions.Don't let the naysayers in here turn you off from this underrated gem.  If ""Deep Impact"" and ""Armageddon"" left you wanting, give ""Meteor"" a try. Sure, it may not be as polished as those two productions, but it has more going for it than you might think.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjc3YTdmMjYtMzIwOS00ZTkwLTg4NzktYjc1ZDRlNmYxMWMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc5NjEzNA@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It takes a certain kind of person to have a passion for a film but to see it for no more than it is. And it takes another who finds it necessary to look for too much in something...to take it too seriously. And that's fine I suppose - each to his own and all that. But hokum is still hokum. I like hokum...and it's nice to see that some other reviewers (such as ""Roderick"" and ""Wayne Malin"" get 'Dr Terror's House of Horrors' for what it is these days....Hokum...FUN. It's not horrific. It's hard to find much these days which can be classed as truly horrific or terrifying - real life supplies too much of that for our own good. But what have here is purely and simply fun.Personally, I find this movie is best enjoyed late at night ( a rainy night is ideal if one presents itself) with something nice to drink...and with the lights turned down low. The first time I saw 'Dr Terror' was very late one wintery friday night on BBC 1 many years ago and the time of night seems to suit so well that I wouldn't dream of changing it. As I said previously, it's not horrific but really, I could watch the likes of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee sitting in an open field reading aloud from the Edinburgh and Lothians phone book, so to see them in a creepy train carriage sparring over the merits of fortune tellers and ""the entire lunatic fringe"" is just a joy. As for the support - Neil McCallum, Roy Castle, Donald Sutherland, Peter Madden and Alan (and that's going to happen to me..?) Freeman - they all do well with the material provided. It's a touch spooky in a ""The Avengers""/""The Ghost Train"" type way. The direction by Freddie Francis is spot-on. The musical numbers are foot-tappin' groovy. I liked the score but I agree with the reviewer who picked up on the music not quite fitting a scene or fading (or indeed stopping dead) in the strangest places. This may have something to do with Elisabeth Lutyens being brought in as a late replacement for Tubby Hayes who was originally assigned to score the picture. No matter..as they say, it all adds to the charm.Good late night fun...there's that word again. It should get repeat fees on this page. And incidentally, for those who are used to the late night TV screenings or the washed out VHS, you might like to know that a DVD is available. It's Region 2 PAL and imported from Italy under the title ""Le Cinque Chiavi del Terrore"". It's a bit light on the extras save for a scratchy but rather cool Italian trailer. But its an ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN TRANSFER and a rather nice one at that...I don't think I'm allowed to say where it can be bought on this page but it shouldn't be too hard for you to find on the net...just think of somewhere Diabolik-al...ahem. But that's all by the by - full screen, widescreen... Whichever version is available to you, and at whatever time...watch 'Dr Terrors House of Horrors'...you'll have fun...a lot of fun...so go on, tap the cards three times...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFhYWQzODQtMDQ4Zi00MTYyLTljOTktMWRhN2UxMmNhMmE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc5NjEzNA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The suspenseful story, IMO often wrongfully compared to David Fincher's 'Se7en' because of its seemingly similar thematic elements, is set in the French Alps, in the fictitious towns of Guernon and Sarzac. The marvellous scenery contributes a lot to the overall mysterious atmosphere of the film and is an ideal background for the movie's convincing cast. This is especially true for the leading roles which are portrayed by two of the most talented French actors: Jean Reno and Vincent Cassel.The plot is based on a novel by Jean-Christophe Grange who, together with director Mathieu Kassovitz, also developed the screenplay. With the book being quite complicated due to its many carefully intertwined lines of action, a lot had to be simplified, altered or simply cut out, a well-known issue with adaptations. Unfortunately, many of the novel's explanatory scenes were omitted, so that ,you end up with a film which is not boring but quite confusing', as main actor Vincent Cassel puts it correctly. The following is a basic plot summary that intends to spoil as little of the story as possible:Commissaire Pierre Niemans is called to the remote university town of Guernon to solve a gruesome murder case in which the victim - the university's librarian - was brutally tortured and mutilated. Neither the university officials nor the students prove to be too helpful during the investigation and Niemans soon gets the impression that there is something very suspicious about the whole situation. Meanwhile, Commissaire Max Kerkerian investigates the desecration of a grave in Sarzac. Soon it turns out that the seemingly unrelated cases are strangely connected with each other and, after a second corpse is found, the two very unlike cops team up to discover a long kept secret. This knowledge eventually gets them into life-threatening situations, the most deadly of them marking the end of the movie, which is set on top of a huge, snow-covered glacier.The acting is simply excellent: Jean Reno portrays Niemans as a surly, reserved but brilliant professional with an attitude that often offends the people around him, even if he does not mean to. Vincent Cassel is Max Kerkerian, a quite lively character, sharp-witted but at times lacking self-control and totally unconventional in his methods (the book even mentions him being a former car-thief). The third leading role, Fanny Ferreira, a glaciologist working at the university and the one to find the first corpse, is portrayed by Nadia FarÃÂ©s. Her enigmatic character is more involved in the mystery than it seems.The action is greatly enhanced by the spectacular panoramic views and camera trails used for the location shooting, even though the opening scene, where the camera follows Niemans' car as it approaches the first crime scene, is obviously a rip-off of Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining'. One scene shows Niemans and Ferreira, the scientist, descending a glacier, a dangerous shot for which huge cranes had to be transported to the glacier in order to secure the actors. The wonderful score was composed by Bruno Coulais, who managed to provide each scene with the appropriate musical background.As stated before, major changes were necessary to transfer the complex novel onto the screen. The outcome was that many viewers felt puzzled by the movie's abrupt, confusing and seemingly illogical ending, as much is left out in the film where the book provides extensive background information. This is where the movie's biggest flaw lies. Other alterations include the renaming of Karim Abdouf (novel) to Max Kerkerian (film). While his characteristics remained more or less the same, it was the author's original intention to include a police officer of Algerian origin in the story. The characters in general are darker in the novel where Niemans even kills a hooligan before the actual story begins. The conspiracy revealed by the cops is larger and was also one of the aspects which were simplified for the movie.All in all, one could complain that some of the action scenes look rather out of place, like Kerkerian's fight with two skinheads or the obligatory car chase later on in the film. The 'mismatched-cop scenario' is not too innovative either, but since it is depicted in such a unique way, it would be unfair to dismiss it as a clichÃÂ©. While I can only reiterate that it may be difficult to completely grasp the movie at once, it is not at all impossible to follow the storyline as some have claimed. ,The Crimson Rivers' is definitely a great movie in its genre, featuring spectacular camera shots and an excellent cast and is in this vein well worth a visit.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGNmMDgxZTItYjNkNy00NDlhLTk2ZmItM2UwNDcwYzhmNDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk1Njg5NTA@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Twice","I just thought I would get that confession out of the way and into the open. Yes, I went to see this in theaters twice when I was 11 years old. I could list to you the excuses I have, such as the fact that my parents paid for my ticket, and there were only six theaters in my local multiplex at the time, and I had already seen ""Forrest Gump"". I could go on. The truth is that when I first saw a matinÃÂ©e showing of this film with a friend, neither of us thought it was a bad movie. Then I went to see another matinÃÂ©e showing a few days later on a rainy day with my brother and a babysitter, and they both hated the film. Not disliked, mind you, but hated it. They weren't the only ones. In the sixteen years since the film's release, I have heard nothing but bad things about it. It was released on VHS once, never on DVD, and Roger Ebert's review (""I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it"") is now more famous than the movie itself.As a kid, I knew ""North"" wasn't a perfect film. In fact, its major flaw was (and still is) the major cop-out (and frankly lazy) ending that I won't give away. However, I thought it was enjoyable enough, it had a creative (but highly unrealistic) premise, and I liked (and still like) Elijah Wood. Before seeing the movie again after so many years, I wonder what I missed about it in the first place that other people didn't. After seeing it as a 27 year old, I wonder how I could have missed these things to begin with.I think what disappointed people the most about this movie was the fact that it had an all-star cast, a likable lead, an accomplished director (Rob Reiner) who had not directed a bad film before this one, and was based on a book written by Alan Zweibel, one of the original Saturday Night Live writers (who also wrote the screenplay). I haven't read that book, but the idea of a child leaving his parents is more sad than funny.Wood plays a child named North who is a stellar student, athlete, and actor, yet he is worried that his parents don't pay enough attention to him simply because they ignore him while arguing one night at the dinner table. His successful legal divorce from his parents causes a contrived media circus resulting in kids having control over their parents. Such a revolution is spearheaded by North's acquaintance Winchell (Matthew McCurley), a journalist for his school's newspaper who reminded me then of Stuart Minkus from ""Boy Meets World"" but now reminds me of Dick Cheney. In an even more contrived circumstance, Winchell becomes head of a major corporation, and plots to kill North when he decides to return to his original parents.Throughout the film, North goes around the world searching for better parents. He stays with various sets of adoptive parents. They include a couple in Texas (Dan Aykroyd and Reba McEntire) who dress like cowboys you find at the Ice Capades, Alaskans (Graham Greene and Kathy Bates) who send their elderly father (Abe Vigoda) out to sea to die in an archaic ritual that hasn't been practiced in 150 years, and Hawaiian parents who are all too eager to show North's rear end on a highway billboard. It makes me sick writing about these jokes, so you can imagine what it's like to watch it.Seeing this as a kid, I never took these plot points seriously, perhaps because I never thought about divorcing my parents. Seeing it again as an adult, here's what I missed that was so bad about the movie: the awful ethnic stereotyping that came in the form of tasteless one-liners and myopic character depictions. The worst came in the form of Kathy Bates putting on a blackface equivalent to play an Eskimo. I cringe now at the terrible joke made by the Hawaiian Governor Ho (Keone Young) about his wife (Lauren Tom) and her inability to procreate: ""Hawaii is a lush and fertile land. In fact, there is only one barren spot on all of our islands. Unfortunately, it's Mrs. Ho."". If I were Mrs. Ho, I would have kicked him in the balls.We've all done foolish things as children. My foolish thing was the 12 dollars that went to waste from seeing this movie twice (although they were both matinees, so I saved some money). The important thing is that I know better now, and I reviewed this film recently before writing this review. This rule should apply to every amateur critic on this site: the way you remember movies you saw years ago is not the same as the way these movies actually are.Siskel & Ebert declared ""North"" the worst movie of 1994, and looking back, their reasoning was good. Is it the worst movie I've ever seen? No. Worse movies came out in 1994 (""It's Pat: The Movie"" and ""Exit To Eden"" come especially to mind), and any movie written or directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer make ""North"" look like ""Citizen Kane"", and I doubt Ebert would disagree. However, there's no question that there's only one barren spot in Rob Reiner's directing career. Unfortunately, it's this movie.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzBmYjZmNmEtZDQzMy00MGM2LWIxMDctYWRiOTJiN2ExZDVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUyOTc1NDYz._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

From some sources, we got the information that the movie we were about to see could be Adrift - Open Water 2. Having taking a look at the IMDb score it had received, we were basically hoping the information we got was incorrect and we'd see something nice like Fearless instead.But no. It was, in fact, Open Water 2. And boy, was it bad. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot is known, I'm not getting into that. Let's get to what's good about this movie. OK. That was the good part about the movie. Now let's get to what was bad.First, this movie lacks depth, character growth and pacing. It would have already been much better, had these things been present in the movie. But they are not. On the contrary, it's almost as if the director wanted to make the worst movie of the year. Scenes are drawn out like you wouldn't believe. Sometimes the movie goes into slow motion. Taking into account the awful pace of this flick, it's as if the movie just comes to complete halts at these points. It's like you're watching a computer game at 10 frames per second. The characters are ridiculous and make the worst decisions one could make. Leaving the boat without having a way to get back on it? OK, that's stupid but not a bad or unbelievable way to start a movie per sÃÂ©. It's the way the characters go about the things they do and the awful dialogues are presented to the viewer that makes this movie horrific. Especially look out for things like ""We need to get him to a hospital as soon as possible!"" and the prayer the stereotype dumb blonde chick says. It's just... so dead wrong. It's the way the annoying baby is constantly screaming while the point has long been made. It's the way they lose what little equipment they have. So incredibly silly and foolish you wouldn't believe. What furthermore kills this movie, is how the characters aren't interesting. They are boring, and some are downright annoying. The way they deal with the situation they're in, just has to be a joke. Also, the way they are supposed to struggle with the water and the fact of being lost is totally, well, lost on the viewer. The director tried to make this work by having the idiots say stuff like ""Ooah I can't feel my legs anymore"" and ... Well that's basically all the director uses to compensate for lack of involvement and drama. Just ""Ooah, I can't feel my legs/feet/arms/(insert whatever suits you)"". And then, the camera zooms out. Shot of the boat. The camera zooms in. ""Oah, I can't feel my legs anymore"". The camera zooms out. Minutes later. The camera zooms in again. ""This is all your fault"" - some guy dies in some kind of silly way. Camera zooms out again. And in. Etc.Damn what a bad movie. It's not even fun to watch how bad it is. Good horror B movies are fun for the crappiness factor. This movie is just a 100% piece of junk.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDRkZjBmZDAtYmQ5Zi00MWQ3LWE3N2ItM2YwNTI4ZTQ5OWNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

And it's not a matter of one knowing one's limitations; rather it is a matter of knowing how to cope with the results, once one has been driven past the breaking point into a world that can no longer be viewed in black and white, but only in shades of gray-- that point beyond right or wrong or what is politically correct; the point at which nothing matters but survival-- how to live in a world that can have so much to offer, while being so relentlessly unmerciful and decidedly unforgiving at the same time.Transplanted from the big city to a farm in Wisconsin, Alice and Howard Goodwin (Sigourney Weaver, David Strathairn) are attempting to make a go of their own dairy business.  But it isn't easy.  Howard is immersed in his work, while Alice, in addition to taking on the full time responsibilities and pressures of raising their two daughters and maintaining the household, also works as a school nurse.  And though Alice likes her life, the constant strain of keeping her own life on task, as well as seemingly everyone else within her sphere of existence, begins to take a toll on her.With no respite from the daily grind, Alice becomes increasingly exhausted and exasperated.  She finds some solace in her close friend, Theresa Collins (Julianne Moore), but what she really needs is some time to herself; some time to clear her head and regroup.  Instead, an unexpected summer tragedy strikes the Goodwin and Collins households, which damages Alice's much needed relationship with Theresa.  And as if that isn't enough, further trials and tribulations are about to descend upon Alice-- one of those curves life has a way of throwing at you when it's least expected, or needed.  And it's something that will test the limits of Alice's capacity to endure, more than ever before.Working from a remarkably insightful screenplay by Peter Hedges and Polly Platt (adapted from the novel by Jane Hamilton), director Elliott presents a genuinely honest film that takes an in-depth look at what it often takes just to `maintain' on a daily basis, and the very real issues and situations that a person like Alice is apt to encounter.  From the very beginning, Elliott establishes the credibility of the film by creating an atmosphere and setting that is entirely real-- so real, in fact, it will be more than a bit disconcerting to many who will so readily be able to identify with Alice and relate to her situation.  And, having effected such realism, Elliott then moves on to deliver a thoroughly engrossing, emotional drama, which he renders with great care and sensitivity.Elliott achieves success with this film through an obviously keen understanding of the material, the story, and the characters and their corresponding attitudes and reactions to given situations.  And he keeps it `real' throughout by eschewing any superfluous melodrama or sub-plots, the likes to which a film like this in lesser hands could easily lend itself. In the final analysis, Elliott knows what he wants to convey, and furthermore, knows how to do it by exacting the kind of performances from his actors that really sells it.As often happens (too often, in fact), the extraordinary performances in this film were inexplicably overlooked (as well as the film itself) and/or ignored.  Sigourney Weaver gives a commanding performance as Alice, arguably as affecting and effective as the work that earned Hillary Swank the Oscar this year for her portrayal of Brandon Teena in `Boys Don't Cry.'  This is quite simply some of the best work Weaver has ever done, and it's a shame that she has not enjoyed the kind of acclaim that would accompany such an accomplishment in a perfect world.  Which adds some irony to the whole thing, inasmuch as part of what this film is attempting to convey (and does so, successfully) is that we do not, in fact, live in a perfect world. All that aside, this is a memorable portrayal, in which Weaver exhibits a phenomenal depth and range of emotion.The field was strong in the Supporting Actress category this year (Angelina Jolie received the gold for `Girl Interrupted'), but Julianne Moore's performance here stands alongside any of those honored with a nomination for their work.  Like Weaver, Moore faced the challenge of creating a character that is so mainstream and `normal'-- one of those everybody's neighbor or the-clerk-at-the-store type of roles-- that the real difficulty lay in making it look so natural, which when successfully effected, makes it all look so `easy.'  Which is exactly what Moore did with her portrayal of Theresa.  And-- again, like Weaver-- it's a performance for which she has never received the deserved acknowledgement.  Suffice to say, it's terrific work, and a big part of what makes this film so emotionally stirring.Also effective is David Strathairn as Alice's self-absorbed husband, Howard, a man suffering from a terminal case of tunnel vision.  How good he is here, in fact, can be measured by the feelings of disdain he manages to evoke toward his character, which at times, is quite substantial.The supporting cast includes Arliss Howard (Reverdy), Louise Fletcher (Nellie), Sara Rue (Debbie) Nicole Parker (Sherry) and Aunjanue Ellis (Dyshett).  An ardently thought provoking film, `A Map of the World' invites a sense of introspection and reflection; a film that's definitely going to make you do some thinking.  9/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg1Y2FkZjUtNWUyZC00MjVjLThjNjItOTE1NWExOWJmNjU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjgyNjk3MzE@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

But when people involved bring their personal problems into the equation, it becomes dangerous - perhaps deadly.","81","About exploring experience, life, love, even death, from the point of view of others.","Everyone knows this was Natalie Wood's last film, and that some of her scenes were filmed after her death with a stand-in you only see from behind. Director Donald Trumball, best known for his special effects work in Blade Runner, Close Enounters, and Star Trek, chose this time to build his story on plot and character development, a good choice given the enormous talent he had to work with. Trumball's battle with studio execs to finish the film after Wood's death, rather than claim the insurance proceeds and call the film off, ended his career in Hollywood, but assured that this gem would not be lost. It is somewhat ironic that Natalie's swan song should be a sci-fi movie, since she was hardly known for work in the genre, but she brings a grace and charm, as well as depth and beauty, to the genre that is usually lacking.Most sci-fi films based on technology don't age well, and there are times where this is no exception. The idea of recording on tape, let alone making tape loops, must seem like wax cylinder recordings to today's MP3 generation. The tapes themselves were props borrowed from a film being shot nearby, and that film was itself a dismal failure. But the concept is timeless, and so well done that, all in all, the film still works as well as it did in 1983.Lesser screenplays would have been content with the main story line; scientists invent a way to record brainwaves and play them back for a real life out of body experience, and for just such a stinker, check out Strange Days. But then along comes the incomparable, utterly fabulous Louise Fletcher, who, as one of the co-inventors of the aforementioned device, records her death when she suffers a heart attack while working late one night. For the rest of the film, people are either trying to play the tape or prevent others from playing it. Meanwhile, the technology gets hijacked by two-dimensional government lackeys trying to exploit the weapons potential of the invention.One can easily pick out scenes of this movie to vilify or exalt, all these years later, and any object viewed over time eventually has a vanishing point. The almost slapstick scene where the assembly robots go berserk is one example of a scene that, while consistent with its contemporaries, is silly today. The death scene, though much maligned, is equally misunderstood, and provides the metaphysical underpinnings that elevate Brainstorm above mere gadget flicks. Brainstorm is about exploring experience, life, love, even death, from the point of view of others, and Academy Award winner Louise Fletcher allows us to do so through her consummate skill in presenting a death scene of sufficient awe and wonder to warrant exploration.If you want to find out what else happens, watch the film, but when you do, don't ignore the beautiful, delicate interplay between Christopher Walken and Natalie Wood. Their careening relationship seems somehow tied to the invention they helped make, and there are sequences so beautiful that I sometimes take out the DVD just to marvel at them.Despite changing styles in special effects, this is a timeless and beautiful story that transcends the genre and, with Walken, Wood and Fletcher, becomes more than just a story about shiny gold tapes that record brain waves. It's more about immovable objects and irresistible forces and what happens when they collide. Intrigued? Good. Go watch it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTg5OTNlOTEtMjFhZC00NWRiLWJlOWQtZTNiNDk3OGIxYmMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In the last decade Miike has gone from straight to video crime thrillers to genre-busting arthouse cult favourites by following his own unique vision. He's also breathtakingly prolific, having completed around twenty projects since this, which was released only three years ago(!) Miike's best known movies in the last few years include the ultra-violent live action manga 'Ichi The Killer', the slow psychological thriller 'Audition', and the zany, feel good zombie musical 'The Happiness Of The Katakuris'. Those three movies alone prove he is the most exciting and innovative director working today, but 'Visitor Q' takes him to a whole new level. 'Pink Flamingos' meets 'Salo' meets reality TV on crack(?) However you try and describe this movie it just won't be adequate. When I say you just have to see it to believe it, I'm not just taking in cliches! 'Visitor Q' is shot on digital video in a pseudo-documentary style. In the opening scene we see a middle aged man (Kenicho Endo, who you might recognize from Miike's 'Dead Or Alive 2') inadvertently videotaping himself having sex with a teenage prostitute. They are in fact father and daughter. This is just the beginning of a very strange trip for the viewer! The father is a failed TV reporter who comes up with a new program idea about bullying using his own teenage son (Jun Muto), who is being victimized by his classmates and in turn abuses his own mother (Shungiku Uchida). She is secretly addicted to heroin and turns tricks to support her habit. Into this ultra-dysfunctional family comes a mysterious visitor (Kazushi Watanabe) who we are introduced to when we see him brain the father with a rock. Exactly who or what the visitor is is never explained, but his presence effects the family in various odd ways, strangely bringing them closer together.  His character reminded me a bit of the messiah figures in Coffin Joe's 'Finis Hominis' or J.G. Ballard's 'The Unlimited Dream Company'. 'Visitor Q' slowly creeps up on you with images of abuse and abnormal behavior until around the three quarter mark when you are left staring slack jawed at the screen not quite believing what you are seeing! When the movie cuts between Father in the greenhouse and Mother in the kitchen with Visitor Q (I won't/can't go into details!) it's the most extraordinary sequence I've watched in any movie EVER! It goes with saying that 'Visitor Q' is not for most people, but if you appreciate the surreal and the confrontational, then this is one movie you MUST see. I think in decades to come it will regarded as a milestone and spoken of in the same breath as Bunuel, Jodorowsky, Lynch and Cronenberg.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwOWMyYjEtN2ZiZC00NjI4LWJlNGItOTU4ZWI1ZWJiMzdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The movie is awful.Having a popular star like Patricia Heaton in this movie is not enough to save it. The mothers and fathers depicted in this movie are mostly idiots and should never have had children. The script wouldn't have been approved for an ABC afternoon special because it's so poor.My wife and I went to see the movie because the 17 user reviews available at the time on IMDb gave the movie an 8 or above with accolades like: ""Love this movie,"" ""Perfect Mother's Day Fun,"" ""Funniest movie I have seen in a long time,"" and ""Greatest Movie Ever Made.""

Having seen the movie, it's clear to me that the reviewers had an ulterior motive.My history teacher in college, when announcing the next test date, would always preface his remarks with ""I know a word to the wise is foolish."" This was generally aimed at those who would put off studying for the test until the last minute. Well, being foolish, I would like to offer a word to the wise which I failed to follow when considering this movie. For movies you are unsure you would like, don't trust a very positive or very negative review on IMDb unless you at least scan all of that user's reviews. This will give you an idea where the user is coming from; if his/her tastes agree with yours; and whether there are any ulterior motives in posting the review. If a film has been absolutely panned on Metacritic, like this one was, be careful about selecting to go to that movie in the theaters. IMDb is generally a good source of what the users say. The operative word is ""generally."" In this instance it was not.My review was a warning that this movie is not worth seeing. The fact that only 2 of 13 users so far found this warning helpful offers another clue about how IMDb reviewers can have an agenda. Who were the 11 people who found that my warning was not helpful? Are they the same people who find stop signs annoying or could they possibly be the same people who wrote the overwhelming positive reviews of this movie.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMzgwMDM4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk4NjcyMTE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I laughed much harder than the aforementioned sequels. And the film, like the first, does not take itself seriously, it knows the first is a cult classic and they don't try to out shine it, they just are as they are. One should not come to such a film thinking they will experience emotional, introspective, and thought provoking cinema, this is a silly old fun time that had me laughing several times, a long with everyone else in the theater,And as far as it goes as a sequel to such a cult classic, they honestly could have done infinitely worse knowing how some reboots/sequels have turned out. Like I said before it doesn't try to outshine the first, but rather play on the things that made the first one so great. Its stupid, but fun. And without giving too much away, there are more than one joke relating to the original that fans such as myself will enjoy seeing. So no, it had no beautiful cinematography, had no introspective character development, and had no greater message, but honestly, who gives a s***, it a fun and stupid movie that I enjoyed because I knew this film was intended to not be taken seriously, its a comedy for crying out loud.

You know, like the most of Syfy made-for-TV creature features. But this one doesn't deserve all the rage. Yes, the dialogues are pretty basic and bland but it doesn't kill the creepy vibe going throughout the whole film length. The acting is decent - Ema Horvath is good as an estranged daughter and Mena Suvari finally stars in a horror movie that is not a garbage (although it's still hard to forgive her for ""Carrie 2"" and ""Don't Blink"").The best part of the movie is its visuals and lore. Lovecraft-esque fear of chtonic entities, hypnotic enigmatic lights coming out of nowhere and minimalistic synth soundtrack are making ""What Lies Below"" a thrilling eye-candy which is pretty much enough for a one-off horror movie. It doesn't reinvent the genre or offers any real plot twist (I mean, we all know John is going to be a bad guy, and Trey Tucker's effective performance convinces us right after we see him) but definitely worth a watch for its atmosphere and its actors that probably did even better that the script could offer them.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGQ4ZWM4NjctZDcwMS00OTJjLTljNmUtYWY4ODU3MjlkOGViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODk4OTc3MTY@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The latter accusation is partly correct, and thank goodness for it.  War and Peace, the novel, has many great things, but also many excrescences: it goes on way too long, padded out with tediously detailed philosophies and theories of war; it also studiously refuses loose ends.There are flaws.  The script, though a model of clarity (unlike most literary adaptations, which concentrate on all the big set-pieces, creating narrative confusion), but short on inspiration.  There is a dispiriting, unimaginative reliance on voiceover, and unnecessary soliloquys.  The whole thing also goes on way too long.Mel Ferrer is, without doubt, the worst actor in the world; he plays the dashing, tragic Prince Andrei with all the vigour of a mouldy plank.  His part is pivotal, narratively, thematically and symbolically, so he features in a lot of scenes where his monotonous lack of expression makes the film stop dead.  Henry Fonda, in many ways ideal as the Tolstoy altar-ego Pierre, who must move morally from observer to actor, is frequently defeated by the terrible dialogue, making this wonderful actor seem clumsy and amateurish. (Herbert Lom, however, manages to suggest great humanity behind the hammy pomp of Napolean).I only mention these faults to show that the film's critics have their point.  I also suggest that WAR AND PEACE is nearly a masterpiece for two reasons.  King Vidor, whose work I'm largely (and shamefully) unfamiliar with, directs this film with awesome, authoritive lightness of touch.  He pays respectful lip service to the big Tolstoyan themes, focusing particularly on families, the relations between parents and children, old traditional reactionary Russia, and the tentative, youthful impulse towards freedom.I say lip-service, because his main interest in the film lies elsewhere. It lies in the expression of the emotional life of his characters.  For although the film is a massive historical epic, it works best as a domestic melodrama.  Characters, who can't express themselves in this hierarchical society, are allowed a voice through the film's direction, which forsakes literal realism, to tell us what is going on in their heads (and  hearts). Exaggerated colour and carefully contrived composition offer us a second, more subtle and personal story, to the main, surface narrative.  This might make WAR AND PEACE a more right-wing work, ignoring the processes of history and the plight of the serfs, in favour of sympathising with a caste of slave-owners, but Hollywood was never very good at socio-economic analyses.Vidor's other great theme seems to be nature, and man's relation to it. He has little interest in invoking a real nineteenth century Russia; his Moscow is as exquisitely artificial as Sternberg's THE SCARLET EMPRESS, and his use of architecture and space to both show the distances between people, and the the fathomless emptiness of the soul, is positively Antonionian.  With the natural world, however, there is a real feeling, beyond mere backdrop scenery, that is unthinkable in any contemporary Hollywood film. Primarily a movie about people and history, it is eternal nature that watches on, the battles, deaths, retreats.  Indeed, it is nature that saves the Russian people, in the face of massive military odds, and it is nature that frames the melancholy, yet hopeful, resolution.  (It's also interesting to ask why, at the heighth of the Cold War, Hollywood should decide to make a great Russian epic?  To tastelessly evoke a 'glorious' pre-Soviet past?  Or to enjoy the razing of Moscow to the ground?)The second reason to love this film is, of course, the incomparable, beautiful, Audrey Hepburn.  She is so right as Natasha (when I read the book as a kid, I pictured Audrey all the way through, without even knowing she had played her on film), the saviour of the book, as well as the  film. It is one of the great performances - its modernity and truth blows away the dusty period conventions (indeed, at her first ball, she is as moving as a 50s teenager at her prom).  Her intelligence, insight, passion (and she is a lot more erotic in this film than her supporters ever give her credit for) and grace are perfectly in tune with Vidor's conception, and her scenes have an extraordinary emotional force.  She is the life of the  film, and its moral centre in the absence of a convincing Pierre.  The film plods to a slow death without her.  The film essays three moral developments - Natasha's, Pierre's and Andrei's, but hers is the most moving and tragic. The change to sadness and understanding of the once gay and vivacious Natasha seems a terrible loss.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmJjOThlYTYtYzFlZC00NjI1LWFhNzItYmIzNzk5NDZkZmRmL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's a remake, it involves a child in peril, and it contains some (and I say ""some"") very nasty violence. Just watch--you'll have trouble hating it.Guillermo del Toro's new collaborative effort with first-time director Troy Nixey is, simply put, horror done right. There's a lot here that can be found in any horror movie that comes out now, but this one succeeds for relying on tone and setting rather than blood and guts. The acting from all three leads is surprisingly good, and Nixey shines as well behind the camera.However, at the heart of the film is a ballsy story co-written by del Toro that really keeps the film stable. Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is originally based on a 1973 British TV movie that has been hailed as one of the scariest movies ever made. The remake features a new main character: Sally, a child, played by Bailee Madison. Sally moves into a new Gothic mansion with her father (Guy Pearce) and a new stepmother (Katie Holmes). There, she discovers a ventilation system where she hears breathy voices calling to play with her. At first, the voices are friendly. Then, they're vicious and violent.The violence of the movie is one of the reasons why this movie succeeds so nicely. The first scene is grisly and is, without a doubt, the reason why Don't Be Afraid of the Dark earned its R-rating rather than its intended PG-13. There isn't constant violence. In fact, there isn't even that much of it. Most of it is bloodless, but all of it is enough to make us squeamish and afraid.Another area in which the movie excels in that respect is its design. The mansion that Nixey and del Toro chose is gorgeous. The intense lighting, which Nixey noted as ""inspired by Rembrandt"" in the Q&A following the film, is moody and adds to the heavy tone of the movie. The house is just creepy on its own, but it becomes creepier thanks to the creature design. Unlike what the trailer tells you, the creatures are pretty tiny. What creeped me out about them was the loud, shrill screeches they let out. It'll give you chills. Keep a keen ear and listen for del Toro, as he voices a few of the creatures.Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is a very fun and very creepy horror movie experience. Though not without its flaws, it has a strong story stabilized by good characters and a surprisingly dark ending, and it's got some good acting too. It's hard not to be absorbed in the mesmerizing light pools of the mansion, and it's even harder not to be entertained. As usual in del Toro films, darkness and unseen monsters reign, and as usual, it's pretty damn unnerving.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMDk4ODU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY2NDE0Ng@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

While the movie can't hide the trademarks of its generation and it is definitely not very original, it offers some new twists to traditional clichÃÂ©s of the genre and a higher quality than the rest of the slashers of its time. Also, it is fair to point out that the movie we know as ""Cherry Falls"" is not what its director, Geoffrey Wright, conceived originally. It suffered several cuts to attain an R-Rating losing most of its planned edginess.The story is set in the small town of Cherry Falls, where suddenly, a mysterious figure begins to kill the virgins in town. Sheriff Brent Marken (Michael Biehn) is specially concerned about the case not only because he knows that his beloved daughter Jody (Brittany Murphy) is virgin, but also because the case brings back memories of a dark event in Cherry Falls past. Meanwhile, the local teenagers organize a huge party to have sex and stop being potential victims.Written by Ken Selden, the story mixes dark comedy with the horror genre pretty much in the vein of Scream, using a clever twist to the genre clichÃÂ© of the virginal survivors. The mystery of the killer's identity is very well handled and the story unfolds as Jody's investigation takes her to discover the town's past. Surprisingly, the movie never gets boring or tedious, and it serve sits purpose as a thrilling mystery/horror film.However, the film promises too much and there is never a proper payoff. Director Wright conceived his film as a comedy/horror about sex and violence in the genre, but the severe cuts the movie received took away all the sex and violence the director intended to portray, leaving an incomplete product that is really unsatisfying. This severely hurts the film, particularly at the finale, which is sad because it is really a very well crafted set-piece of nudity and violence that is badly edited to please the prudish MPAA.Geoffrey Wright follows a subtle style for the most part of the film, and according to the script, it was done that way because the killings were supposed to be gory. Again, with the edition of this it left the film incomplete with scenes that build up very good suspense without a payoff. The suspense is broken with badly edited cuts that lead to the belief that a lot was missing.The main cast is very good, particularly Jay Mohr as a concerned teacher who is truly worried about his students. Brittany Murphy is very good in the lead role is quite believable as a common teen girl (something not all slashers can say). The rest of the cast do a very good job but nothing really outstanding outside the leads.""Cherry Falls"" is a sad testimony of what further edition to a completed job can do. It certainly turned a promising great movie into an slightly above average horror film. Hopefully, a Director's Cut will be available someday but by now, ""Cherry Falls"" remains as a movie that could had been a lot better if it had remained true to its director's vision. 6/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGU4YzA1NGEtYmVhMy00ZGMwLThhY2YtNTUyN2RhNWNkNzI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Set in World War II Europe, a professor is changed by a cataclysmic event and explores the mysteries of life.","61","Searching the eternal youth in Romania","It's been a while since I have written anything for IMDb. ""Youth Without Youth"" is not only a very personal approach to a barely known novella by Mircea Eliade, but also a homage to Romanian culture and civilization. I felt really good watching a legendary filmmaker like Coppola before the special screening (in Bucharest), walking on the stage and thanking sincerely to the Romanian cast and crew, and in the end, thanking all of us ""for Mircea Eliade"". I read Eliade's novella some months ago, and I found it difficult and ""anti-cinematic"", unlike ""La tiganci"" or other texts of his. ""Youth"" is, as I saw it, a meditation on time and the relation between human memory and identity. Eliade has been concerned with the theme of ""la vita est sueno"" (life is dream) for a long time, and his fiction shows it. Coppola also has been preoccupied with time, dreams and memory in his late films like ""Peggy Sue"", ""Dracula"" and ""Jack"". It might seem strange and paradoxical, but beyond the horror clichÃÂ©s and the gory make-ups, one can see lots of formal similarities in ""Dracula"" and ""Youth..."". The Italian American director is definitely bound to European Romanticism, and he tried to infuse a lot of new symbols (the mirror, the moon on the bluish night sky, the skull etc) to an already symbol-heavy-loaded narrative. Tim Roth is the ideal choice for the central character (old Dominic Matei that grows young after a lightning stroke). The rest of the numerous cast is composed mainly of Romanian actors, most of which are famous in our country. Iures is known for the international public also, and handles his role elegantly, as usual. Maria Lara is a Romanian-born German actress, playing the role of Dominic Matei's lady friend and lover. The relationship between Dominic and Laura is beautifully developed by Coppola's rewriting of the initial novella. Near the end of the film, there is a moment (shot in Malta) where Dominic decides to break away from Laura, because of the dreadful effects of his supernatural youth on her physical condition. Both actors are impressive in this delicate scene.This film was, all in all, a pleasant surprise for me. I was expecting a more Hollywood-ish speculative and commercial-oriented style. Anyway, I personally (still) think the D.P. and the photographic department in general was overwhelmed by the magnitude of this project. Coppola should of thought more deeply about his choice, because Mihai Malaimare Jr. (the D.P.) and digital imagery was simply not enough ! It took over 2 years to complete this film anyway, so why didn't he use film instead of digital mediums? Was money really a problem here? Maybe Roth asked for a big fee, I don't know. This film won't be appreciated by a wide audience, because Eliade's literature is very special and restrictive (you need to fancy Romanian folklore and oriental philosophies in order to get into this). In fact, Eliade's novella was clearly inspired (as the main title shows) by one of the most beautiful and profound fairy-tales ever: ""Tinerete fara batranete si viata fara de moarte"" (hard to translate into English, but it might sound like ""Eternal youth and life without death""). Even if you are not Romanian, you should check it out! It will change the way you feel about time and life, the way Eliade changed Coppola from an old mainstream Hollywood director into an arty European film experimenter.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU0Yjg5NWQtMmVjMy00YTk3LWJlMGMtNGJlMDAyYjMyODViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I had never heard of the film and I had my reservations about it. Just from looking at the box I knew the film was an Indie film and therefore the quality was going to be less than a mainstream film. I can tell you that after I finished watching Zero Day I immediately started it from the beginning again. The film was clearly following the basic outline of what happened at Columbine High School of April of 1999, but what struck me was how believable the two lead actors were. My first time through watching this film I wasn't entirely sure if what I was watching were actual tapes left behind by the shooters at Columbine. In the back of my mind I knew what I was watching could not be real but at the same time the acting was so convincing you had to keep giving your head a shake. Is the film disturbing? Absolutely! Are you going to see things that will make you question the merit of the film? Probably. I think what most people will find disturbing is they will actually have feelings for the two lead characters, Calvin and Andre (Played by Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck). Why is that problematic for some people? Calvin and Andre are planning a massacre at their high school. I know for myself, I felt an immense sadness for Andre and Calvin. I had empathy for them because their lives had come to such a horrific point. They had fallen so deeply through cracks that they had begun a journey down a road which could have been stopped, if only people around them had taken notice to their plight. Zero Day is a phenomenal film. It gives you an up close and personal look to events that most of us will only ever see the conclusion to on the news. It leaves you thinking about the lives involved. And it leaves you perplexed how people get to this point. A week after seeing this film, I still think about it.Those of you who have not seen Zero Day please keep in mind the following: The film is an independent with little to no budget and the film is shot on camcorders. The material in the film is disturbing. This is not mainstream Hollywood and there is no happy ending. But if you can put all that aside, Zero Day is a film that will stick with you and just maybe help you to open your eyes a little.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI2MmE4NjItYWNiZi00MTEyLTk3OTgtYmEzYWI2ZmRkMzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

As good as that was, I just thought this was even better.All the voice-overs are excellent with Nathan Lane having the best lines as ""Snowball,"" the cat. He was simply hilarious, line after line.The film once again features great colors, a virtual rainbow of them, especially with some of the inventive rooms in the Little house. The parents, once again, are super nice. It's a treat to watch Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie play an old- fashioned ""Leave It To Beaver""-type couple. The film has no objectionable material and leaves you with a nice feeling. There are animated films or animated/real life combinations like this, that advertise ""family-friendly viewing"" but don't really deliver, instead sneaking in sexual innuendos and the like.Not here. This one is pure, morals-wise, except for one scene near the end when the mom (Geena Davis) tells Stuart and their son she's still proud of them even though they just got caught in a big lie. (Inferring that the lie was okay since everything turned out okay.) Other than that, nothing but good messages were heard and seen all around and this is a funny movie, to boot.

I have read some of the commments in here and there's are actually two people that said the exact same thing about the film. And that was that the film should have ended when the priest was looking into the house and he sees the spirit of the dead girl walking. Then the old lady comes up to him and says she has heard stories about the house. That would have been an awesome way to end it and I then would have given it a ten. As it stands I am still giving it an 8 because even though the end was contrived and straight out of The Exorcist, it is still one hell of a scary film. And if you thought you had reason in the first one to yell "" Get out!"" then wait till you see this one.The first hour of this film is absolutely terrifying. It has so much atmosphere and chilling scenes that I couldn't understand why people hated this film so much. The room in the basement is dark, dingy and the camera work is so spooky that you can't help but get suckered into believing that something is in there. When the mom is ironing and she feels something touch her arm and then the wind, that was a perfect scene. It was frightening. But the highlight of this film is when the family minus Sonny goes to church. It is here that Sonny gets stalked by an unseen force. And I even caught myself yelling at the TV, "" GET OUT! "" When he goes up the stairs and then down and then back up again into his room, it bothered me and it literally gave me chills. The camera work is so creative and haphazard that you really can't tell where the demon is. Is it on the ceiling, behind him, in front of him, where? That was a brilliant sequence in the film.Some of the acting is pretty bad especially from the mom, but it makes up for that with its chills and tension. I really think that people that criticize this film are perhaps people that should watch it again. I saw it for the first time when I was about 16 and thought it was okay, but then I rented it today and it frightened me during the day. That is pretty good film making. And is it me or are Italian directors better at good horror than the average north American director? Because I've seen some pretty scary horror films that were directed by Italians and they seem to have a style all their own. Just a thought.Amityville II is a perfect film to watch before the original. It is actually a prequel and it is good to watch them back to back. Give this film a chance and I'll bet it will scare you. It did a pretty good job on me.8.5/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTAyOTY4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMwODQ2NA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I love hardcore crimers and this is a great example of its genre. It shows just how corrupted the authorities really were in the 1980's rural Spain without losing touch with its relatively complex plot. The setup is familiar; two city detectives investigate a series of killings in provincial Spain. I wouldn't know where exactly this area is, but I'm guessing it's the marshlands in Andalucia (my bad if I missed any other detail, I was excited to see the movie so I might have overlooked something). Anyway, it all gets very much complicated as the investigation moves forward and more people are implicated in the case. I'm not going to spoil anything, but be warned that this is not just your usual straightforward murder mystery, as it is also a detailed look into a country shaken by political instability and corruption within the authorities. That said, there are some obvious similarities with other crime-thrillers like Memories of Murder or Red Riding (which I both heartily recommend), or TV shows like True Detective (although I'm not sure about this since I haven't started following TD yet). The acting is more than solid, especially good are the two main leads. Pedro's character was more likable than Juan's, partially because he despises Franco's regime and its legacy, while Juan didn't seem to care much about that. His share of problems stems from some ugly acts in the past and that is reflected in his often violent work methods. Yet, there is no denying both actors did a splendid job and had no problem dealing with their roles' demands. An interesting bit are a couple of symbol-heavy scenes that include Juan and a bird seemingly staring at each other; one might ramble that the bird represents a new era for the country, a fresh beginning if you like (as it can fly away anytime it wants), while Juan is a man tormented by a violent past he can't escape.But what I really delighted in was the exceptional cinematography. The movie looks fantastic and every detail is captured in beautifully placed shots. The marshlands are bathed in vivid colors, especially during the sunset. Camera-work is top-notch; I guess mr. Catalan really knows what he is doing. Thankfully, he was also rewarded for his work.In short, this is a dark, expertly paced thriller that remains ambiguous even after the satisfying conclusion. Definitely recommended if you're into movies like this.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NzY0MjI0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjcxMjU5MzE@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He just about pulls off the hardass cop routine, but never really musters the enthusiasm to look like he's enjoying it. The bad guys glower and plot, hunting the fleeing pair down with ruthless skill (and some rather suspect computer trickery), then cocking things up each time allowing them to escape.

The storyline is different but the results are the same...Girl is raped as a child which causes her to be mute. She is picked up by a slick-talking guy and taken out for dinner and drinks. Back at his house, he drugs her and shoots her up with heroin for several days, so by the time he allows her to wake up out of her heroin-stupor, she is an addict. At that point she is turned-out as a prostitute and given some cash and drugs as ""payment"". She is given some free time to herself, where she uses the money earned to take karate,shooting, and driving classes. Needless to say, when she becomes proficient enough in these disciplines, she uses her newly honed skills to go after those that did her wrong...Christina Lindberg is excellent as the beautiful and seemingly innocent looking mute girl. She is a real pleasure to look at, and the fact that she's naked through a good portion of the film doesn't hurt either. There is some ""controversy"" surrounding this film due to a couple of hardcore sex scenes (obviously not Ms. Lindberg, unfortunately...) that appear to be cut from a bad European porno. The scenes are not necessary for the film but were obviously added to heighten the shock value of the film overall. Other than those few scenes, and the famous scalpel-in-the-eye scene, the violence in THRILLER is relatively tame by exploitation/horror standards. Overall a really good film, if you are into the rape/revenge genre - I think it's always cool to see a strong, sexy, female lead who kicks ass, one of the reasons that I gravitate toward this type of film. The eyeball and sex scenes may be a little much for the casual movie-goer, more ""extreme"" fans should like this one.

I was hoping that it would be THE movie for fans of metalcore. But it wasn't just my overly high hopes for this movie that made me incredibly disappointed. I am usually very good at seeing the good parts of bad movies, as in, ""Well, the acting wasn't very good, but the story was great!"" While parts of this movie were alright, maybe even good at parts, not one aspect of this film was good all the way through.Writing: 3/10 The basic story of American Satan might have been good if it was handled better. However, the script, if indeed there was a script, was awful, and many, many times it was hard to tell if the bad product on screen was because of bad writing or bad acting. The production quality didn't turn out to be good enough to convincingly carry the scope of the film, which could have been better handled if the writer/director knew his own limitations. Directing: 4/10 When I saw the movie, I didn't know that the writer/director, Ash Avildsen, is the CEO and founder of Sumerian Record, the label that produces Asking Alexandria, (a great band, for the record). If I had known this I might have had a slight inclination that this movie was made with no better prospects than to reel in Andy Biersack fangirls, and metalcore fans, myself included, and not delivered with passion for or love for the music, or even quality movies. What was caught on camera and put on screen, at times, was so chaotic and incoherent, as my friend and I were watching the movie, at a pivotal part of the film, my friend looked over at me and asked, ""Wait, what happened?"" and I had to explain what I was pretty sure had happened but was not clearly shown. Also, what the trailers showed of the band playing in the movie looked great and I was really looking forward to it, however what was shown in the movie looked like it was ripped straight from a concert tape of your average rock band. I couldn't get into it, even as a huge fan of the kind of music they play. All in all, it just wasn't good, and I believe the person most at fault for this entire catastrophe is the writer and director himself. Acting: 5/10 The acting in this movie is very spotty. Sometimes it seems like the newcomers to acting and stars of the movie, Andy Biersack and Ben Bruce are doing very well with their acting debut, and other times its painful to watch. This goes for the experienced actors of the film to, finger pointed straight at Malcolm McDowell. But, as said before, it's often hard to tell if the poor product on screen is the fault of an actor doing their job poorly, or if the script they were given was just god-awful. Overall: 4.5/10 There's not a lot to like here unless you're a die-hard Andy Biersack, Black Veil Brides fangirl, or boy, and consider everything he touches to be descended straight from heaven. Anyone who considers himself a fan of quality films, or at least have one thing, one good aspect of a movie to praise after devoting almost two hours to it, should probably go look somewhere else.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjBjYWYxOTMtZTNhYS00OTc5LWJkYzgtNzZlMDNjNWU5NGVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjMzMjEyMDA@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

You could replace the UFO with a sighting of a gnome, goblin, troll, faerie, pixie or Elvis Presley and not a single thing in the movie would change.If you've got an hour and a half to spare watching this movie, consider going outside to watch the grass grow instead.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDU2YWVlNGMtNzY1Ny00MWRkLThiZTQtYjk3ZDlkY2VlNjI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUxMjU1NDQ@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The screenplay is highly poetic even when describing destruction, death, and madness.  Several jump cuts in time occur with voice-over, and, at the beginning, voice-over during a montage of frightening images from the aftermath of the Hiroshima bombing and the bodies of the two lovers in bed. The characters represent different cities; the Japanese man, Hiroshima, the French woman, a city in France, Nevers (was this intentional?), but the latter might as well represent any outside nation.  While ""Hiroshima,"" even after being destroyed by an ""ally"" of France, falls in love with her and wants her to stay, despite his claims that she can never know what the bombing was really like, yet leaving this in the past without forgetting, ""France"" is hung up on a dead Nazi soldier whom she had loved, and became an outcast because of it.  What the soldier really seems to represent is not the Nazis, but rather a real, true love that transcended nationalities and associations.  France's past is personal and fears forgetting it, while Hiroshima's is communal and, while not wanting to forget, also wants to move ahead.  For this reason Hiroshima keeps trying to convince France to stay so that they can be in love, but France is too preoccupied with its own personal ghost that it cannot share, which is why it is a major breakthrough for her when she tells her tragic story for the first time to anyone, Hiroshima.  Hiroshima's past tragedy being communal is shared and it wants to share with the rest of the world.  France's tragedy is personal and is only beginning to be shared.  It takes the entire film before the two characters can get to a beginning of something more than their differences and likenesses of tragedy and loss in the past, and this beginning is who they really are, in the present, two people reborn from these tragedies.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY2NTA1MzUwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTc4NTU4MjE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The film is based on a novel by David Joy and stars Billy Bob Thornton, Robin Wright, Jackie Earle Haley, Katelyn Nacon, and Finn Wolfhard. The film depicts the harsh realities of life in the Appalachian Mountains, where poverty, violence, and addiction are rampant. The film is directed by Ben Young, who previously made the acclaimed horror films Hounds of Love and Extinction.I thought this film was decent but not remarkable. I liked the performances of the actors, especially Thornton and Wright, who gave some depth to their flawed characters. I also liked the cinematography and the soundtrack, which captured the mood and atmosphere of the setting. However, I felt that the film was too predictable and clichÃÂ©d.

To this day, I still find it a mystery as to why I didn't see it again since, and I can't think of a convincing enough reason why other than I forgot about it. Then, I was reading some reviews by chance that were praising this film, and I decided I must give it another chance. Thank goodness for YouTube. And you know what, I am glad I did that, and now I am kicking myself for only seeing this film once in my childhood. Seriously I loved it, why it is so underrated I don't know.I am also scratching my head on some of the aspects of the film critical reviews have picked up. Critics complained of dull characters, and others of forgettable songs. Now I will admit that Cats Don't Dance is surprisingly ambitious, but I cannot disagree more with the criticism that it has forgettable music. I thought it was wonderful, the incidental music itself was beautiful, but the songs were amazing and definitely memorable, from the wonderfully energetic end number, to the poignant one sung by Sawyer in the rain. Though special mention has to go to Big and Loud, where Lindsay Ridgeway did a spectacular job with the singing voice of the antagonist Darla Dimple.And the characters certainly weren't dull. Danny is a very likable Gene Kelly-like protagonist, and Sawyer is lovely. And if you're looking for a character for comic relief, look to Flannigan especially. But the most memorable character is easily Darla, wonderfully voiced by Ashley Peldon. You could say Darla is like Shirley Temple's evil twin, she is very cute yet she is mighty mean too. Her bodyguard Max for some reason frightened me at the end when he was chasing Danny when I first saw Cats Don't Dance. The animation is colourful and detailed, and the voice cast is excellent. Other definite pros are in the surprisingly consistent and mature scripting, the inspired story, its constant sense of fun and the glamorous and irresistible choreography. All in all, despite the decent enough rating on IMDb(though I personally think it should be in the 7s) this is a very underrated and almost forgotten film. 10/10 Bethany Cox","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTU1ZDA5YjUtNmNhOS00Mzg3LTgwYjMtYWIzZjFhZDY5OGNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He has a perfect, muscled body, a smile that could melt an iceberg, and he even washes the dishes. They have sex 2 or 3 times a day. Not a week, a day.But it isn't enough for her. She wants more.But more of what? That's one of the problems with this movie. There is a lot of sex in it, though none of it shocking by modern movie standards. But for all the sex, we still have to guess at what Zoe wants. Is it yet more sex? Different sex? Kinkier sex? Is this a distant cousin to *Fifty Shades of Grey* that dares not speak of its desires? Zoe hooks up with an unsubtle but muscled white painter - who, in my eyes, has no talent - and has with him what looks like pretty much the same sort of sex she had been having with her husband. Then she hooks up with a messenger on a motorcycle. Their sex, though no doubt wonderful, looks pretty much the same as what she is having with the other two men, though it usually takes place on a table.In between all this, Zoe ignores her children and lets her work go down the drain. She is, we are to believe, a sex addict.That's the first problem. Zoe comes across as insatiable, but not really addicted. She only has men who are so astoundingly handsome/sexy that they would tempt all but the most virtuous. Yet if this movie had been called *Insatiable*, she would have come across as a harlot rather than a sick individual to be pitied, and would have lost the sympathies of the intended audience of well-meaning 20-40 something women. If she were actually addicted to sex, she would have had sex with anyone, and that is not the case. She is only attracted to the hottest men.The second problem is that her poor husband, Jason, evidently detects nothing once Zoe is unfaithful to him - daily. When he does finally learn he's unhappy, of course, but we know so little about him, he's so poorly developed, that we still can't sympathize with him, though he is the potentially most sympathetic character in the movie.These actors could probably all have done a lot better if they had been given a script that had developed characters and not just cardboard cut-outs. As it is, we get to watch a lot of evidently passionate sex performed by beautiful bodies, and then at the end have to listen to a few lectures on sexual addiction, which don't come across as very convincing. Zoe's particular case is never explored, so it's hard to believe in it or feel for her.Zoe's sexual problems with Jason needed to be made clearer. How was he failing her? Jason needs to have been given a character; it's not enough for him just to look great. The script just doesn't make any of the characters interesting and sympathetic, and that's fatal here.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjMzMTUyNzU3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjM5MjAwMjE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I don't know, but it was completely unnecessary and jarring. Speaking of the songs in this movie - they are just not memorable. Again it just reminds you how much better Disney is at creating musical pieces which grip you and stay with you. Perhaps it would have been better to just leave out the singing. Especially the pop numbers. From that moment on the characters become kind of bland and lose me. Their motivations are questionable. The pacing is all over the place. I just couldn't wait fir the whole thing to end. It could have been a great movie but it's like they run out o steam mid writing and animating and it just turned into awfulness. I'd rate it between 4-5.

Some may consider it a stuffy period piece before seeing it if they know only of the novel.  Don't make this mistake if you have not witnessed this cinematic milestone.  The title, of course, is caustic and refers to the 19th century family sarcastically.  Who else but the great Orson Welles could follow up a masterwork like CITIZEN KANE with such a cynical and important drama.  The ""magnificence of the Ambersons"" is neither grand, nor respectable.  It is tragic and doomed, epitomized by young ""Georgie"" (played by Tim Holt), whose main ambition in life is to be a yachtsmen.  He is buried under the lore of his family name and he is headed towards his well-deserved ""comeuppance"". The film itself, like many of Welles' great pictures, was absolutely butchered by the studio (RKO Pictures) and destroyed the credibility of the young auteur.  In many ways, the mess surrounding the film's release, the tragedy and loss of the Ambersons, and the theme of modern technology ""taking over"" all come together to leave all parties disappointed. Disapproving moviegoers miscalculated the message, led the studio to make the cuts behind Welles' back, and placed a lot of artists in some bad situations. (For an excellent account of this truly remarkable story behind the film, read Joseph McBride's bio ""Orson Welles"")  50 minutes of film were burned, however, the 88 minutes left for us to see contain some incredible, even revolutionary moments.Joseph Cotten plays his consummate ""2nd place"" character, a man unable to have his real true love. (See THE THIRD MAN, NIAGARA)  He is in love with an ""Amberson"" (probably the only righteous family member played by Dolores Costello) but loses out to a more ""respectable"" man.  The essential themes of industrialism and change that will ruin the Amberson family stem from Cotten's position as an inventor.  He has created the horseless carriage, or automobile, however primitive, which is continuously trashed by the hateful ""Georgie"".  Cotten's invention is part of the growth and change that many families of the late 19th century may have ignored, only to have their lives passed over and fortunes lost.  Plot elements aside, this central theme is the powerful backbone that leads to the inevitable destruction of the narrow-minded Tim Holt.The latter aspects come across on screen so memorably because of Orson Welles' continued experimentation with film.  Incredible b & w photography, at first a hazy glow depicting the early prime years of the Ambersons, then a stark, dark force portraying shame and sadness, is amazing to see. Overlapping dialogue is used even better here than in KANE and Welles' narration is so omniscient and on the mark, relaying the town's thoughts on this once grand family.  Long tracking shots throughout the constantly changing town go unnoticed unless seen a couple of times.  When you realize the passage of time through these devices, you will be in awe.Again, there is tragedy in both the film itself and its shoddy release and treatment in 1942.  If only Welles stayed in America at the time and protected THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS from the long arm of the near-sighted studio system, he may have had #'s 1 and 2 on the AFI's list of 100 Greatest American films.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ4Y2I5MzYtNDJkZS00YTFmLWJkODctMmU3YzQ3ZDhkMWE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

While one minute the viewer is laughing along with the youthful, if naÃÂ¯ve, exuberance of the young Karin (Birgitta Petterssen), the following minute will encourage different emotions as Bergman plunges the viewer into the middle of a nightmarish crime perpetrated by nothing less than the evil inside man. Although the portrayals of the acts committed in 'The Virgin Spring' are far less graphic than the modern viewer may have become accustomed to, they still retain an immense power to horrify as one cannot ignore the great lengths Bergman has gone to in order to give his characters a base in order to harden the impact of what we see. With just the simplest of dialogue, the viewer continues to learn about the relationships and personalities of each of the characters so that we may appreciate the consequences and, in some ways, forgive the actions that we see. This film is, after all, a tale of morality and repentance and therefore, even while in some cases the actions may be evil, it is necessary to accept the goodness that is still there. This thought is made no clearer than during the solemn and subdued final scene which fades out abruptly and leaves the viewer in a state of quiet reflection.Bergman's pacing and subtle direction which at one point leaves the viewer in suspense for what seems like an eternity is surely the reason for the greatness of this film. As if he were playing chess, he manipulates not only the characters, but the emotions of the viewers with intelligent and surprising maneuvers while pressing home his own sentiments regarding the story so that we may at least take into great consideration the events that we have seen. Bergman has an amazing ability to flip the atmosphere of a movie in a split second using various lighting and camera angle techniques as well as motivating his performers to follow suit. The simple expression changes on the faces of Birgitta Petterssen, Max von Sydow, Birgitta Valberg and Gunnel Lindblom at various points throughout the film quickly alter the mindset of the viewer and indicate that all is not well; so beautiful in undeniable simplicity.'The Virgin Spring' is nothing short of a masterpiece and a film that few will be able to forget. 9ÃÂ½/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDgyNmMzYmYtYzAwZi00NGU4LWJjYmQtNzY0MmUyNDQ1NzBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The mood and creepiness was pretty intense at times.It is NOT just a remake of the original movie, as some would have you think. Yes, it uses that format, and follows it pretty closely, but does it better and takes it a few steps farther. Just because it uses the same format doesn't mean it is the same movie. That is like saying all 'Cop' movies or all 'Buddy Pictures' are the same, just because they also follow the same format.If you saw the first movie, you will recognize everything that is happening here, but that doesn't decrease the sense of dread and hair-raising-on-the-back-of-your-neck scariness. Instead, I think it will increase your enjoyment as you watch things develop. Talk about things that go 'bump in the night!' And sometimes in the daytime, too!

"Pollock","2024.0","R","122.0","Biography, Drama","7.0","77.0","Ed Harris","Ed Harris, Marcia Gay Harden, Robert Knott, Molly Regan","29,657","A film about the life and career of the American painter, Jackson Pollock.","151","In The Abstract","The romantic notion of suffering for one's art has been cinematically rendered in countless films, depicting the lives of real life artists ranging from Van Gogh to Camille Claudel to Beethoven to Jim Morrison to Rimbaud; but rarely has a film penetrated as deeply as `Pollock,' directed by and starring Ed Harris as the abstract painter Jackson Pollock.  The story begins in 1941 and chronicles Pollock's life until the early ÃÂ50s. It's a vivid, and at times grim portrait of a true artist struggling for recognition, as well as with the inner demons that plague his soul and are reflected in his art and the way he lives his life.  It is said that the artist `sees' the world differently than the average person, which may be true; and it is that unique `vision' that sets the artist apart.  And Pollock was no exception to the rule.	As romantic as it may sound, the reality of suffering for one's art is just that:  Suffering.  For realizing that vision and bringing it to fruition is more often than not an arduous and tortuous path to tread.  Coalescing the fragments of that vision and transferring that information into reality can be a painful process, and one of the strengths of this film is that it so succinctly conveys that sense of desperation and frustration that are seemingly an intrinsic part of `creating.'  There's a scene in which Pollock, after having been commissioned to do a mural, sits on the floor of his studio with his back against the wall staring for days on end at the blank canvas stretched across the room, waiting for that spark of inspiration, that sudden moment when what he must do will crystallize in his mind's eye.  It's a powerful, intense scene that allows you to share that creative process with the artist and experience the emotional turmoil of it, as well as the exhilaration of the moment when it all suddenly becomes clear, when the vision is realized.  It's a stunning moment; Pollock's face fills the screen and you actually see it in his eyes, the exact moment of discovery.  And it's absolute magic.	As Pollock, Ed Harris gives arguably the best performance of his career; he perfectly captures every emotional level of this complex individual, from the manic highs and lows (exacerbated by alcohol consumption) to the neutral moments in between.  He totally immerses himself in the character, and what surfaces is a thorough and memorable picture of a tortured genius and flawed human being.  It's an astounding piece of work, for which he most certainly should have taken home the Oscar for Best Actor.	Marcia Gay Harden received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Lee Krasner, the woman who loved Pollock and devoted herself (even at the expense of her own career as an artist) to the man and his art.  It's a terrific performance, through which Harden brings Lee to life, physically and emotionally.  Her amount of screen time seemingly should have qualified her for a Best Actress nomination, but regardless, her work here is unquestionably deserving of the Oscar.	The supporting cast includes Amy Madigan (Peggy Guggenheim), Jennifer Connelly (Ruth), Jeffrey Tambor (Clement), Bud Cort (Howard), John Heard (Tony), Sada Thompson (Stella Pollock) and Val Kilmer (Willem de Kooning). Harris' triumph with `Pollock' does not begin and end with his extraordinary performance, however; though his acting is so exceptional it would be easy to overlook the brilliant job of directing he did with this film.  And it is brilliant.  The way this film is presented is the work of not only a seasoned professional, but of a professional artist with a unique vision of his own.  One of the best films of the year (2000), hopefully it will in the future receive the acclaim of which it is so richly deserving.  Hopefully, as well, Harris will direct again; for it is talent like his, and films like this one, that expand the Cinematic Universe as we know it.  I rate this one 10/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDU0NjJkNGQtOGY0ZS00MTEyLTk4NDEtODA5MTc4NGY1NjZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyOTc@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Sure, Lorraine Bracco is a bit shrill. No one said she came from a ""high class"" family, just that she was marrying well. My sister-in-law is a scientist with NIH and she came from humble roots. That Bracco got through to the tribe's medicine man when Connery had failed was the contrast between the two approaches the ""white man"" could make toward the natives. Bracco's negotiating skills and stubborn common sense contrasted nicely with Connery's unintentionally patronizing approach. Who COULD have been cast who would have been more convincing as the ""civilized"" woman ""going native"". Lauren Hutton, maybe. The solution to the mystery of ""compound 37"" was a genuine surprise, even though it was partially revealed on two separate occasions.

At the same time, the general's sins are coming home to roost in a very literal way.There is an element of horror here, but I was much more enthralled by the family drama of the piece.

A real life black cat prowls around a maze of pipes and fences, as Elmer Bernstein's jazzy musical score blares out the film's title song, a haunting invocation to low life everywhere.Throughout, both the music and the B&W cinematography evoke a noirish, downbeat mood totally in sync with the film's theme of embittered sleaze. Although set in the 1930's, the film looks and sounds more like something from the hip, ""beat"" generation of the 1950's. And I'm comfortable with that.What I'm not comfortable with is the casting and the screenplay. Lithuanian born Laurence Harvey is totally not convincing as a Texas tramp. French born Capucine, looking like she just walked in from the set of ""La Dolce Vita"", seems lost in the role of a Southern belle. A somewhat inexperienced Jane Fonda overacts the role of Kitty Twist. And American Anne Baxter, looking more like Suzanne Pleshette than Anne Baxter, plays a Mexican senorita, with the help of a big wig. Among the major roles, the only credible cast member is Barbara Stanwyck, as the bossy owner of the Doll House, your typical red light house of prostitution.The film's red light title is a big tease. It advertises brothel life, but the screenplay delivers only boredom and preachy morality. But in 1962 the moralistic Hays Code still exerted influence on what Hollywood could say and show. The result here is a yellow light plot that merely hints at sleaze.Forty years after its release, ""Walk On The Wild Side"" does have entertainment value, both as a curious period piece, and as a sudsy soap opera with some campy dialogue, helped along by the always engaging Barbara Stanwyck.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4YzI0NDQtMzU1NS00MzU2LTg1OWMtMDUwMWRhNDc2ZGVkL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Each time I watch it I discover something I missed in the previous viewing. There are no wasted lines or scenes. It is a powerful 1996 movie with excellent performances, dealing with the touchy subject of child abuse.Anjelica Huston is the director and this is her first attempt at directing a feature length movie. The results are stunning. It is altogether a flawless movie, with an excellent script based on the Dorothy Allison novel, and stars Jena Malone as the young protagonist. Jennifer Jason Leigh is in the tough role of the mother torn between the choices she faces in loving both her daughter and the abusive stepfather. Many times throughout the movie I sat on the edge of my seat stunned by the action happening onscreen. It is not a movie with pat answers and predictable solutions, but manages to show the complexities involved in each situation. There are no cardboard characters either, as in real life not everyone is totally good or evil, though their actions may dip into either category from time to time.The most compelling performance, in a film loaded with excellent acting, comes from young Malone, who commands a role that many adult actresses would no doubt have trouble handling. Her face tells a thousand stories with each shot giving a multi-leveled meaning to the deeper motivations that lie within her character.After the credits Glenne Headly provides further information about the subject and a child abuse hotline number, which is a great addition to a film of this sort. It is not ""entertainment"" per se, but more along the lines of an informational public service. The symptoms of child abuse are highlighted throughout the movie and the effect of everyone's participation documented as fair warning to the viewer.I can't praise this movie enough. A film like this raises my awareness and compassion level and makes me want to reach out to help in any way I can. It exceeds expectations in just about every way imaginable.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRlZWU2NjktYzhkYS00YmFkLTlhMGYtNWZjZjE4Mzc0NWJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR5,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It is such a carefully crafted piece of work that you can tell means a lot to its creators.It is a simple story that isn't all that fresh but in other ways it is. There is lots to read into about these characters especially the young lead. They painted such a picture of this character that you infer other things that are not pointed out to you.The way they use the costumes in the first shot to show that this family doesn't exactly have lost of money but showing us the holes in the boys top and the beat up pair of shoes on the woman feet. It is so subtle and you may miss it but it gives it so much more than just being like ""We have no money, we are poor"".The score is really subtle and suits the film really well as i think that word encapsulates this whole movie. It isn't all flash and guns blazing. It has things going on in the background that are sad and heartbreaking but it doesn't bring them to the front of the movie much as i think he wanted to show that they go on in life and people don't want to talk about it.There isn't so much of a plot as there is a theme. Time is the theme of this movie and how you wish you could slow it down or go back and change things.

But then there is a murder.","12","Juvenile Delinquents!","Juvenile delinquency was a very hot topic in the late fifties and early sixties. The new scourge of civilization, rock and roll, had transformed the younger generation into rebels who wanted to cast off the repressive rules by which they were expected to conduct themselves. The burgeoning post-war economy was removing the fear that had formed so much of the older generation's embracement of responsibility and the ever-quickening pace of materialistic progress was making any prospect of boredom anathema to the young.This certainly didn't go unnoticed by the establishment who were understandably alarmed by what appeared to be a rise in youthful disrespect and hedonism and the war of the generations was taken fairly seriously for a while. Hollywood quickly realized that this was a very sexy and saleable topic for entertaining the masses and began churning out dramas of rebellious youth by the boatload. By 1960 (the year this film was released) these rebellious youth movies were becoming pretty repetitive as far as contemporary settings went, so it was a darned good idea to take the issue and transfer it to a different time - the old west.It worked rather well, I think. Westerns tend to be fairly simple story lines for the most part anyway, so bringing an aspect of modern juvenile delinquency into the western was novel enough to spice up both tired genres a little. I watched it on the late show when I was on a baby-sitting gig and it made my night. Held my interest all the way and I enjoyed repeated viewings of it over the next couple of years.It's well acted by all. John Saxon has a great time playing the quietest but most dangerous gang member and Jeff Chandler gets to be a bad-tempered hero. As a small and relatively simple movie with a social message geared to the time of its release it's not really an 8 now, but I think it deserves a little better rating than it has here so I've given an extra point or two to help raise the average and I don't think that's the wrong thing to do at all.

Each of the characters is nicely portrayed by accomplished actors.  The pacing, the subdued dialogue, all make this film work, even though it was felt necessary to doctor the plot and rename characters (this I will never understand).  I won't criticize because I've never felt that we should compare movies to books--they are different media--unless the plot is badly compromised.  This one is not.  I remember being really pleased as a young viewer that Christie is able to bring all issues to a resolution in a believable and realistic way--no hidden doors--no strange interventions.  She is able to do this even in her lesser books.  Sometimes it is preferable to not be open ended, leaving unfinished details.  I relish this author and the movies and movie portrayals of her books.I also need to mention the music.  The score is so carefully tuned to the actions of the characters.  The black and white photography lends itself well to the oppressiveness of the setting where the characters find themselves.

I loved Eddy Murphy in his first movies, he was a fast talking joke machine, he still is but the jokes are the same and comedy has moved on. For that matter I didn't like the comedy portion of this movie too much but I was deeply touched by the drama version. The solution to his problem is right in front of him and anyone who is willing to give this movie a fair chance will see it too and exactly this is what made the movie so strong because he is doing it all wrong and you want to scream at the screen and tell him what to do and how to do it.In my opinion Eddy Murphy gave a partially brilliant performance. As I said I didn't enjoy the comedy too much, it was some sort of best of Eddy Murphy but when you are willing to accept that this is actually a drama and understand the comedy part as the metaphor that it is you will love this movie and maybe pull something valuable out of the message.

But unlike Solondz, who never seems to like any of his characters, screenwriters Nicole Kassell and Steven Fechter appear to genuinely care about the people they create.Their story's really very simple: Walter (Kevin Bacon) gets out of prison after serving a dozen years for molesting young girls. He takes a job at a Philadelphia-area lumber mill and tries to get his life back together again, while dealing with his inner demons.What's likely to disturb many about ""The Woodsman"" is that Kassell and Fechter raise the intriguing question of whether someone who's done something despicable is not only capable of putting his life back together again after serving his time, but also whether society ought to allow him to do so. And to make our job even tougher, Kassell and Fechter don't turn Walter into a monster.""The Woodsman"" is aided immensely by a strong, compelling performance by Bacon. It's easily his best work, a role that requires him to underplay his character. Director Kassell isn't shy about letting the camera linger on Bacon's face and Bacon credibly brings to life Walter's suffering. It's a sensationally good performance. Bacon gives him depth and feeling and we suddenly find ourselves caring about this reprehensible man.There are some superb supporting performances, including Mos Def as a cop, David Alan Grier as Walter's boss and Benjamin Bratt proving he really can act if he's given a good role. The most interesting supporting character is Vickie, a coworker willing to give Walter a second chance at life. Kyra Sedgwick, a gifted, yet under-rated, actress, is utterly convincing as Vickie, a woman almost as damaged as Walter is. The Walter-Vickie relationship works because there's terrific chemistry between Bacon and Sedgwick. True, they're husband and wife, but real-life couples can fail miserably on screen. Kidman and Cruise in ""Far and Away"" (1992), anyone?Bacon and Sedgwick's scenes are tender, passionate and real. Though, there's one intimate moment between Walter and Vickie that's clearly inspired by the famous Donald Sutherland-Julie Christie love scene in Nicolas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now"" (1973).What makes ""The Woodsman"" such gripping viewing is that the film doesn't shy away from letting us into Walter's struggle. There's a particularly uncomfortable scene on a park bench as Walter comes to terms with his true nature.""The Woodsman"" is a film that deserves to be seen. It's a pity that less-than-mediocre movies, such as ""Connie and Carla"" and ""Twisted,"" get widely released, while a gem like ""The Woodsman"" gets to very few theaters. Seek out this film. It's not an easy film to watch, but the performances are all good, the story's riveting and it's definitely one of the best, most thought-provoking films of the year.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2NDI1NjM2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjIzMTg4NA@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Considering he was also the producer, he should have just left it at that - and the small role he also had as a member of the cast (Barry). Was it too much responsibility for one novice filmmaker to undertake? Certainly. Was it a mistake to have him in this type of film as his directorial debut? Absolutely.The pace of this film was *very* slow. Had I played this at 1.5x faster speed, it may have been more enjoyable. His selection of the score was terrible, if not clearly absent in parts that it should have been present.The story itself, although done before, did hold my attention and I found it interesting, primarily from the only actor that was the most convincing, Nicky Whelan as Katie. Clearly she is the one that held this movie together.Now of course, Faye Dunaway's small role was performed on point, but that comes expected with an actor of her caliber. What was disappointing however was the rest of the cast, particularly Gina Gershon as Angela, and Nicolas Cage as Brian. I'm a fan of Gina, but I felt she struggled with her role in this one, just as Nicolas did, of which I am also a long time fan of his. I have to admit, this is the first film I actually wished Mr. Cage over- acted his performance as he is well know to do so in his previous films.What's more shocking is how these two seasoned A-list actors accepted these roles. I would assume after reading the script, it sounded much better than it was directed, so thus their lack of excitement and convincement in their roles I blame fully on the director.Had this film been directed by someone else, I feel it would have been a huge success and much more enjoyable.At the end of the day, Jonathan Baker can add an undeserved notch to his directors chair, Nicky Whelan can add a well acted and deserved positive entry to her acting resume, and Nicolas Cage and Gina Gershon should hide this notch from their actors chairs.A generous 7/10 for an interesting script, held together primarily by Nicky Whelan. It's a shame this film ended up as a lost opportunity to be much greater. For that matter, it's inconceivable.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWM0ODdkNTYtNjAwNS00OTE1LTlhMWMtOGE5OThjM2MzMzAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4NTM5NDY@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It is extremely pleasing to read that this film has given a lot of pleasure to many who have seen it. Why I think the film succeeds is because it was written by a man who took part in the North African campaign, as a doctor in the RAMC, who had to deal with the human cost of war. People, and how they cope with adversity, is often more interesting than depicting warfare itself. This makes it an unusual war film for the time, to say the least. The character of Captain Anson, so ably played by John Mills, is telling for me as my grandfather sadly did have an alcohol problem later in life. On a lighter note, the terrific final scene in the bar has an amusing story attached to it - apparently, the scene had to be shot five or six times, and as nothing else looked like beer in a glass than, well, beer, poor John Mills had to keep knocking back the beers until the scene was ""in the can""!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzcxZDI4ZTAtMDBiYi00Y2FkLWFjYTQtNjJmNWU2ZjRhNjRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

One of Brian De Palma's most underrated movies, it isn't without some flaws, but overall I enjoyed it much more than some of his most recent disappointing efforts like 'Snake Eyes' and 'Mission To Mars'. They might be much better known than 'The Fury' but they are not better movies. The plot is a bit convoluted at times, and maybe a little TOO ambitious, but there are several classic sequences that make this a must see for any De Palma fan. The whole thing comes across like a cross between 'Carrie' (De Palma's previous movie), and Cronenberg's 'Scanners', a movie it predated by three years, interestingly enough. Amy Irving, who also appeared in 'Carrie', is beautiful and believable as Gillian, a troubled teen attempting to understand and control her frightening paranormal powers. Veteran Kirk Douglas ('Spartacus', 'Saturn 3') and cult director/actor John Cassavetes ('Rosemary's Baby', 'The Killers') are both solid as friends-turned-enemies who once worked for the same nameless Government agency. Douglas' psychic son Robin (Andrew Stevens) is kidnapped by Cassavetes and his cronies and experimented on until he reaches the brink of madness. Douglas desperately searches for him by any means necessary, a quest which inevitably means he encounters the traumatized Gillian, who has an increasing psychic link with Robin. Irving and Douglas are both excellent in this movie, Cassavetes plays a fantastic villain, and the supporting cast includes Carrie Snodgress ('Diary Of A Mad Housewife'), Charles Durning ('O Brother, Where Art Thou?'), Fiona Lewis ('Drum'), and cameos from Daryl Hannah ('Bladerunner'), De Palma semi-regular William Finley ('The Phantom Of The Paradise') and a noticeably younger and thinner Dennis Franz (NYPD Blue'). While I couldn't argue that 'The Fury' is De Palma's best work it has aged very well indeed and is recommended viewing. This is one movie that deserves to be re-evaluated!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ1OWUwNDMtYjFmMS00NTljLWIyYjgtMmI0NGFlNTQ5M2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I especially enjoy anthology films like ""Creepshow."" I was super excited to see some up and coming filmmakers showcase their talent. Little did I know that this is what would happen. There are maybe two to three decent shorts in here, but for the most part this is embarrassing. Rather than concentrating on telling interesting horror tales, the filmmakers here have decided to make crude and incomprehensible films. Most of the stories concentrate on sexually perverse imagery. The few decent (when I say decent I mean up to the level of an amateur) shorts are surrounded by absolute garbage. There is no artistic merit to be found. Most of the stories are lazy and inept. It's sad to say that most of the amateur shorts that were made for the contest leading up to this film are far superior. This is embarrassing. I am ashamed that I paid to watch this movie. If most of these shorts were introduced in an introductory film school class, they would be torn to shreds. This is quite possibly one of the worst films I have seen in my life. I'm sure people will jump to the movie's defense and say things like ""they were given creative freedom"" or ""this is art, you just don't get it."" Sorry, this is trash!

But when I read some of the negative comments about this movie, I ad to make a stand. I came across this movie accidentally and I'm glad I did. I think it is one of the unsung great films on music and musicians. Based on the true life of Jerry Lee Lewis, the somewhat eccentric rock and roll genius from the 50s this movie has got soul. Most of the movies about artists end up portraying them as somewhat crazy, egomaniacs, always on the edge of a break down. But this movie has a very warm and light hearted take on Jerry's life. Throughout his ups and down his character comes out as a likable one whom you want to fall in love with. There's not a moment in the film where you would feel sad or annoyed by Jerry. And for this the kudos go to both Dennis Quaid and the director. For the reviewers who have labeled Dennis's portrayal as over the top, you guys don't have a clue who and what Jerry was. Dennis has nailed the spirited and buoyant soul that Jerry Lee Lewis was. I think the people who didn't like this film wanted to see a more serious and toned down film. But this is a film about rock and roll, and there's no better way to make it then it has been donw here. I give it a 9 out of 10.

I didnt have to search much, several film critics allude directly to both movies blatant parallelisms. HereÃÂ´s a direct quote from THE WRAPÃÂ´S film critic Alonso Duralde;ÃÂ¨The worst sin of ""The Secrets We Keep"" is not that it so blatantly and flagrantly rips off Ariel Dorfman's play and subsequent movie ""Death and the Maiden"" - although if the Chilean author wanted to sue for a credit, he's certainly got a case.The history of art is the history of creators borrowing from each other, whether they call it homage or reference or appropriation. What grates about director Yuval Adler and his co-writer Ryan Covington pilfering so obviously from Dorfman's work is that they haven't done anything particularly interesting with it.ÃÂ¨I wont comment about the quality of the technical aspects of THE SECRET WE KEEP, IÃÂ´d like to focus on the plot, recently we had a simmilar case between Guiilermo Del ToroÃÂ´s THE SHAPE OF WATER and LET ME HEAR YOU WHISPER by Paul Zindel.David Zindel, son of playwright Paul Zindel, brought copyright infringement claims against the creators of the film The Shape of Water, the winner of the 2018 Academy Award for Best Picture, alleging that The Shape of Water infringed the copyright to his father's 1969 play Let Me Hear You Whisper.The district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss on the grounds that the parties' works are not substantially similar as matter of law, upon application of the Ninth Circuit's ""extrinsic test"" for determining substantial similarity.The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the district court erred in dismissing the case at the pleading stage because ""reasonable minds could differ on whether there is substantial similarity between Let Me Hear You Whisper and The Shape of Water,"" such that additional evidence, including expert testimony, could ""aid in the objective literary analysis needed to determine the extent and qualitative importance of the similarities"" between the two works and ""whether any similarities are mere unprotectable literary tropes or scÃÂ¨nes ÃÂ  faire.""If you as a screenwriter or director are inspired so much by a previous work of art that you have the intent to make your own personal version of such work, why not buy the rights or mention ÃÂ´inspired byÃÂ´ in the credits of your film, is it so hard? especially when you have the backing of powerful Hollywood studios like Fox Searchlight Pictures in the case of Del ToroÃÂ´s film, or AGC Studios, Di Bonaventura Pictures, Echo Lake Entertainment in the case of Adler and CovingtonÃÂ´s movie in question. Its not only common courtesy but a show of respect for the writers and filmmakers that came before and inspired you.Dorfman the playwright of Death and The Maiden is almost 80 years old, Polanski is bordering 90, I dont believe that they have the time or energy to pursue a lenghtly and costly court case, one would hope that the young Israeli authors of a film that aspires to tell a story about universal justice would have been more sincere to such commitment.I apologize for my horrible english. Good evening. And watch DEATH AND THE MAIDEN if you havent already, Its not only a marvelous film, but a true original.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTdmZTk2YmItMzgzMy00MWRhLTg4MzctNTJmYzM5MzE0NmM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODk4OTc3MTY@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The most stunning things were definitely NOT given away in the trailers. Fight sequences move extremely fast, but after watching a couple of them your eyes should be used to it and it won't seem so confusing. Cloud has a wide array of swords, and I kinda wish things were moving a LITTLE slower just so we could see them, because they were each incredibly detailed. Oh, and we finally get to see exactly how one equips Materia...Music: brilliant also. I was a bit nervous about it, since (from what I've seen) Nobuo isn't the best at writing music to go along with action (remember the Steal the Tiny Bronco sequence?), but it's brilliant and it fits perfectly. I'm glad I preordered the OST. They changed the lyrics to One Winged Angel though, so you won't be able to sing along if you know the Carmina Burana Lyrics.Plot: the first half of the movie sets up things and introduces everyone in a fairly complex tapestry, but the second half is almost entirely fight sequences, once all the players are in place. I wouldn't call it a weak plot, but it's nowhere near as convoluted as the game's plot was. I think this is in an effort to avoid trying to overshadow the game, and I think that's a good thing...the movie is its own entity, and shouldn't try to top the original in terms of sheer plot.I admit, I was kind of hoping that this movie would bring FF7 to a wider range of people, but this is NOT a mainstream movie. I was going to give it only nine stars, just because it doesn't even really try to explain anything to newcomers...Marlene (at least I think it was Marlene...sounded like her) gives a bit of background at the beginning, but it's more of a refresher than a crash course. But then I realized, for me this movie is a 10/10, so why should I take off points just because other people probably won't like it as well...if you've played the game, or are at least passingly familiar with it, you should see this movie. But you don't need me to tell you that. If you're not familiar with it, go out and buy it, sit there for twenty hours and beat it, and then see the movie...although even without any background, it's still stunningly beautiful. You just won't get any of the inside references...which make up 50% of the movie (that is, everything that ISN'T a fight sequence).","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk4NjBhZTUtN2MwMy00MzIyLWFhN2ItMmUwYzQ4MWQxODM3L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzM4MjM0Nzg@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Uses lightness and darkness to set up scenes and doesn't force hedonistic motifs onto the viewer but prefers to trust the viewer to come to it's own conclusions.

The first of two takes on classic Horror tales directed by Paul Morrissey, starring Udo Kier and Joe Dallessandro and (co-)produced by iconic artist Andy Warhol (the other being ""Blood For Dracula), ""Flesh For Frankenstein"" (which is sometimes referred to as ""Andy Warhol's Frankenstein"") is an Italian/French/American co-production that simply has to be seen to be believed.A blend of rich Gothic atmosphere, grotesque artsy imagery, unvarnished sleaze and excessive gore and wonderfully black humor, ""Flesh For Frankenstein"" is both a tribute to- and satire of earlier Horror greats. At the time of its release, the film was highly controversial for its depiction of sex and gore and even received an X-Rating in the US: No wonder, as this unspeakably morbid little gem features all kinds of demented scenes including explicit perversions, such as necrophilia, all containing a very VERY morbid sense of humor.Udo Kier shines as a very demented Baron Frankenstein (with a thick German accent), who lives with his sister/wife (!) Katrin (Monique Van Vooren), their two children, as well as his equally demented assistant in a castle in Serbia. Frankenstein plans to create female and a male Zombie from body parts; the natural children of his creations are then to become a perfect race of people. In the meanwhile, the super-potent stable-hand Nicholas (Joe Dallesandro) has sex with every female that crosses his way...Udo Kier fits perfectly in the role of the Baron - extremely demented, perverted and weird, Frankenstein constantly yells at his assistant for being a pervert. This Baron is dedicated to science and obsessed with results as are other Frankenstein versions in cinema (such as those played by Colin Clive or Peter Cushing), but, unlike these predecessors, he is also demented in every other imaginable way. Udo Kier is definitely one of Germany's greatest actors and doubtlessly THE remaining expert for sinister and eccentric characters since Klaus Kinski passed away. He is truly great here. Monique van Vooren is also very good as the Baron's equally malicious sister/wife - van Vooren looks very young for her age (she was 48 when the film was made), but also really weird, since she has no eyebrows. Italian Horror enthusiasts will notice that the Frankenstein couple's daughter is played by Nicoletta Elmi, who was in many other cult-classics such as Dario Argento's ""Profondo Rosso"" (1975), Mario Bava's ""Bay of Blood"" (1971) and ""Baron Blood"" (1972), as well as Aldo Lado's Giallo ""Who Saw Her Die?"" (1972).""Flesh For Frankenstein"" is a film that is very gory and outrageously morbid for its day. When I first saw it, some scenes even reminded me of Joe D'Amato's 1979 shocker ""Buio Omega"" (though this film isn't quite AS demented and sick as D'Amato's film). IMDb and some other sources credit Italian Horror deity Antonio Margheriti, who happens to be an idol of mine, as co-director of this film; however, it appears that Margheriti was merely credited to draw Italian viewers into cinemas, and had little to nothing to do with the actual production of the film. Either way, this is a must-see. ""Flesh For Frankenstein"" is a wonderfully bizarre, atmospheric, gory, demented, morbid, incredibly (and VERY darkly) funny film, that MUST be seen by all cult-cinema fans, and, personally, I cannot understand how anyone could not love it. My rating: 10/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzFjMzhhMjQtMjc5MC00ZmU2LWIwYmEtMTJlNzM5ZDZlNDFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The acting was sensational. The singing which was done by the actors themselves was fabulously passionate and real. Gwyneth, Garrett, and especially Leighton...WOW! The story line???

It is a fact-based drama about three teenage girls who found themselves in 1964 sentenced to work in a laundry run by an Irish religious order for an indefinite term and under conditions that made most audience members shudder.In three brief vignettes before the main title, the girls are introduced. One is brutally raped by a cousin at a wedding while priests perform traditional Irish songs.  Immediately telling a woman, instead of support she becomes the subject of a hasty conspiracy to spirit the rapist from the wedding and to place her in the Magdalene asylum.A second girl gives birth to a baby - in the not long ago past, illegitimacy was the label.  She is pressured by a priest to surrender the baby boy and then she, too, is hustled off to the asylum.The third victim is in an orphanage where she gets under the director's skin for no other offense than she is pretty and boys from the neighborhood crowd a fence to call down to her.  Transfer to the asylum follows.The Magdalene laundries made money for the order running them and the asylum to which the three girls were committed is, in this film,  a moral charnel house.  Sister Bridget, the head nun, interviews the girls while fingering, with almost erotic delight, rolls of money. Her desk sports a photo of President Kennedy but a picture of Ilse Koch would have been a more suitable iconographic representation of her character.  She is a sadist, first class.What follows is almost unrelieved tedium for the girls interspersed with brutal physical chastisement and agonizing sexual humiliation inflicted by perverted nuns.  Sexual orientation isn't my issue, it's the awful victimization of helpless young girls.Through the fine acting of the cast the complexity of relationships and the nature of choices become engrossing. To accommodate or to resist.  To comply or to engage in sabotage, even in small ways as a declaration of non-surrender.  Sabotage is possible but can an inexperienced and angry teen foresee the consequences of a minor act of resistance?  An anticipated humorous defiance may well have tragic results.The film centers on the three girls as well as several other asylum inmates ranging from a young woman descending slowly into irreversible madness and an elderly crone who believes her lifetime of servitude guarantees entrance to the Kingdom of Heaven.  This tortured soul is the nuns' ""capo,"" the inmate without whose help the asylum's strictures can't be enforced. Comparison to the Gulag camps and the Nazi concentration camps is apropos.""The Magdalene Sisters"" doesn't portray all the girls as angels but it does show the nuns and the occasional male clergy as evil exploiters and sadistic hypocrites.  Is that fair?  The end credits report that some 30,000 women were involuntarily placed in Magdalene asylums until the last one closed in 1996.  Were all inmates so tortured and beaten?  I don't know but these three girls certainly have had THEIR experience recorded for a population that appears to have turned a blind eye to what should have been a national scandal decades earlier.  Their life after the asylum is reported in the end credits. All paid a price for a stolen adolescence.The asylum in this film is pure evil, religious doctrine run amuck in the quest for money through cheap labor and in the riotous unleashing of perversity.  English judges for centuries have often used a word rarely found in  American case law to describe persons and events: the word is wicked.  This film projects an unending parade of wicked people performing wicked acts.  It doesn't condemn Catholicism, it indicts the operation by the church in Ireland of one type of soul and body destroying evil.

How this film slipped through is beyond me.","One of the greatest appeals of this film is its vernacular. Aside from being cast beautifully by talented actors in diverse roles set in an interesting story, it's the dialogue that is extremely memorable. That, and its great title.And with such a great cast and dialogue, I'm absolutely stunned as to how this great little film slipped through the cracks and didn't get a wider audience. Its theatrical run here in Toronto was limited, actually I'm making an assumption, I don't recall a listing for it, but before you knew it, it was gone. Perhaps it wasn't marketed well or supported strongly enough.I have recommended this film and lent it to many friends and every one of them has enjoyed it. I generally say, if you liked ""Pulp Fiction"", another film which is well cast and with great dialogue, then you will likely enjoy this one also.One of my favourite quotes from the film (or any) comes from a supporting player. Andy Garcia as ""Jimmy The Saint"", seeks the advice of Bill Cobbs, playing ""Malt"", a Soda Jerk, on whether he should impregnate his hooker friend as a favour to help straighten her out, Malt sarcastically replies:""That's just what the world needs... the unholy offspring of you two bag-o-smashes. That kid will be the anti-christ for sureÃÂ 666 written all over it.""Christopher Walken plays a memorable role of a crippled mob boss, known as ""The Man With The Plan"" who is disturbed by his son Bernard's manic and sexually obsessive behavior after having been dumped by the love of his life for another man. The Man With The Plan insists that Jimmy, come back to work for one job, an action, to scare the living daylights out of this new beau, and tell him to stay away from Bernard's former girlfriend.Jimmy is given the option to assemble his old crew for this action, which he does. A strange bunch of men who have been long out of any illegal action, some of whom miss it, and others whom do not.And that's just about where it gets real interesting.The story is laden with character revelation from a old wiseguy who just doesn't shut up and scenes from everyday people who offer their wisdom to videotape at Jimmy The Saint's legitimate but failing business, ""After Life Advice"" for people who are terminally ill and wish to pass on a legacy to their loved ones beyond the grave.Everyone involved with this film should be proud of their accomplishment. It is a great film and unfortunately hasn't been seen by many, by my account anyway. Let's see if we can't change that.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzI0OWEzZmItOGUyOC00M2Y2LWIzNDEtY2EzYzAwNWI0ZDkyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTc1NTQxODI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Corral.","96","Lancaster and Douglas --- Earp and Holiday","In one of her books Hedda Hopper devoted a chapter to both of the stars of Gunfight at the OK Corral, calling them the Terrible Twins. As a columnist Hopper was a firm defender of the old studio system and both Burt and Kirk were seen by her as betraying old Hollywood.Now personally I think their careers show that both of these guys knew exactly what they were doing in guiding their own destinies. This film is a great example of it. It was deservedly a critical hit and a moneymaker.No film has ever been made that completely told accurately the story of the famous gunfight, least of all this one. But it sure captures the spirit.I think both of these guys could have played each other's part and the film still would have been a winner. The problem with playing Wyatt Earp is that he's usually such a straight arrow on screen or on television that the main job of the actor is to keep from making him sound like Dudley Doo-Right. Burt Lancaster is capable enough and did it, but Wyatt Earp maybe one of the least complex roles he ever essayed.Kirk Douglas though is the best Doc Holiday I've ever seen portrayed. Doc Holiday is a brooding, consumptive alcoholic who's also a woman batterer. He treats Jo Van Fleet like garbage and her responses to him is responsible for several of the plot twists. As I've said before Douglas can flip into rage better than any other actor ever. Just watch him with Van Fleet after the youngest Earp brother has been killed.Today we would call Jo Van Fleet a battered spouse even though she and Douglas are living common-law. Her's is the next best portrayal in the film besides Kirk Douglas.Rhonda Fleming has little to do except look coquettish and beautiful as the lady gambler who Lancaster falls for. But that was usually enough for her public. It's ironic that she's playing a liberated woman for 19th century and Fleming's politics are quite right wing and Lancaster her very traditional 19th century man was a noted political liberal.And of course the unbilled co-star is Frankie Laine singing that wonderful title song by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington. Tiomkin was one of the best of movie composers, his music gave that extra oomph into a lot of good movies, making them great.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJlNWM2ODEtYTdhZS00MmMyLTg1NjItNWI3YTg1MDM4YjNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIzNDU3NDE@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The other cast are somewhat overshadowed by Snipes and Payne, but do an adequate enough job.Overall I was very pleased by Passenger 57, so much so that it proudly belongs in my DVD collection.

Though I really liked the first two thirds of the film (up to the point, when Stephen Dorff takes over the main-character (but that has nothing to do with his performance)). I found, that the last part was strange and somehow out of continuity. The first part strictly sticks to the idea of experiencing Apartheid from the view of a boy, who is growing up in a system of classes and injustice and who himself fails to really belong to any of these classes. The last part however suddenly tries to be a lot of movies in one: Action, Romance, Patriotism and a Historic Anti-apartheid picture. And I think, trying to do too much, it failed to be anything of the above in the end.The reason I'm writing this comment now is, that I am just done reading Bryce Courtenays novel. And I was really surprised to learn, that exactly after two thirds of the story, the movie totally goes its own way and ignores the course things take in the novel. The last part of the Novel is just as great as the first. If you liked the movie (or at least the first part) read the book, it's worth it!To sum it up: I believe The Power Of One had the potential to be an outstanding picture. The music was great, the landscapes beautiful and the acting excellent (Armin MÃÂ¼ller Stahl at his best). But unfortunately somebody tried to write an american ending for an african story and couldn't have failed worse.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ1NTYxOGYtNzc5MC00ZDY2LWE1ODctNmZjMzliYmNlMWMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Watching the film, I was aware that these events really did occur, and that the actors playing these characters were the real people involved (the opening credits clue us in, when they say, ""appearing as themselves""), but I did not catch on that the courtroom scenes were real footage -- to be honest, I'm still not quite sure. (That IMDb lists the judge in the credits as ""judge"" and not as ""himself,"" makes me suspect that this is indeed all a reenactment.) But whether or not the entire film is a reenactment or only the time-shifting parts with Sabzian and the family at their home are reenacted, the moment where Makhmalbaf appears onscreen is a transcendent one, as true in spirit as ""real life"" (which it may indeed be).Kiarostami is a true artist, the ideal described by Sabzian in the film, one who makes his films to depict the suffering of people. He's one of the few with the power to seem wholly pure -- he makes me feel, at least in the moment, that film's real artists are the ones who aren't mere stylists. They're the ones interested in our hopes, our guilts, our ambitions, our fears. The ones interested in people. And here, Sabzian is trying to do something for other people; he's symbol of their love for the arts, by himself masquerading as a great artist. He's living vicariously through the artist he admires, and in doing so -- however morally ambiguously -- accentuating the most candid aspects of himself. By simply assuming another name, he can have people treat his views with respect, and in this way the film is a scathing attack on celebrity status and the priority with which we give them. However, Kiarostami doesn't let us be satisfied with Sabzian's candor; we're never sure where we stand with him, and the possibility is that his entire court appearance is another grand performance. (With the credits rolling over a frozen image of Sabzian's face, and his general persona of a troubled but deeply good-hearted person, I was reminded of an adult Antoine Doinel.)Kiarostami and Sabzian admit that we're all actors in one way or another, from a director to you and me: ""We are the slaves of a mask hiding our true face. If we free ourselves from this, the beauty of truth will be ours."" This film and ""Taste of Cherry"" have got to me on such an intimate and personal level, and seem so honest and truthful -- sometimes in a seemingly banal way -- that I don't know how I can recommend them to others. While I think this is a masterpiece, if you expect to be blown away you'll be disappointed. But with artists this open, if you're willing to open yourself up, too, hopefully it can mean as much to you as it does to me. 10/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTEzNGU1ODQtZmEzZS00ODJlLWI3ZWItNmY1MTVjNjk0MzBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It touches on relationships, death, siblings, betrayal, unrequited love, honesty, fears, and forgivenessÃÂ and does so in a very believable and refreshing way.Most of the movie takes place at a secluded rustic waterfront cottage, a family cabin that Iris (Emily Blunt) has suggested her 'bestie', Jay (Mark Duplass) visit to clear his head; he's still emotionally stuck at the one year anniversary of his brother's death. The secluded locale - without phones, computers and the usually daily distractions - is the conduit which allows the abundance of emotions and introspective feelings bubble up and expose themselves to a trio of characters connected in various and interesting ways.These three individuals are both frustrating with their flaws, yet endearing with their fragility and weaknesses. How easy it is to identify with all of them! ÃÂ which can perhaps be attributed to the impromptu conversation Director Lynn Shelton nurtured and encouraged from the mere 70 page script. She confessed that 75% of the dialogue was improvised allowing a unique honesty to develop within each character, thanks to a stellar cast.I'm thankful Shelton stuck around Toronto for this third screening Ã¢ÂÂ she's originally from Seattle which is where this was filmed - and was more than willing to open up to the audience at a post Q&A where we heard her speak passionately and reflectively about the 12 day shoot (wow!) with almost no funding and how she lucked in to Emily Blunt coming on board (thanks to a shared agent) who was keen on the challenge and experience. Also it was nice to hear that during the festival the film had found distribution through IFC, and that cast and crew would now be compensated for this wonderful collaboration.This film's a winner to me.

The acting is perfect - the maid, Hannah, Turner, his father - in fact all the cast are excellent. But what lets it down, and what is unforgivable, is that even with an understanding of Turner's life this ""biopic"" doesn't tell a story. It is an endless series of scenes that attempt to be clever and give you a thousand windows into his life. But those windows are just that - they don't hint at a broader life, they just give you an impression of the man that you could get from a ten second description of him.

It's probably the ninth or tenth time I've seen it, and I think it gets better every time.

Sure, some of the humor in the film is of the car-crash can't look away variety, but I feel underneath that they really admire the guy and his dogged tenacity. Another thing is I think Mark does show some skill as a director. Remember he has zero money shooting this stuff, and Coven was conceived as a money-making venture so he could make Northwestern.  I think some of the samples they were showing from Northwestern actually looked very good.  Now I don't think Mark writes the best dialogue in the world, but looking just at his photographic eye I'd say if the guy had any kind of schooling he might be shooting movies for someone right now.

Ostensibly a comedy about the efforts of two slightly disgruntled, high spirited teenage girls (Hayley Mills and June Harding) to turn a convent school upside down, it combines lighthearted pranks with dry humor, most of the latter supplied by the splendid Rosalind Russell. As the worldly and wise Mother Superior, Rosalind is both amused and unsettled at the stunts her two incorrigible charges pull. The supporting cast is well chosen, with Mary Wickes (""Sister Act"") and Marge Redmond (""The Flying Nun"") standing out among the faculty nuns. Despite the unexpected appearance of legendary stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, cast as (what else?) a teacher of interpretive dance, both nuns and students are believable. Mills sparkles in her role as devilish Mary Clancy, as does June Harding as Rachel Devery, her neophyte partner in crime. Aided tremendously by a truly beautiful score by the great Jerry Goldsmith, (which has the remarkable ability to blend in with the film AND stand alone as a pleasurable listening experience) and directed with a sure hand by actress/director Ida Lupino, ""The Trouble With Angels"" is both funny and moving, one of the best family films ever made. Strangely enough, reviews were decidedly mixed (when not downright negative) back when the movie was released in 1966. But it was a sizable hit, and spawned an agreeable sequel (""Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows"") two years later. Today, it remains as fresh as ever, and head and shoulders above most of the contemporary family films which followed it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWUxM2Y5OTMtYmVmOS00NTA3LTk0OTYtZGFkOTIyODc2Mzk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The formerly peaceful community has suddenly been plagued by a series of grisly murders for the town sheriff Dan (James Farentino) to investigate. Creepier still, the murder victims reappear as walking, talking, friendly townsfolk. And what does the eccentric town mortician (Jack Albertson) have to do with it?This rarely talked about flick, above all else, is a masterpiece of atmosphere...moodily lit, foggy, with a genuine sense of claustrophobia as the horrors seem to be closing in closer and closer to Dan's own home and family, especially the strange new habits his wife (Melody Anderson) has taken up lately.All of the actors are solid enough, but Jack Albertson steals the show as the eccentric, big band loving Mortician Dobbs. In one of his final performances, he delivers a character whose unsettling realism and reverence for the dead will make you completely forget his also classic turn as the kindly grandpa in ""Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory"". Rather than just play this character, he inhabits his psyche and becomes Dobbs, and it shows.Everything from the low key bits of airy score music to the often slow and dreamlike pacing of the plot, is dedicated to heightening the viewer sense of disconnection and dread, leading up to a well known sort of ""twist"" climax, which in this context doesn't seem hackneyed.My only real problem with this film is that the pacing can sometimes seem jarring, with little connection to scenes preceding it, almost to the point of breaking the well crafted mood. Also, the climax was a bit too abrupt and a few more seconds of that final anguished scene would've done a lot to increase the film's overall impact.I'd still highly recommend ""Dead & Buried"", as a solid reminder of what imaginative and well made R rated horror used to be, before the parade of dull remakes and tamed to PG-13 bore fests that now clutter the genre.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWY5MGU3ODMtYzUxNi00ZDYxLWEzYjQtMWFjYTg4MDZmZmQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

With the help of a Thai-born Australian detective, Kham must take on all comers, including a gang led by an evil woman and her two deadly bodyguards.","178","Misconceptions","I have watched this movie several times and have come to a number of conclusions. The first is that 90% of the North American audience knows nothing about Asian films and more to the point, martial arts. Several other IMDb members commented on the repetitiveness of the movie, comparisons to Jackie Chan/Jet Li and its use of Kung Fu.First of all martial arts flicks will always be redundant to some extent since there are only so many ways to pick a fight, but stories do vary as does the quality of action. Tom Yum Goong is very similar to Ong Bak in its simplistic story and the noble feeling that surrounds Tony Jaa's character. Mind you in this movie Tony is much more violent and brutal to his enemies. His sorrow at the loss of the elephants is a big part of his rage and the simplicity of the story left lots of space for action. Perhaps left simple for international appeal or for the simple fact that a simple, pure story would be more poignant. Anyway, if you go to a martial arts flick looking to pick it apart and analyze the acting skills then your a fool and should never leave your American Hollywood watering hole.As to comparing Tony Jaa to Jackie Chan or Jet Li, are you insane?! Both Jackie and Jet are in their forties. Both are from China and went through actual training schools and academy's as well competitions. Wu Shu, Crane, Drunken Boxing etc... These are the styles these men made famous. Jackie built his comedic style from the ground up with his amazing acrobatic abilities, fighting skill and on screen charm. Now I'm not a Jackie Chan fan by any means, but credit where it is due. Jet Li was one of the youngest Chinese National Tournament winners ever and blew people away with his Tai Chi and Shaolin style Kung Fu.How does this relate to Tony Jaa? It doesn't at all and thats the point. Tony was very poor growing up in Thailand idolizing Bruce lee in the movies. He earned every break he has in his own way, and built his style accordingly. This movie is so amazing because it not just Kung Fu and Karate for the thousandth time. Tony is a master of Muay Thai Kickboxing, which he uses 80% of the movie. Now you don't even need to know anything about fighting to notice the difference between karate (or other styles) and Muay Thai. Through the diversity of his fighting style as he battles people who using everything from crane style Kung Fu to Capoeira, you understand why comparing him to others is unfair. While he has trained in similar martial arts its obvious that he is unique. He is in the best shape of his life and just now coming into his prime. His screen presence, skill and experience mean he could be as big or bigger than Jackie or Jet in the next ten years. At the very least he is going to be a major Thai action star for years.Also people keep in mind this is a Thai movie. Hollywood wouldn't even have finished the credits before they ran out of money if they worked with the same budget. More International success will give Tony Jaa access to a bigger budget, more talent (ie writers, language instructors, studios etc..) and allow him to grow. Its easy to bash but look at the low budget flicks Jackie Chan or any other martial artist made when they where twenty and you'll see that this movie is much much better than most.Remember it all just opinion people, everyones got one.

While some have substance, Gonzo Girl is a shallow and poorly written depiction of a novel based on a writer's experience as Hunter S. Thompson's assistant.The film's only redeeming quality is a knock-out performance by Willem Dafoe, and while I'm happy to watch him for two hours, I'd rather unearth the 1993 disaster that was Body of Evidence than sit through a film that pretends to be deep, artistic, and edgy, only to fail miserably at all three.Gonzo Girl is supposed to be about a young woman's journey into the writer's life as she takes an assistant writer's position, agreeing to help a much older man (fading literary star) work on the novel he's been avoiding. Yawn.Tropes aside, the film manages to do the exact opposite of what it intends, and instead of giving the young, female protagonist agency, follows her as she allows herself to be humiliated, exploited, and objectified.Perhaps the moral is that, just as writers are told to write what they know, filmmakers should make films about subjects they are familiar with. Otherwise you end up with Gonzo Girl: a Hollywood-ized piece of cinematic garbage that desperately wants to be illuminating and fails miserably.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjYwZDhkMTQtYjQ4ZS00NzJjLTgxMzUtNWE4MmI0M2M3MTJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAyMjQ3NzQ1._V1_UY209_CR139,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Joe Weider is a presented as a blemish-free altruist who only wants to help the world become a fitter place; various inconvenient aspects of Joe's private and professional lives - including the timing of his two marriages and the existence of his daughter, legal difficulties stemming from highly exaggerated claims of his products' effectiveness, questionable treatment of business partners, and strong presence in the gay-oriented ""beefcake magazine"" market of the 1950s and early 60s with titles like Adonis and Body Beautiful - are either glossed over or ignored completely. Meanwhile, the villainous foil ""Bill Hauk"", officially claimed to be a composite of several real-life characters but pretty clearly a representation of U.S. Olympic weightlifting coach and rival muscle mag publisher Bob Hoffman, is a cartoonishly evil, racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, violent thug. Exec produced by nephew Eric Weider, the film plays like the Weider Empire's bid for Joe's sainthood.Historical inaccuracies and omissions aside, as a movie it just isn't very satisfying. The years flip by so quickly it's difficult to build up much momentum, and we're often left wondering exactly how last year's big dilemma played out. Tyler Hoechlin as Joe does a capable job mimicking Weider's distinctive Polish/Yiddish/Quebecois accent but tacks on an awkwardly stilted manner of speech; oddly, both of these are absent in the always-classy Robert Forster's portrayal of Joe as an old man. The labored delivery combined with Joe's single-minded obsession with fitness makes him appear to be a sort of Rain Man of bodybuilding, and only succeeds in distancing the audience from the character. Repeated anti-Semitic attacks and accusations of homosexuality fail to build the viewer's sympathy after the first few instances, with a mounting array of epithets not heard for a while in a non-Tarentino movie.The film tries hard to present Joe Weider's life story as a classic David-versus-Goliath struggle. But given the ending we already know, it's pretty clear that this David's goal all along was to become an even bigger Goliath.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4Nzk0MzkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjgyMjQyNjM@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In his quest for spirituality and goodness, he is at odds with the materialism and obsession around him. The different layers of ""The Razor's Edge"" demand attention: Larry's physical desire for Isabel, a woman it turns out he doesn't even know; Isabel's cold-heartedness and desire to possess Larry; and Larry's search for the meaning of life, while the people he loves disintegrate around him from lack of values or hope. These are all seen through the eyes of Somerset Maugham, played by Marshall. Larry's final confrontation scene with Isabel (Tierney) about Sophie (Baxter) is bone-chilling -- Power, who had a tendency to be sometimes stiff and a bit removed from his material, uses that flaw to excellent advantage as Larry Darrell. It's not a showy role, but he's wonderful, and he's reading of poetry in Sophie's room is unforgettable.Highly recommended.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwMDA3MzMtODY4OC00NjkxLWIyNGQtMTVhOGY4Nzc5ZDI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Now here's the version no-one would have dreamed of ever seeing. The all-innocent victimised princess has been turned into a proud little brat who despises her step-mother from the very first time she sees her; the mean, scheming, mirror-gazing step-mother was changed into a lady doing her best to be accepted by her husband's intolerant daughter - only after miscarrying her son does she turn into the stereotype of evil; the adorable seven little dwarfs were metamorphosized into seven miners, some of whom really hate the girl.  Best of all the Prince charming has been erased and the silly ""Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?"" likewise. Anyway the film is a masterpiece from beginning to end - the highlights being the spells cast by the maddened step-mother.

A cute girl's photo ends up in his camera. He later sees the older Laura singing in a bar. He takes many more photos of her and ends seeing her again, wishing to help her career.","9","Kitsch 80's film that never ceases to charm me!","I've seen this film about five times now and I never cease to be delighted by its charms.Where do I start? Firstly Jon Cryer is truly excellent as the precocious adolescent amateur photographer who spouts sophisticated adult dialogue but is really naive on the romantic front. The way he blushes at the right moment is very credible. He plays the blushing virgin with gusto - we don't doubt for a moment that he's never had sex or kissed a girl.Firstly I must admit here to being a major fan of Demi Moore's films in the 80's. I've seen all of them from that period and I adore the characters she plays - Moore is what I call 'value added'. Whatever role she plays she brings something special, whether it is a brilliant range in temperament, downcast eyes, the husky voice, the tearful eyes the shiny hair. Most Hollywood actresses can't manage this, but Demi manages to be the girl next door and screen siren all in one.Anyway she plays this aspiring niteclub singer with bad taste in 80's clothes and even worse taste in music. To her credit she doesn't sing any of the songs as they were recorded by other people, so she just lip syncs along quite nicely. That song 'Hotheaded' is actually quite catchy in that Michael Bolton, Bar 'rawk' sort of way. Overall her character, Laura Victor comes over as a really likable human being. And the final scene at the airport is truly touching. Moore's says two simple words 'thank you' and we know she means it.Another to reason to love this film is that it was filmed entirely on location in San Francisco, and studio interiors are very few and far in between. Most of the shots are on real locations which adds to the movie's overall charm. This combined with the corny dialogue: that scene where she barges into the High School language laboratory dressed in a coctail waitress (read hooker!) outfit in very high heels and pulls Cryer out of the language lab is really funny - especially when she says ""F*** Off ez Vous"" to the French teacher.Some of the scenes are chauvinistic, including the one with frat boys and the hired hooker - which really doesn't have any relevance to the overall plot. And I agree with a previous poster who says that Cryer's on screen mother is one of the most irritating characters to appear in movies. That line about the sausage of Cryer's brother going cold is truly risible. When I watch this film I try very hard to ignore the flaws!This is corny, cheesy and highly entertaining. It really captures the spirit of the 80's. I'll never stop watching it - I love it.Bonus: watch out for Jennifer Tilly and Tim Robbins in bit parts playing Cryer's classmates. Robbins was 28 when he played this role. Teenage high school student he ain't! But it's still good to see him in this. Also the very catchy song 'Eiffel Tower' by Malcolm McClaren and the McClarenettes.Moore wears some wacky clothes and has that 80's penchant for long evening gloves with hundreds of bangles, very Material Girl! I love that cabin on the boardwalk apartment she lives in while working at Jakes's as a singer.

It's badness is epic. It is hard to know where to begin in terms of describing the experience of Solarbabies, but one could start by saying that a central episode involves a chase scene of children dramatically escaping from a futuristic special-forces police force by ROLLER SKATING through the DESERT. I am not making this up.The completely random plot and incredulously goofy bonding/friendship scenes between the child-prisoners and their glowing-ball alien friend could only have been the product of coked-out brainstorming sessions of Hollywood types in the 80s.Are children lovable prisoners of a Nazi-Fetish, post-apocalyptic corporation/government agency that inexplicably decides to profit by running a child-labor camp in the desert? Check. Are the children also forced to play an arena sport involving roller skates? Check. Does a glowing alien ball appear randomly and befriend the children, with no apparent connection to anything else in the film? Check. Do the children breakdance with the glowing alien ball-friend? Check. Does the glowing alien ball require the children to escape the prison and go on a quest? Yep. Do the children ""escape"" simply by roller-skating away from the ""prison"" (through a desert)? Um, yes. Does the glowing alien ball-friend require the children to join hands in a ritualized new-age circle of friendship/love in order to achieve its full glowing alien ball powers? You betcha.If this movie were any better, I would give it one star. But it charges so far past the normal constraints of the badness boundaries that it comes out on the other side and emerges as something that is actually pretty entertaining and fairly compelling. The bar starts out low, but the filmmakers just keep on lowering it, going way past the zero point, and actually discovering new ways to make a bad movie worse. It is like art in reverse.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMTQxNTQ0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE0MjI3NA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Everything in it is a cliche of a copy of a cliche in the worst possible meaning of it. The plot, that is trivial and still illogical and dumb, the predictably stupid actions of characters and interactions between them, for gods sake even the nicknames of characters, which were a total cliche, but moreover still don't make any sense in this movie - all these things make you puke and constant feeling of Spanish shame and pain from facepalming make the experience even worse.Watching this movie is a total waste of time, money and brain sells. The story doesn't devellope throughout the movie... I mean if you could call it a story. The characters also don't develop in any way and behave like bots for an 8-bit game - no logic, no rational or emotional justification - they just to what they do. The rules of the world, although being silly and illogical from the very beginning, change from scene to scene with ease, just to fit the current scene. And just really the worst cliche every other minute, like for example a group of heros, being chased by a monster and spitting ""aaahhh we need to hurry!"" every second, suddently stops to discuss some irrelevant bullcrap for the next 10 minutes.The only reason to watch this movie could be only if you're making a list of the worst movies of all ages.

The bloody crime caused a stir on both sides of the Atlantic and remains one of the most memorable American Tragedies...","58","That of a Mother","When I was growing up, my mother could be a little over involved in my life but she's got nothing on Barbara Baekeland (Julianne Moore). SAVAGE GRACE tells Barbara's story and that of her incalculable influence on the direction of her very tight family. Together, Barbara, Brooks (Stephen Dillane) and Tony (Barney Clark as a boy, Eddie Redmayne as an adult), exist in a tiny bubble where they can be seen by and perform for the rest of the world but ultimately exist solely for each other. Rich beyond their own comprehension, the Baekeland's exude an air of arrogance and thrive on the act of acting. And even though, as the years pass on, the friends, acquaintances and passersby will have run far away, the Baekeland's still have us.The Baekeland's come from money. Well, at least Brooks does. His father was the inventor of Bakelite, a popular plastic. Barbara, a former model and almost famous actress, married into the fortune and it suited her just fine to do nothing but be seen. With no real drama to occupy their time, the Baekeland's must create their own and they become experts in the craft. And like the entirely selfish parents they are, they teach their young son, Tony, everything they know. First time feature filmmaker and brave soul, Tom Kalin, tells their revolting yet tragic story in a manner that neither glorifies nor condemns their demented ways. All the while though, he centers his attention on Tony so that we never forget who the real victim is. This makes it all the more deplorable when Tony abandons reason to embrace his family heritage.SAVAGE GRACE is not for all. Make no mistake, when I say that the Baekeland's ruin each other and bring about all of their own misfortune, I am not speaking lightly. This is a family that shares baths, beds and lovers. Kalin is mindful of his audience's likely discomfort but also never afraid to show that audience the dirty details. Besides, when all the debauchery becomes too much to handle, one can always look to Moore and bask in her brilliance. Moore is flippant one moment and affected the next. Her performance is so delicately balanced between calculated control and callous chaos that one never knows which way she'll turn and one is always shocked to find out. Both Dillane (who is practically unrecognizable) and Redmayne (who could so easily be related to Moore in reality with his pale, freckled skin) do more than simply hold their own. They complete the trio and it is a delight to watch them play off of each other, albeit a disturbing delight.Kalin has not only crafted an engaging film but also a bizarre experience. If you can stomach this true story, then you will be treated to a frankness that is not common in American cinema. You will also get to spend time in dark places you may not be accustomed to. However, when you inevitably arrive safely on the other side, you will know the drastic differences in what it means to be fortunate.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyNjYwNjgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTEzNDk2MQ@@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It clearly got snubbed and I guess we'll never know why. The only reason I can fathom is the academy's fear of the Ice man's Day-glo clashing with the red carpet. Clearly the better solution would have been a Day-glo carpet.Maybe I'm a little biased because I see so much of myself in Ice's character and the personal journey he embarks on in the film.

And if that minute and a half comes early in life, how far into adulthood can you carry it with you, and when does a healthy memory become an obsession that finally blurs the line between reality and fantasy?  `The Fan,' directed by Tony Scott and starring Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes, is an intense and disturbing motion picture that examines that moment and the effects it can have on the lives of those either directly or indirectly involved.  Here, the focus is on one Gil Renard (De Niro), a knife salesman in San Francisco and a die-hard Giants fan who is pumped about the acquisition during the off-season of superstar centerfielder Bobby Rayburn (Snipes), whom he believes will bring a pennant to the team.  Once a player himself-- a pitcher-- Renard's life has since been on a downhill slide.  Divorced, he has a young, little league aged son, Richie (Andrew J. Ferchland), with whom he has an unsettling relationship, and at work, his sales have been so poor his job is on the line.  An angry, disturbed individual, Renard has reached a pivotal point in his life; for inspiration, he continually returns to the philosophies of the catcher from his playing days, Coop (Charles Hallahan), whom he considers one of the finest athletes he ever knew.  And as his life continues to deteriorate, his obsessions begin to add further to the imbalance of his perceptions of reality, which finally lead him past a point of no return.	Scott's film, of course, has less to do with baseball than it does with how the game itself actually relates to life and the things that really matter. As Rayburn says at one point, `We're not curing cancer here.'  But to those to whom life has been reduced to that minute and a half to which they still cling, the game can be everything.  And it is just that unhealthy obsession that Scott examines in this film, that comparatively insignificant moment that in the obsessive mind becomes an episode of monumental importance that finally distorts any semblance of reality the individual may have left. What's truly frightening is that upon close scrutiny, in Renard there is much with which many viewers will be able to relate in one way or another: The anger, the frustration and perhaps the inability to let go of that minute and a half, even when it threatens to become more than just a pleasant memory, but an unhealthy lifeline to another place and another time that, in reality, may never have existed in the first place.  It's like a search for self-esteem by the has-been-who-never-was, who can neither realize nor accept it's elusiveness.  As Renard says to Richie, `Baseball is better than life, because it's fair.  You hit a sacrifice fly and it doesn't count against your average.'  An ideal that has forever eluded Renard; in his life, he's never been able to `give himself up for the team' and get anything in return for it.	As Renard, De Niro gives an explosive performance that at first glance may seem to have a bit of Travis Bickle and Max Cady in it-- which in fact it does-- though upon closer inspection, Renard is a unique character.  Those with a disturbed mind may have traits in common, as these characters De Niro has portrayed certainly do; but De Niro has successfully given each of them an individual personality, and when viewed side by side, the differences are readily apparent.  Bickle may be a sociopath, Cady a cold blooded killer; but Renard is a man who was just never able to get a handle on his life and has allowed his obsessions to dictate the choices he has made along the way. De Niro is simply a master of his craft, with the ability to make his characters so real that a performance like this one is often overlooked; this is Oscar worthy work for which he never received the acclaim he was due.  His Renard is so like someone you would run into in your everyday life that in retrospect, it's scary.  But it's the kind of performance we've come to expect from De Niro, and as usual, he does not disappoint.	Wesley Snipes, as well, gives a solid performance as Rayburn that is one of his best ever, which is not surprising when you consider with whom he was working.  If you study De Niro's films, you may discover a common thread running through them with regard to his co-stars.  De Niro has the ability to make those with whom he is working better; and it's something that stays with them forever after.  Consider Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep before `The Deer Hunter,' or Ed Harris before `Jacknife.'  Certainly they were exceptional talents before, but they have arguably been better since. And Snipes is no exception.  Nor is Benicio Del Toro (Recipient of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for `Traffic'), who gives a memorable turn here as Rayburn's rival outfielder, Juan Primo.  	The supporting cast includes Patti D'Arbanville (Ellen),Ellen Barkin (Jewel), John Leguizamo (Manny), Chris Mulkey (Tim), Dan Butler (Garrity) and Brandon Hammond (Sean).  A thought provoking thriller that gives some real insight into the cause and effect of the psyche of human nature, `The Fan' is like an open wound that may hit too close to home for some.  And to dismiss this as just a `baseball' movie or another `action' flick would be a mistake, for there is much more here than meets the eye.  In the end, those who pay attention will ultimately reap the rewards it proffers.  I rate this one 9/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFlN2VjNjYtZDdjOS00ZGI3LTg1MWQtZTBhNmRjNDFiZDE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

German high school girls in the 1970's were evidently about twenty years old on the average, and the ones that were overweight, unattractive, or just didn't look good in mini-skirts or short-shorts were apparently expelled from school. These girls were ALL obsessed with sex and talked constantly in sexual double-entendres. They took lots of long, hot group showers where they spent a lot of time soaping each other up. And they threw themselves at pretty much anything in pants regardless of age, gender, or attractiveness.This movie dispenses with the usual documentary pretensions and focuses on a group of overage ""schulmadchen"" riding on a bus on their way to camp and telling each other stories about their sexual escapades. The stories/vignettes are less sordid than those in some of the other films in the series, but they're also more pedestrian (and boring). One girl has become pregnant by her boyfriend (yawn). Another girl had an affair with her father's boss to save his job (a little more interesting). In the most ridiculous story two girls try to score some action for their repressed and virginal, but absolutely gorgeous, female teacher (who no man apparently ever tried to hit on before--yeah, right). The best story though involves two cousins who are skinny-dipping when a horny fisherman spies them and takes their clothes. He ends up chasing the two butt-naked nymphs through the woods, big boobs a-bouncin', until they run into two boys their own age who take care of the the lecherous fisherman, but exact their own tribute, which the two girls are naturally only too willing to provide. . .Eventually the bus actually arrives at camp, and everyone takes a long, hot shower together, and then various girls take turns throwing themselves at the one handsome male chaperon--poor guy. (If it wasn't for the 1974 release date, and the fact that there are no virgins in sight, I'd swear this part of the film was a rip-off of the American Kristy McNichol-Tatum O'Neal camp-site classic ""Little Darlings""). Anyway, stupid as it is, this movie certainly succeeds as sexploitation. It may disappoint the hardcore perverts out there that these actresses are not remotely believable as actual ""schulmadchen"", but they are definitely a vast improvement over the silicone-enhanced porn-skanks you'd find in films like this today.

At first I thought perhaps it was going to be one of those 'twin' double-cross films where these two girls used this older wealthy man for all his money. I was wrong. Similar to the title of this film, this is a film about passions and desires. It divulges in the emotion of obsession, and the reaction a man can have on someone that he desperately and sexually desires. Mathieu is our possible victim in this story. While both are not the most interesting characters (both have flaws and troubles), they do provide some structured characters. Mathieu is willing to give up everything for this woman that he hardly knows, but is physically attracted to her. It is hard to say that he loves her, but he does lust for her. The dual role of Conchita in this film is used for two purposes. The first is as a distraction, while the second is emotion. Both Conchitas are different in their own way and are used to push forward the story. Whenever Bunuel needed to convey a different emotion, he would bring in the actress that best represented that emotion. At first it was confusing, but as the film progressed you began to see less and less separate actresses, but instead as one character. It is impressive how Bunuel created this illusion.As I mentioned above, there were two devises that I have never seen in a movie before. I explained above about the use of two women for one female role, but the second is a bit subtler. I briefly mentioned it above about how these two women (one character) were used to distract. If you pay attention to the film terrorism is a big part of the universe surrounding Mathieu. While he pines continually for Conchita, the world around him is falling apart. Bombings and deaths are at an all time high, yet he doesn't really seem to notice this. He is so caught up in Conchita that it seems like nothing else exists. He is oblivious to his surroundings. In fact, I would go so far as to say that we are also oblivious to the surroundings. Bunuel does this job of keeping our eye focused on the interchanging women that we sometimes forget or miss the actions surrounding this film. I believe that Bunuel is trying to prove the point that obsession does obscure your vision. It blurs your eyes and forces you to miss crucial elements of your surroundings. It isn't until the end when we are reminded violently of the truth surrounding our characters. I felt that Bunuel was slapping me in the face with that final scene. I had nearly forgotten myself of the terrorism outside, but easily he reminded me. This was a spectacular film that really opened my eyes to a completely new way of film-making. It reminded me of some of the early works of another favorite director of mine Francois Ozon. Both of these talented artists have their own way of creating a world and an emotion, and both do it with some of the most beautiful strokes of their mechanical brush. I would recommend this film to anyone that is willing to experience radical, yet provocative film-making at its best. You will be impressed.I cannot wait to include this film in my collection to watch over and over again. Thanks to Criterion, they have provided a beautiful packaging to this obscure film.Grade: ***** out of *****","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGQzZGQxZTctMzE2Mi00OGFiLTg2ZjQtZTAwYzMyMjExN2JiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

After having his portrait done, Dorian Gray, under the influence of the eloquent Lord Henry Wotton, wishes for the picture to age instead of him so that he may be blessed with eternal youth. After the death of his wife-to-be, Dorian embarks on a life of pleasure and sins, which don't affect the man in the slightest, but leaves it mark on the portrait which descends into a horrid impression of the handsome young man it's portraying...This film is fantastically well put together. The acting, directing and writing are all stellar, which make this film one pleasant viewing indeed. The real plaudits for this movie, however, go to the writer of the original novel; Oscar Wilde. The story itself is ingenious. Of course, the idea of selling one's soul had been done before (the German legend, Faust, springs to mind instantly), but never in this way. The portrait itself is a genius idea and it allows us to see the man and the sin as different things. However, through it's ending; it also allows the audience to see that the two are linked, and overall giving a good commentary on body, soul and sin. The story has obvious themes of vanity and the lust for eternal youth entwined within it, both of which are sins in themselves. The main character of Dorian Gray is a man that is a victim of influence, and we can feel for him in that way; but he's also an ugly sinner on the inside, making the audience hate him. This is a strange situation for an audience to be in, and in the end; all that's left for him is indifference.The film moves slowly, but this is definitely to it's advantage as it allows us to get to know the characters, and if it wasn't for that the horror wouldn't be able to work as it needs our emotional impact to function. The horror in the story is rather subdued, but this is one of the most horrific tales ever told. I think most people will agree that this kind of horror - the brooding, personal kind - is much more horrifying than anything that men with knives and any amount of jumpy moments can muster.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2E4NTM1MTUtNjhiZS00NzE3LWI0ZjItMTU5ZDQ3YjBjYjU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTEwNDcxNDc@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This sets off complications that involve her whole family-her fiery sister (Kyra Sedgwick), gruff father (Robert Duvall) and understanding mother (Gena Rowlands).This plot has been done many times before and there are no real surprises--but it has a good pro-female script.  That's no surprise--it was written by Callie Khouri who also wrote ""Thelma & Louise"".  The dialogue is sharp and adult and the stars give it their all.I've never really been a big fan of Roberts but she is very good here faking a credible Southern accent.  She has a GREAT scene when she confronts her club about her husband's infidelity.  Sedgwick is just fantastic as her sister--full of fire and having a great time.  Surprisingly Rowlands wasn't that good at first--way too muted but she eventually got better and is wonderful in a scene in which she tells off Duvall.  Quaid and Duvall are lousy in their roles...but they're given NOTHING to work with--this picture is about the women.  The only male character with any depth is Jamie (Brett Cullen)--very handsome, intelligent and caring--a real great performance.  A word of advice--this movie is VERY R rated.

You don't know what it's like.","I don't think I will ever understand the disappointing backlash against this film. What I witnessed was not your typical ""western"" film full of passionate love and implausible events. Instead, what I saw was beautifully captured images, powerful acting by Damon and Thomas, a story that twisted further down a darkened rabbit hole than I was expecting, and this challenging character study that gave us a brief insight to a world that will never be seen by our eyes again. This was not the romantic film that it was marketed as, this was not the adventure that it was marketed as, but instead it was the story of one character and the tribulations that effect him on his journey into the real world. It is the story of a very compassionate man that sees the honest darkness of those around him and must face the consequences of his actions. It showcases amazing acting that may be a bit disturbing for the unfamiliar eye, but to me was nothing short of brilliant. Billy Bob successfully adapted the story from the page, but it was not the film that he wanted. Miramax butchered this film in the marketing aspect, which ultimately hurt it overall. I will never understand why this did not receive the praise it should have, but will never be ashamed to bring it out for friends and family to enjoy. This film was like finding a dollar in the couch, an unexpected surprise that keeps a smile on your face the rest of the day.I have read several reviews that just completely dismantle Damon's acting in this film. While his accent does fade in and out randomly, it is the way that he carries himself and reacts to the situations that unfold before him that really showcase the true acting ability of this star. While I do not think that Bennifer has made the best choices to challenge his career, Damon continually proves that he has the ability to be a force in Hollywood. This film alone proves it. He built this beautiful chemistry between him and Cruz that teetered on fear and sorrow. He showed his compassion towards Blevins and Lacey continually throughout the film showing that his idea of friendship was stronger than anyone expected. His strength and will shined brightly when he was ultimately faced with death. These are all moments where other actors would have cheapened it up and tried to fake the audience instead of showing the truth. I thought Damon showed us honesty, he showed us a part of him that I was not expecting. If you couldn't tell already, he really impressed me. But yet so did everyone else in this film. I honestly thought that the kid from Sling Blade, Lucas Black, would never work again, and I was skeptical of him in this film, but he was exceptional. He took us away from his character in Sling Blade and built a whole new name for himself. He took the challenges of this character and pushed them out of the television. The same can be said for Henry Thomas that continues to impress me with his ability to capture his moments and make them so real. Finally, Billy Bob did a great job of casting the rest of this film to bring the images and feelings of the time period to light. I could feel the dusty world of Texas and Mexico through the smaller characters that he cast.Speaking of Billy Bob, could we not agree that these actors wouldn't have been half as good if it were not for the amazing direction behind the camera. I wish that I could have seen his version of the film instead of the choppy Miramax version. He has a very gifted eye, and while sometimes he takes roles that I think blur that eye, he always seems to rebound with a very riveting performance. He is constantly experimenting with genres and styles, and this film shows that he can break traditional boundaries. The images that he captured on film help create this darkness that surrounded our main characters. The scene with the thunderstorm I thought was beautiful, as was the rolling Mexican landscape. He places us into the film as more than just observers, and that is a sign of a great director.Finally, I would like to pose the question of why Grady was so infatuated with Blevins? There were several moments during the film where he could have simply walked away from the boy, and Lacey even suggested it continually, but they always stayed with him. I realize that a main reason may be to develop the plot, but I think there was a more symbolic meaning. I feel that Damon connected with the boy because they had a kindred spirit. Damon was this passive, controlled character that never really understood himself until later on in the film, while Blevins was this wild-hair that never controlled himself or thought about his decisions. It was as if they were polar opposites, but yet they were perfectly matched. I think Damon liked him because it was what he aspired to be. I sometimes felt that the secondary characters were not real, and sometimes they were just imaginary images of what Damon wanted himself to be more like. This thought created a much darker picture for me that forced this film to go deeper into my mind and be more enjoyable than I thought.Overall, I really liked this film. While others will definitely disagree, I thought that the acting, story, and especially the direction deserved more attention that what was handed to it.

Of course, Goldie's Molly McGrath meets the obvious resentments from high school boys that you would expect finding out their new coach is a woman, but she does eventually win them over, even at the risk of losing custody of her two daughters to her uptight ex-husband (James Keach). Nothing new or inventive here but Goldie lights up the screen presenting a smart yet flawed character trying to live her dream. Nipsey Russell has one of the best roles of his career as the principal of the school that hires her and there are some very funny moments provided by the members of the team, especially Woody Harrelson, Nick Corri, and in a star-making turn, a very young Wesley Snipes. Bruce McGill scores as a sexist coach from the opposing school, Prescott and Jan Hooks has some cute moments as GOldie's ex-husband's new girlfriend.

It's funny, even hilarious; it has mystery and action; and it features brilliant performances by the always-reliable Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan. It's also not a movie that wallows in treacly messages, and it's not a movie that uses sports as a crutch for ""finding one's inner strength."" In short, it's a wonderful, top-notch movie.Giamatti plays Mike Flaherty, a small-time lawyer who's running low on cash. He moonlights as coach of the local high-school team, which is, to put it bluntly, terrible. In a burst of fiscal sanity, Mike offers to become legal guardian for Leo, one of his clients (played by the crusty Burt Young), who's just been declared legally incapacitated. Why? Because as his guardian, Mike gets $1500 a month. But since he wants to avoid the extra hassle of actually taking care of Leo, he puts him in a nice home. Seriously, it's a nice home, with nice people and a big flat-screen TV.At this point, the movie wants us on Mike's side Ã¢ÂÂ sort of. He needs the cash, and he doesn't really want to tell his wife Jackie (Ryan) that they're running low, not with two young daughters to care for as well. Plus he's coach of a terrible team and is just swimming in stress. Swimming in it. So much so that while jogging to work off the stress, he suffers a panic attack.Just when Mike thinks some of his problems have been solved, teenage Kyle (Alex Shaffer) walks into his life. Kyle, it turns out, his Leo's grandson, and they've never met. Kyle's been sent by his mom to visit Leo. At first, this complicates things Ã¢ÂÂ especially when Kyle seems awfully reluctant to go back home to Ohio Ã¢ÂÂ but then Mike's remaining big problem is solved. It turns out the kid is a gifted wrestler. Who'd have thought that? He looks scrawny, but in practices Kyle shows he has the mettle. And thus things are riding well for Mike.But this would be a truly dull (if inspirational) movie if things continued to ride well. One thing we learn early on is that Mike intentionally misled the judge in Leo's case, giving the impression that he would be actively taking care of Leo. But things really get going when Kyle's druggie mom (Melanie Lynskey) shows up to bring her boy back Ã¢ÂÂ and to take over as Leo's guardian.Too often, Giamatti has played real sad-sack characters, guys who just can't seem to catch a break, guys who suffer at the hands of fickle fate. Not so here. Mike isn't exactly a conniving mastermind, but he's not an idiot, either, and he deals with each situation with logic and reason, even as they spiral further out of his control. It's a typically masterful Giamatti performance, and for once he's not a total loser who's in over his head. He's even a half-decent coach who simply has a lackluster team to work with.Giamatti's not alone, though. I really got a kick out of Amy Ryan's performance as his somewhat-exasperated spouse Jackie, who's not terribly fond of suddenly having a teenage boy around at first. A few years back, Ryan turned in an Oscar-nominated performance as a native Bostonian in Gone Baby Gone. Ryan had a thick, believable Boston accent then. Here, she's playing a New Jersey native, but at no point does she go overboard with the Jersey Shore dialect. That's what good actresses can do Ã¢ÂÂ they can dial it back when they have to and show a little nuance.Win Win is not a stand-up-and-cheer movie, although the audience at the screening I attended applauded when it was over. It's not a crime drama, and it doesn't really have a lot of twists to its plot. What makes it work are all of the truly sincere, dead-on performances: by Giamatti, Ryan, Shaffer, Lynskey, Bobby Cannavale, and even Jeffrey Tambor as one of Mike's wrestling assistant coaches. Not a sour note in the bunch, everyone at the top of his or her game.This might have fared well, critically, if it were released during awards season. It sort of reminded me of last year's Greenburg, starring Ben Stiller, only funnier and sweeter. Win Win is a charming, quiet movie that reminds us that, as the Grateful Dead once told us, once in a while you can get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNTgzNjY4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTcwMjI0NA@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It was so bad, I could hardly believe what I was seeing. There are no characters, just a few stereotypes wandering around and getting killed. The extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation, and that's about it. There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes just began on their own, coming from nowhere with a pounding techno track. While I was watching this movie I kept asking ""Where is this happening? What's going on?"" The acting was high school drama quality, with stiff wooden delivery, as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines. Their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design. ADR sounded like it was recorded in an open room. The actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks, looking almost robotic in their movements. So, these listless automatons are whisked through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios, often without even the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they're there.

There was ""Die Hard on a Ship"" (""Under Siege""), ""Die Hard on a Train"" (""Under Siege 2""), and ""Die Hard on a Bus"" (""Speed""), just to name a few. ""Sudden Death"" can be described as either ""Die Hard on the Ice"", ""Die Hard at a Hockey Game"" or ""Die Hard in an Arena"". You pick. Technically you could put all three titles into this movie and it'll still be pretty much the same thing. However, ""Sudden Death"" is one of the better ""Die Hard"" clones. It's an exciting movie about terrorists taking over the Pittsburgh Civic Arena where the decisive seventh game of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Chicago Blackhawks is being played. However there's a little difference here. The only people who know that hostages have taken over are the people in the VIP box (which includes the Vice President), the Secret Service men outside the arena, and an arena fire marshall who's two little kids are attending the game. The 17,000-plus fans attending the game have no idea whats really going on. That fire marshall is played by Belgian action star Jean-Claude Van Damme. I've not been a big fan of Van Damme's films, but ""Sudden Death"" is easily his best movie to date. Van Damme plays Darren McCord, the fire marshall who finds out something's wrong when his little daughter is taken to the VIP box as a hostage after witnessing a killing. When McCord finds out what's going on, he does precisely what Bruce Willis did in ""Die Hard"", takes on the terrorists all by himself. The lead bad guy is portrayed by Powers Boothe in a frightening performance. He may not be quite as effective as Alan Rickman's villain in ""Die Hard"", but Boothe does a good job at being mean. Van Damme is also very good too (especially in one scene where he poses as the Penguins goalie to hide out from the bad guys who were chasing him). He's much better here than he was in ""Timecop"", teaming again with ""Timecop"" director Peter Hyams. The action scenes are splendid (both the gunplay and the action during the game), and the suspense has you on the edge.

Rome's police records list fourteen citations in six years, from public nuisance to several violent assaults. In May of 1606 he murdered a friend, one Ranuccio Tomassoni in a sword fight. Added to these lurid details, his sexual interests show that he freely drifted from the Vatican's ordained model. This makes Caravaggio an interesting person, but a highly complex candidate for a biographic investigation on film.While Derek Jarman's film captures (with delightful conceit) many of the surface details of Caravaggio's life, it's a work of startling genius because it succeeds on a far more profound level. Jarman tells the story of Caravaggio rather like Caravaggio would paint, infusing it (effortlessly) with the central themes of his life's deepest convictions, creating a portrait which reflects the subject and the artist with equal relevance. What's more, many of the same themes that have been identified with both artists - sexuality, transcendence, violence, censorship, politics (religious/sexual) and the tumultuous source of creative identity are present in both men. It works as very few films do. This is also an unusually accessible film for Derek Jarman. The performances are entertaining and it's filmed with astounding beauty and simplicity. This film is a masterpiece.However, because of it's homosexual themes and personal tone, ""Caravaggio"" is likely to be appreciated only by those viewers who weary of film as simple diversion and long for something more challenging. This is a powerful artistic statement, but it flew under the radar during a decade of British film-making where ""Gandhi"", ""Chariots of Fire"" and ""A Room With A View"" represented the best of what was being made. While those films are great in their way, this film value is greater in terms of bravura and personal expression. See it if you can.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTM3Y2RhZTctOGFlYi00YWFlLTg1MTctOTE1YmJlYjBlYzVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I sat through the entire 9 and a half hours in one sitting.Shoah surprised me in several ways. The first was how the interviews were conducted. Lanzmann is a very direct and aggressive interviewer and initially, I was very put off by how he delved into his subjects. He seemed almost wreckless and completely devoid of empathy as he continued to ask the most personal and private questions, never hesitating to force his subjects to think back to what was not only the darkest moment of their lives, but the darkest moments of modern Western history.Eventually, what happens however, is astonishing. Most interviewees eventually give up their resistance, and very carefully relate their stories. Lanzmann forces them to consider details. How many bodies per furnace? How wide was the ditch? How far was the train ramp from the camp's bunkers? These details facilitate memory and soon, the subjects open up in the most remarkable way.No matter how you feel, or what you think you know about the Holocaust, this film puts faces to the tragedy in a way few conventional documentaries could. The emphasis here is on memory and oral history.As one Holocaust victim says early in the film, ""It might be good for you to talk about these things. But for me, no."" Eventually however, he realizes he must bear witness.There's one remarkable scene where Lanzmann confronts German settlers in Poland about the previous owner of their home, who were Jewish and sent to Auschwitz after their properties were confiscated.People who don't find this film 'entertaining' or perhaps 'boring' probably feel that way because, outside of the immediate experiences of the subjects being interviewed, there is no wider context to present the events. A worthwhile companion to this film would be the BBC's Auschwitz: Inside The Nazi State which runs 4 and a half hours, but will help you understand Shoah better.The other thing I found fascinating about this film was how the translations actually helped you absorb what is being said in a way direct subtitling wouldn't. For instance, most of the subjects speak German or Polish. Lanzmann speaks French mainly and some German. His translator translates what's being said into French and then the subtitles translate the French into English. By being able to look into the eyes of the people speaking, in their own native language, and then read the subtitles, was a very subtle, but very effective tool that deadens the 'shock value' of what is being spoken and gives the viewer more time to absorb the content.Some people have complained also that the film also has many long takes, which are seemingly of nothing. For instance, Lanzmann lets his camera linger on the remnants of Chelmno, which was razed after the war. Although it just looks like a five minute shot of a field, what struck me was how different this bucolic field must have been in 1942. Making this connection justifies every frame shot. Lanzmann, however, will not force this down your throat. You must be patient.This is an astonishing film that must be seen by everyone, at least once. Please review the general historical context of the Holocaust before you see it, to get the most out of it, but otherwise, this is living testament of the most vital kind.Brilliant, essential film-making.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyMTI3NzYxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM5ODQxNA@@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

""Hounds of Love"" is about serial sexual homicide, and it is as brutal as that sounds. Not in an exploitative manner (most of the cruelty is off screen), but in its believable depiction of perversion, and the matter of fact execution by the monsters.Sporting a cheesy mustache, Curry presents a tiny, unassuming wimp - he is humiliated and berated about money owing. Yet deep inside he is a tight wound ball of explosion, and the creepy manipulator of all crimes. Evelyn is a more than wiling accomplice, but she has a wounded past, shows some semblance of sympathy, and is thus the weak link in the monster couple.

This could be the female version of that movie although not as entertaining and without all the technical achievements. It is also a little more subtle in its approach. The story begins on a train as re-known actress, Maria Enders (Juliette Binoche) is heading to Zurich with her personal assistant, Valentine (Kristen Stewart) to receive an award on behalf of a dear friend, Wilhelm Melchior, who is the reason why she is now a famous actress. Twenty years ago, he offered her the role to play the lead character in the stage and later on in the film adaptation of that play. On their way to Zurich they receive the terrible news of his passing which deeply saddens her. After the ceremony Valentine arranged a meeting with Klaus (Lars Eidinger) who wants Maria to play the older character in his adaptation of Wilhelm's novel. She continues to identify with the strong younger character and doesn't feel its correct for her to play the weaker role of Helen, but ultimately she agrees to do it. The lead character will be played by the promising young actress Jo-Ann Ellis (Chloe Grace Moretz) who has had her share of scandals with paparazzi's recently. In order to prepare for the role, Maria and Valentine travel to Wilhelm's former home in Sils Maria surrounded by the gorgeous Alps. Here, Maria is forced to reflect on her career and come to terms with the fact that she's an aging actress. Clouds of Sils Maria is another film that reminds us that life imitates art because we are always finding ways to express ourselves and the means to do so is through art. Maria is forced to come to terms with her reality through the acceptance of this character she's not thrilled about playing because she doesn't seem to understand her. There are several scenes in which she is rehearsing the lines with Valentine that kind of blur the line between fantasy and reality. There were moments in which i didn't know if they were actually arguing or if they were simply reading the lines of the play. Those scenes were memorable and unique and I believe are at the center of this film. There are also some great conversations between the two about art and blockbuster Hollywood movies portraying the opposing two point of views. The film is rich with strong female characters exploring art and life in a rather authentic way. Clouds of Sils Maria may not be for everyone because it is slow paced and some scenes can become tedious if you aren't a patient viewer, but I found it a rewarding experience and a solid exploration of the passage of time and coming to terms with it. The classical music score (Pachelbel's Canon in D Major) also gives the film a touch of class. The scenery is also beautiful and it makes each conversation all the more profound.Juliette Binoche has always been a wonderful actress so it comes as no surprise that she deliver yet another solid and touching performance. The real question everyone had was whether or not Kristen Stewart could hold her own next to this talented actress. The two share a lot of screen time together and at no point did I feel that Binoche was eating up the screen. Stewart gives in my opinion the best performance of her career (and I did really like her in Camp X-Ray and Still Alice) and she truly shines here. She won the Cesar (France's version of the Oscars) for best supporting screenplay and she proves that with the right material she can deliver solid roles. Chloe Grace Moretz also delivers a strong performance despite not having much screen time. She's hilarious in the scenes where Maria looks up her name on the internet and we get clips of the scandals she's been involved in. All in all, this is a solid film exploring some interesting subjects with solid performances and a beautiful landscape. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwMTg3MDE0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQ1ODQyNTE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Mine is this one. I just love this film.It is only one out of over 5,000 movies have either rented or purchased that I watched back-to-back nights after seeing it for the first time. A dozen viewings later, It's still just as good, if not better. It is, start-to-finish, the most entertaining crime movie I have ever watched.Being of fan of film noir, those wonderfully-narrated crime films of the '40s and '50s, Romeo Is Bleeding is right up my alley. I may be wrong but believe this whole film is simply a parody of the film noirs: an outrageous take on those movies with an over-the-top villain (Lena Olin, the most fascinating female I have ever come across on film), along with over-the-top characters, action scenes, dialog and narration. It's a wild, fun - albeit sick - ride, not to be taken seriously (which a lot of people did and then thought it was too goofy). Evidence of this film-noir spoof is in the dialog, with a number of fantastic dark-humor lines, many delivered by Olin. One has to see this a number of times to catch all the humor in here. Kudos to screenplay writer Hilary Henkin for her work.Oldman is superb and its the glue that holds this unique story in tact. His narration, including the exaggerated inflection in his voice, is fantastic. I appreciate the American accent this British actor used, too. Olin, as Russian hit- woman Mona Demarkoff, she is one character I guarantee you will not ever forget. Roy Scheider, Annabella Sciorra, Juliette Lewis, Michael Wincott and others - cameos by Dennis Farina and Ron Perlman - all deliver great performances with lines that, well,....as I said, are outrageous.

I live in northeastern Pennsylvania, only 5 minutes away from Harford, and only 25 minutes away from Dimock(where the documentary Gasland was based). I have seen the effects of hydrofracking, both the negative and what little positive comes of it(but those facts and feelings are for another discussion). As sad as it may seem, natural gas and well drilling companies(to go un-named ONLY in this review) bought their way into the community with false hope, money, and lies, but not necessarily as it happened in the film. In reality.... it was even worse. Barbecues, parties, etc. were even thrown in order to gain fans and friends... The community's spirit and resilience was conveyed correctly, though in reality, it gained support too late.All in all, even if political/social/ecological issues regarding hydrofracking aren't your forte, this film is a quality film that is captivating and deserves to have personal opinions set aside and enjoyed for its quality.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNDYzNzgyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTU0NTI1OA@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I've been lucky enough to see it on the big screen several times at revival houses, and each time I was blown away. Day of the Locust is a dark, compelling, amusing, bitter epic that's really more about America itself as filtered through the lens of Hollywood at its first creative height, in the 1930s.What makes the movie, beyond the writing and direction, is its cast, and many of the supporting actors here create indelible characters. Why Karen Black didn't remain a superstar after this decade is a mystery, especially after this film -- in which she proves that she could act the hell out of a role. And how can you not like a film in which Billy Barty plays a foul-mouthed alcoholic (the first character we meet in the book), Burgess Meredith is a hapless door-to-door salesman, Natalie ""Lovey"" Shafer is the madam of a high-class whorehouse in San Bernardino, and Donald Sutherland is the repressed Homer (""No Relation"") Simpson, an accountant who's so alienated from his own feelings that he's reduced to howling in despair in his own garden. And, in fact, Sutherland's character is involved in one of the film's most harrowing moments, which features a young Jackie Earle Haley as a promising child star of indeterminate gender but infinite obnoxiousness.Anyway, if you have a chance to catch this film on the big screen, by all means do so, and be sure to add the DVD to your collection -- although, since we're coming up on the 30th anniversary, it's just possible that Paramount Home Video might decide to give it the deluxe treatment it deserves. Frankenheimer, et al, manage to take a brilliant novella by Nathaniel West and turn it into an amazing piece of cinema that will stick with you long after the lights go up. And, as an added bonus, you can just enjoy it as a great story, or delve deeply into the symbolism. This is the kind of film that works both ways, and one that you cannot miss if you consider yourself any kind of film fan at all, at all.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWEyYjM4N2EtZDdjYS00YWJhLTk0N2ItZTNlOTdlMWI2OWU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It had its limitations, and it sure as hell could have been pushed past the ""Pat almost reveals his/her gender but then doesn't"" joke that seems to have been the limit of its humor.So when there was a movie, I thought, ""Hey, they're finally going to push the character beyond the one-joke limit. I like Pat, sure, I'll like the movie!"" Well, I was stunned at how ineptly and poorly executed the whole thing was. The Pat character is immediately portrayed as boorish, intrusive, insensitive, and a host of other undesirable characteristics. Who decided this is what Pat was about? Who thought this would be funny? And how does this relate to the SNL character, anyway? I see no resemblance at all.Even Dave Foley, whom I love and who is well-known for his excellence at portraying long-suffering comic characters, cannot soften the unrelenting ugliness that Pat exudes. In addition, I really think they took the low road with the ""Chris"" character. Of all the androgynous names they could have chosen (Terry, Bobby, Sam, the list is long), ""Chris"" is so boring! And the style of androgyny that was chosen, ""70's-esque flower child"", complete with page-boy haircut, while certainly complimenting Pat's dowdiness, was just one more joke with a very short lifespan.By the time you finally realize the ugly boorishness that Pat is all about is not going to be a short-lived bit, but is instead the main (and only) joke, and that you will get no reprieve at all, ever, through the entire film, it will be too late. You will have suffered through the whole film, with very few laughs, and entirely missed out on a ""naive-but-loveable-doofus"" version of Pat, that you might have expected to get.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2VhMjI0NDQtZWRjMS00ZWY4LTk2MmItZTY4MzE4M2ZmOTQ3L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjE5MjUyOTM@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

If these stars weren't attached to the movie nobody would bat an eye at this thing. It's so awful. I audibly ""ugh""-ed when it finished. The message this movie tries to convey is that it's hard to find a job, so you have to stop smoking pot and be determined and never give up and do whatever it takes to get a job. Or don't get a job and be an entrepreneur. The movie throws that one in at the end. A stupid message in the first place because, hey, not everyone has the same circumstances. This type of movie can only resonate with a niche crowd, but worse than that the writing is just dreadful. Cringe-City is what this movie should've been called. I felt bad for Miles Teller having to deliver these clichÃÂ© lines like, ""Never stop believing."" Sorry Get a Job but I learned that lesson from Journey a long time ago. Bryan Cranston and Alison Brie try to have fun in their roles, and they really brighten up the mood, but it isn't nearly enough.

The writing, the directing, the editing, the f*cking music, it all SUCKS. It's painful. It's one of those movies where you know if the actors weren't already attached to the project, it would've never been made. But the money was there so they hired great actors and they forgot about the rest of the crew so they got people on the street to do direct and their pet cat to write and who needs an editor anyway? The cat can do it! It's like an amateur film at points. I'll be honest, I chuckled a couple of times. And by a couple of times I mean it. I chuckled twice. Maybe smiled a few more times, but for a majority of Get a Job I was either cringing or frustrated at the fact that it was even greenlit and released.

This is exactly such a movie, and it's hard to believe that the original film in this series was actually quite good. Let's see, George Kennedy, the cigar chomping ""tough guy"" mechanic of the original has somehow been promoted to airline captain, and, after the Concorde comes under missile attack (don't ask), he resorts to stunts like shooting a flare gun out the cockpit window despite (presumably) flying at Mach 2, all the while doing the sort of wild high-G evasive maneuvers that would have ripped the wings off any real airliner, never mind the effect of the passengers! But the absolute worst part of the film, at least to dedicated airplane buffs like myself, is that this atrocity ""starred"" one of the coolest, sexiest, and most technologically remarkable planes ever to fly. The Concorde (or, just plain ""Concorde"" as its pilots refer to it) deserved far better, this abomination is the equivalent of taking a high class beauty like Audrey Hepburn and putting her in a ""Porky's"" sequel. Thankfully, the release of the ever hilarious ""Airplane!"" the following year brought the whole ""Airport"" franchise to a well deserved halt, as anyone even contemplating a fifth installment would have been laughed to death by studios and movie fans alike. 1/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThlOTkzOWMtM2U3Yy00NWRkLThkZTgtYWExOTE4OThhOWZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

When one of the teens is captured, those who remain - a group that includes the cop who put a bullet in Goodnight's head four years ago - band together to survive against the brutal killer.","140","It's HOR-larious!","All right, let's be realistic about this. Nobody goes into a movie produced by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God to a wrestling match), directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the Between the Cheeks trilogy), starring a wrestler named Kane, and expects a little slice of art on a golden platter. If you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time.So what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this? Well, here's what I was looking forward to:1) Bad acting. 2) A fairly non-existent, clichÃÂ©d storyline. 3) Kane walking around with a scrunched, sour face that indicates his nostrils just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago. 4) Tons and tons of gore. Well, if you're hungry for some ""so bad it's funny"" entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts.Obviously, movies like this are best seen for free, but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it. The filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses on the screen. This makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate.I also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. Tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most. I think my grand total was 107; can you beat that? I personally want to know how after 35 years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity, running water, and a working elevator?I know, I know, the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is, but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it.I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms. Uh-huh.I think you pretty much know what to expect, but I feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings. First, if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away. The people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show. Shouts of ""Kill him, Kane!"" and ""I hope you die first!"" and ""Chokeslam!"" echoed through the theater, showcasing what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer. I usually don't appreciate such audience interaction, but for a cheesefest like this I thought the commentary added to the entertainment value. However, I can see how others could be annoyed by it.Second, and this shouldn't even warrant explanation, the film doesn't shy away from the gore. If watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesn't scream ""fun night at the movies!"" for ya then you know good and well to save your dough.I must say that I was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on Kane's part. I wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic, but I was hoping he'd have some cute little catchphrase like ""Say goodnight"" (his character's last name is ""Goodnight"") right before he killed a victim. Instead he uttered four words in the entire film - ""Nooooooo!"" and ""I see it."" But hey, he delivered them flawlessly!If I were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like ""Place your BETTS!"" or ""All BETTS are off!"" It'd rule and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror films like See No Evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now we'll just call 'em HOR-larious!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MTgxNDI1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTkzMjYzMQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

For one thing, I think that they are generally biased and you are only seeing what the film-makers want you to see.  Now, I watched Paradise Lost for several reasons.  One, I've always been intrigued by peoples' ignorance and I'm still amazed at how quick they are to point a finger at something they know nothing about. Several years ago, I remember this story being all over the news, and the way it was presented then, it was very easy to believe that these three outcasts were the killers.  I've been through West Memphis numerous times since the killings and I still get the chills everytime I pass by the Blue Beacon truckwash.I sat down to this three hour film with a pretty open mind.  While the film doesn't really answer any questions, it does bring a lot to mind and never takes sides on whether the boys did or didn't do it.  That's what I admire about the film-makers.  They managed to stay almost completely neutral, no matter what their feelings or opinions may have been on who the actual murderer(s) were.Watching this movie is scary.  I've polluted my mind over the years with just about every junk-horror movie that I could find and nothing has given me that icy feeling quite like this has.  I've seen it three times now and it never loses its impact.For those who don't know, here's the story:  In West Memphis, three young children are found mutilated in a patch of woods just off the interstate. For no real reason whatsoever, three nonconformist teens are brought to trial, one of which has an I.Q. that is somewhere in the 70s.  When he gives a very phony sounding confession, the trials begin with absolutely no other evidence to prove that the boys are guilty.  Throughout the film, we meet each of the deceased boys parents, the defendents, and the defendents' families.  Most angry of all are the parents of the Byers boy who was murdered.  Now, before I get started on the step-father Mark Byers, I really want to say that I can totally empathize with the guy and his rage is completely understandable.  However, what I really can't get past is the guy's bizarre behavior and the impression that he left me with. The guy takes up a lot of screen time.  I know that the guy is a jeweler by trade and acting may not be his thing, but this is a DOCUMENTARY and while watching him, on more than several occasions I got a little confused. Yeah, the guy has some mental problems, he's on numerous medications, he's suffering from a brain tumor and he's going through some major grieving. But why does he act like he's been watching TOO much WWF?  His lines are straight out of a BAD movie and if this is how the guy really is, I'm staying the hell out of this guy's way.  Throughout the film there are several subtle (or not so subtle) indications that he may be a suspect. The fact that he gave one of the film-makers a bloody knife as a Christmas present more than proves that the guy is a little off his rocker.  He even admitted to having beat the child the day that he was murdered.Remember, there is absolutely NO physical evidence to pin on the accused and the only thing that got them there was a false confession given by a legally retarded teenager who had been interrogated for hours.  Oh, and did I mention that his story KEPT changing?  Listening to Jesse Misskelly, the time that the boys were murdered takes place all over the clock.  Once, he states that the boys were murdered in the A.M. hours, then during broad daylight, then at night. I don't get it.  It didn't matter to the jury. Two of the boys still got life sentences and the other (Damien Eckols) got the death sentence. His crime is that he had a fondness for wearing black, had a bad haircut, and a slight interest in Wicca...Not a whole lot different from myself.  Anyway, there is also mention of another mysterious person who made an appearance in a Bojangles restaurant restroom, covered in blood. Oh yeah, that is another issue that is barely mentioned, and then dropped.After seeing this movie, I was still terribly confused and my questions were still unanswered, but I guess that is the sign of a good documentary.  I'm really glad that the film-makers stuck with the facts and never let their opions get in the way of making the film.  The sequel is also very good, but still leaves nothing answered.  Now, it's been several years since the first time I watched this but the boys are still in prison, still trying to get out.  I reccomend this film to anyone who has ever been criticized for their appearance.  It'll make you realize just how lucky you are, while questioning the justice system at the same time.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2EzNWNlZGYtMjQ1YS00YTI4LThkYTctNjRjYzI1NDdmNjEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

SIMONE does the same for movies and Hollywood. It will certainly make my list of the Ten Best Films of 2002.  Put quiet simply McNichol has once again hit one out of the park.SIMONE is a beautiful actress that is made up of pixels. A series ones and zeros put together in a computer and placed into the film. Even her name is an abbreviation for the computer program that has made her possible: Simulation One.When Hollywood diva Wynona Ryder walks off director Viktor Taransky's (Pacino) film unfinished for nothing but silly reasons, his career is finally in the dumpster. He is offered salvation when a computer whiz, played in a fabulous cameo turn by Elias Koteas, offers him the solution.Taransky with the aid of the computer creates SIMONE the perfect actress. She doesn't talk back, does what she's told and doesn't make trouble.  Made up from parts of the very best that Hollywood has to offer she is breathtakingly beautiful. She becomes bigger than life itself which McNicholl cleverly shows by placing Simone's picture on the sides of three story buildings and has Pacino or other mortals walk by in front the portraits. As an actress Simone is less than brilliant, but no one seems to notice. In fact, that is the point, nothing this woman does is wrong.  The public as McNicholl's character Christoff in the TRUMAN SHOW says `accepts whatever Universe that is presented to them as real.'  McNichol tell us in both SIMONE and TRUMAN SHOW that people believe what they want to believe; what they feel comfortable believing. SIMONE says that your eyes will lie to you.  That what you see is only true if that is what you want it to be.  It is a warning to a complacent society to be on guard. The media is capable of creating their reality, one that will make us happy, warm and fuzzy, in order to control what we see, think and feel. That they in fact all ready do this through advertisement and slanted, controlled news. It warns us not to blindly trust what we are shown by the media. SIMONE reminds us of elements in WAG THE DOG where a fictious war is created and since it is shown on TV we will believe it. SIMONE is both hilarious and thought provoking. Pacino's performance as the washed up film director takes on a rather Dr. Frankenstein feel when his creation becomes uncontrollable, not for what she does but for the way that the public reacts to her. After she becomes big he can't admit to the fraud because no believes him and he can't kill her off because the public refuses to let her die. Pacino is brilliant.  You cannot go wrong with this one, it's a winner.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjZmNjhjMGUtYmNmYi00MGYyLTk0YTItOWM4MmVmMDIwNmU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUwNzk3NDc@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It seems more like a video diary of the progression of one of the protagonists' illness, which also doesn't quite work, since there are inexplicable time jumps and events that remain unmentioned.The documentary only relies on its high emotionality to attract an audience and there is nothing more to tell.It's not completely flat and boring, but I would recommend other works alluding to the topic in question, such as the films Still Alice or The Father.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFiMjFlZjEtMDM5Zi00MmIzLTliM2EtZTc3NjUzNzA3ZWI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTYzMDUzNjEw._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I really never cared for Drew Barrymore, before.  However, my opinion of her has changed.  Drew put in an INCREDIBLE performance in this movie.  She really nailed it.  In fact, all of the actors gave commendable performances. I was so moved that I was quite uncomfortable for much of the movie.  The pain that was portrayed was so real that I almost regretted purchasing what I thought was supposed to be a comedy.  I'm glad I got through it - and an hour later I'm still stunned by what I saw.  This movie is well worth seeing. Perhaps the reviewers who hated it don't understand that you can be repulsed by another person's behavior, but you don't have to agree with them.  You don't have to accept their morals (or lack thereof) in order to recognize what they are going through.  And perhaps in seeing these roles acted out, you will see someone you know who has touched your life.  Perhaps you'll even see yourself.  I profess to have high moral standards, but I was not offended by this movie.  I just felt very sad.  I've known people like these characters.   I don't feel that they were trying to justify their decisions.They were just telling a story.  I also think that this movie was a kind of therapy for Beverly, who is standing up, triumphantly, shouting, ""I went through a lot of crap and I made it!""

I had expected a serious critique on the way in which the highly addictive opioid ""OxyContin"" had come to impact on the lives of millions of American citizens. Instead, we get a rather muddled chronology of the life of activist and journalist Nan Goldin, interspersed by the odd demonstration aimed at destroying the reputation of the Sackler family - all of the founders of which (and therefore the principal collectors of the art and the original altruists) had been long dead. We are expected to have far too high a degree of knowledge here for the scientific elements to make sense. It, at no stage, offers us any explanation as to what the drug is, how and why it was prescribed - what was it supposed to do? Nor do we have any contributions from the US Federal Drug Administration or from the medical profession as to just how this was being prescribed by qualified medical personnel the nation over, without any ongoing assessment of it's effects nor any signs of intervention from national - or state - medical authorities. It takes far too simplistic an approach to these crucial and equally negligent issues, is scant on detail and in the end comes across as little better than a one-woman-rant. The fact that Goldin herself led a fascinating and interesting life may well be the subject of a documentary in it's own right - she was an hugely creative lady; but as a documentary on an shocking issue that could have informed me, I found it seriously lacking and one-sided. There can be no doubt that this drug, amongst others, caused abject misery to millions - but this really does miss an opportunity to educate and inform and maybe even to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the policing authorities and the courts when it comes to dealing with large-scale abuses. Pity, had it laid out arguments and offered us something of a balance it could have been so very much more interesting.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQ5OWRhMjktN2ZhOS00OTMzLWE1ZWItMjMxMGY2MWFiMzBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAyMjQ3NzQ1._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I will agree that the last act takes a bit of a wide turn in reality but it doesn't stray so far that the film goes off track.The main story is your typical fish out of water story but what person can't identify with Chase's Andy Farmer in one way or another? Of course the film takes it to the extreme and it's all the funnier for it. And the characters are a biting reminder that not everyone is normal or sane for that matter. The waitress who serves lamb fries without explaining what that really is until it is desperately too late. The sheriff who has to take a cab because he flunked his driver's test. The mailman who throws the mail to the road because he is drunk by the time he reaches the Farmer's residence.And the small touches? How about the dog that runs away from home just after being brought home for the first time? Or the umpire whose strike zone is a bit wide. The odd fate of Claude Musselman? And let's not forget the phone operator who can tell the sound of two pennies being dropped in a jar but fails to realize it's not a pay phone Chase is calling from? I laughed hard and often which is something odd for me in any film with Chevy Chase. In all the years with all of his films I can honestly say I have only enjoyed five of them (Foul Play, Vacation, Fletch, Christmas Vacation and this one. That's right I am not a fan of Caddyshack)and this is his best.One more small moment sums up the film's humor for me. Chase is fishing with some men he has just met. One of them men gets a hook stuck in his neck. Instead of trying to pull it out Chase thinks it easier to knock the man out so THEN they can pull the hook out. After punching the man three times in the face one of the other men finally steps in and says ""You're not knocking him out, you're only beating the p*ss out of him.""","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2MyNmQ2ZTQtYzE1Ni00MWQwLWE3ZTctMDcxOWE4ZTQzMjE5L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Hilarity ensues.","143","A misinterpretation","This is an inventive and artful production of Oscar Wilde's play, but I can confidently say that were Oscar Wilde alive today, he would be appalled at the misuse to which his play has been put. Indeed I think I feel the ground rumbling as he rolls over in his grave, and yes he is actually spinning in anguish.Oliver Parker, who directed and wrote the screen adaptation, simply misinterpreted the play. He focused on the ""dashing young bachelors"" when the real focus of the play is Lady Bracknell, the absurd and beautifully ironic representation of the Victorian mind who was then and has been for over a hundred years Wilde's singular creation and one of the great characters of English literature. She is supposed to steal every scene she is in and we are to double take everyone of her speeches as we feel that she is simultaneous absurd and exactly right. Instead Judi Dench's Lady Bracknell (and I don't blame Dench who is a fine actress) is harsh and stern and literal to the point of being a controlling matriarch when what Wilde had in mind was somebody who was both pompous and almost idiotic yet capable of a penetrating and cynical wisdom (so like the author's). Compared to Dane Edith Evans's brilliant performance in the celebrated cinematic production from 1952, Dench's Lady Bracknell is positively one-dimensional.The point of Wilde's play was to simultaneously delight and satirize the Victorian audience who came to watch the play. This is the genius of the play: the play-goer might view all of the values of bourgeois society upheld while at the same time they are being made fun of. Not an easy trick, but that is why The Importance of Being Earnest is considered one of the greatest plays ever written. This attempt turn it into a light entertainment for today's youthful audiences fails because this play is not a romantic comedy. It is more precisely a satire of a romantic comedy. Its point and Wilde's intent was to make fun of Victorian notions of romance and marrying well and to expose the mercantile nature of that society. It is probably impossible to ""translate"" the play for the contemporary film viewer since a satire of today's audiences and today's society would require an entirely different set of rapiers.Parker's additions to the play only amounted to distractions that diluted the essence of the play's incomparable wit. Most of Wilde's witticisms were lost in the glare of Parker's busy work. Recalling Lady Bracknell as a dance hall girl in her youth who became pregnant before being wed was ridiculous and not only added nothing, but misinterpreted her character. Lady Bracknell is not a hypocrite with a compromised past. She is everything she pretends to be and that is the joke. Showing Algernon actually running through the streets to escape creditors or being threatened with debtor's prison was silly and again missed the point. Algy was ""hard up"" true and in need of ""ready money"" but his bills would be paid. Gwendolyn in goggles and cap driving a motor car also added nothing and seemed to place the play some years after the fact.The big mistake movie directors often make when making a movie from a stage play is to feel compelled to get the play off the stage and out into the streets and countryside. Almost always these attempts are simply distractions. Some of the greatest adaptations--Elia Kazan's A Streetcar Named Desire from 1951 comes immediately to mind--played it straight and didn't try anything fancy. Here Parker seems obsessed with ""dressing up"" the play. What he does is obscure it.On the positive side the costumes were beautiful and Anna Massy was an indelible Miss Prism. Reese Witherspoon at least looked the part of Cecily and she obviously worked hard. Rupert Evertt had some moments in the beginning that resembled Wilde's Algernon, but he was not able to sustain the impersonation.My recommendation is that you not bother with this production and instead get the 1952 film starring, in addition to Edith Evans, Michael Redgrave and Margaret Rutherford. It is essentially true to the play as Wilde wrote it, and is a pure delight.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMzNmM5MGItMjkyZC00YWQ5LWI5Y2ItYjlmZGQwN2I4OTIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM0NTU5Mg@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He seeks to sign over his plays and sonnets to Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armesto), but that's easier said than done. When William Shakespeare takes credit (Rafe Spall), that's the least of concerns as the words of Edward affect the political climate.Rhys Ifans is an unrecognizable powerhouse, and though the rest of the cast fairs well, he shines. As does director Roland Emmerich, who uses every trick at his disposal to make a highly sophisticated drama littered with elaborate costumes and set decoration to be admired. The theatre experience is very well represented in Anonymous, with the narrator barely making the curtain. Believe it or not but this does actually happen and there are actors who specialize in. The workings of the theatre coincide with the events described and eventually merge. In the time of Edward, the Globe is shown with spectacular accuracy and the familiar faces of the troupe appear across plays.The future of England is put at stake as the insight into Edward's inspiration is penned on a relationship with Queen Elizabeth (Vanessa Redgrave and in younger form Joely Richardson). These secrets showcase the power of words to win over love and country. Is it cheating to inject stolen verse into a screenplay? To some extent yes. We're talking about a movie that lifts words, then says they came from a thief. A bit of a paradox if anything. Similarly, it would be silly for J.J. Abrams to direct a movie that's filled with scenes from every Steven Spielberg film, yet that happened with Super 8.If Anonymous has a fault, it would be in jerking around the audience. The movie starts with an inventive use of a framing device, and quite appropriately in a theatre. We go back and Ben Johnson is jailed, only for us to go back 5 years to see him getting jailed. Then we go back another 40 and when we next see Johnson he's being set free. SoÃÂ in which time is he released? Thankfully Anonymous is long enough to allow an audience to gain bearings.Anonymous is Emmerich's masterpiece, a radical far from his usual environmental apocalypse works. There could be a stigma surrounding the subject, which will be viewed as blasphemy by many. I'd like to reassure you that most popular cinema is an act of fiction. Shakespeare isn't available to rebut, and most moviegoers are not concerned with historical accuracy so long as the story is compelling and filled with drama, which Anonymous delivers.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxOTA5MTMxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI4MzU0NQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It was a television program that held them transfixed with tales of bravura and technological wonders. Lots of young children dreamed beautiful creative dreams because of this show.Fast forward to Christmas 2004. Lots of kids are gonna get a DVD called ""Thunderbirds"". The producers of this movie should get used to the singular ""clang"" sound because I can imagine lots of kids are going to toss this into wastebaskets the day after (or maybe the same day). They are throwing away the most thickheaded attempt at re-creating television greatness that this reviewer has ever seen.I am not saying that the original ""The Thunderbirds"" was the best of shows. It was a puppet show for chrissake! It had huge limitations based on what we know today.But then? If you were a seven to fourteen year old kid? The Thunderbirds was it! Jeff Tracey led and his sons followed, spirited and eager. Scott was the eldest and Jeff's ""rock"". He had Thunderbird 1ÃÂ.reconnaissance and remote command and control platform . Virgil had the looks but was so committed to Dad and the project. He had Thunderbird 2ÃÂÃÂthe perennial heavy duty workhorse. Gordon, John and Alan had the tough job of being expert in all the rest of the equipmentÃÂ.all heroes. And then there was Brains. An unparalleled engineering genius and our little secret. As much a part of the team as any other single member. As much flawed and quirky as he was amazing and lovable. Brains was not perfect, but he was the best Mother Earth had to offer.But the true beauty of this old show, the reason all of us got up at 6.00am to watch, was those wonderful beasts, the Thunderbirds themselves. Gerry Anderson knew that his creations were the star of the show and he made sure they were kept front and center.So, with this movie, what the hell where the producers thinking?Whoever was in charge, and I am not saying it was the Jonathan Frakes, had simply no idea. Obviously they had no idea that they were playing with an institution as opposed to a ""cool plot idea"".The whole movie was two thingsÃÂÃÂ.a Spy Kids clone and a running advertisement for FordÃÂÃÂ..and that's it!OK, the technical stuff was there. I thought the updating of our beloved Thunderbirds was quite good to a point.And Tracey Island seemed up to it. Had all the right stuff, except we never saw it work right.After that? It was all downhill into the pits. And it went pretty low.The script wasn't written, it was excreted. The casting was abysmal. The costuming was third rate.As a Father, I would be embarrassed if my son said this was a cool film. It would mean I would have to explain to him why it isn't. He is gonna see the original series one day so I have to.Whoever the mastermind is that concocted this mess should go away. To the producers that still own the rights? Give it another shot. People want to see the Tracey's solving problems as they do. Make my kids proud.

I was amazed that the filmmakers were able to corral literally hundreds of Black people into degrading and de-humanizing reenactments of various aspects of slavery.  But I also understood that this was a very special film for that exact reason.  Unlike American films about slavery, it makes no effort to excuse or sugarcoat this heinous act. Like the opening of Bunuel's Un Chien Andalou, the filmmakers intent is to force you to open your eyes to the truthful horrors of this 400 year old practice.The premise of the film is brilliant--an Italian documentary film crew is transported ""back in time"" to interview and bear witness to American Slavery on all levels--from rich slave owners, to the ""veterinarian"" who must clean and delouse the slaves, to the poor whites who don't own slaves but invade their quarters for the purposes of rape this movie holds nothing back, etc.  It loses points for some gratuitous nudity and violence (Mandingo, anyone?), and it's contemporary ending (which tries to connect the Black Power movement and the Nat Turner 1831 slave revolt) is somewhat muddled and clearly designed to leave viewers terrified.  The concept that Black men still hate white people but crave their women but would prefer to kill them rather than make love to them is an idea better tackled in the film version of Baraka's DUTCHMAN.  If the film were made a few years later it might end by raising the question of whether or not Black are still enslaved--not by carnal lust, but in a prison of the mind.But the recent DVD release of this film (and its Director's Cut) brings to light two things the shoddy bootlegs didn't. (1) Unlike typical grindhouse exploitation, this is first and foremost a work of art--the opening shot, taken from a helicopter flying over a plantation over a field of slaves, then drawing low enough to blow away the bales of cotton and causing the slaves to flee in glee is GENIUS.  Every image and idea is incredibly thought out.  The score is up there with the best of Morricone and Rota .  The photography and widescreen compositions are top-notch.However, it is unsettling to discover (2), most of the film was shot in Haiti with the full cooperation of mercenary dictator ""Papa Doc"" Duvaluier and the Tontons Macoutes (who probably had no problem getting hundreds of Hatian natives willing to degrade and dehumanize themselves for the purpose of making a film).  ).  In the end, this is a painful film to watch on many levels, but deserves to be seen alongside Alex Haley's ROOTS.   8.5/10 Stars.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmViZjhlYTYtMWU1OS00NTZlLThkYmQtNGQ1MTYxZGY2ZDhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzg1ODEwNQ@@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

That being said, understand that my take here will be at a ""10,000-foot level,"" meaning that I have to tell you as little as possible about the film itself to keep its integrity intact.Kyle Mooney has written the script (along with Kevin Costello) and plays James Pope, who lives in the desert with Ted (Mark Hamill) and April (Jane Adams). He spends most of his time watching his favorite show, ""Brigsby Bear,"" a children's program that has captured his imagination for his entire life. When the show is cancelled out of nowhere, James decides to take it upon himself to finish Brigsby's story.This is such a different kind of film that it was refreshing to me. Mooney, who is known in the current ""SNL"" cast for playing kooky, off- beat kinds of characters, channels those talents here and gives James a fun innocence that a character like this requires as the film progresses. His character's journey to fulfill his dream of closure and completion is well told in a way that hit me where I lived one moment, had me laughing out loud the next, and rooting for him in the moment after that. There is a great supporting cast here as well, but to talk too much about them will give away too much of the heart of this film.It truly is important to go into ""Brigsby Bear"" as cold as you possibly can, avoiding any Internet spoilers in any way, shape, or form in order to truly enjoy its story as a whole. Once you see it and enjoy it, also do everyone else a favor and let them experience it in the same spoiler-free manner that hopefully you did as well.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyODgyMTYzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk5NzY2MjI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I have just returned from the cinema, and i'm still thinking about Manderlay. The story continues where Dogville ended. Grace and her father makes a short brake their travel, and discovers that a slave is getting punished near by in a plantation named Manderlay. Grace's father continues his travel and Grace stays in Manderlay to set the slaves free, as they should have been 70 years ago, when the slavery was made illegal. And of course this is not easy.Manderlay isn't as shocking and far out as Dogville was. Not that it was a bad thing of course. But this is just a very much stronger film, because you get personally involved in the characters in a way that i don't think you did in Dogville. The only thing missing is a little bit of action. Nothing really happens. People just walk around and talk. The biggest scenes in the film has no direct influence on the following physical action and development in the story. well of course they does, but the development lies in the head of the characters. These developments are more interesting to analyze after you have seen the movie that during the movie. But instead of a lot of physical action we are given as i remember three truly terrifying and terrific scenes that are as strong as scenes in Dancer in the Dark and Breaking the Waves, and they does in my opinion make up for the lack of action.Manderlay is also a lot stronger i it's message than Dogville was. Yes, the message is pointed against USA, but as in Dogville, it is so much more than just a criticism of that country... it's a criticism of the human kind. The reason for Lars von Trier to place the story in USA is that he likes to tease the big ones. He said that in an interview on TV not so long ago. He also said that the screenplay was written before the incidents in Iraq, so it's a coincidence that there are so many parallels between the events in Manderlay and in Iraq.Lars von Trier is in my opinion one of the biggest directors of our time. It takes a courage, that i see in no other directors than him, to make a film like this. Manderlay is one of the bravest movies i have seen.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJmNmQ4ZDMtZjQ2ZS00YmMzLTg1YTctYWY3YTgzZjIyNzJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcwOTQzOTYy._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Let's call this approach ""amplification"": instead of trying to reason with this crowd, you try to one-up them in the most ludicrous way which still maintains a hair of plausibility (at least to those already deep into a conspiratorial mindset). So, every detail that even the conspiracy theorist overlooked becomes important, every theory they come up with is explained by a yet deeper theory, which, if they inquire about it, has its origin in yet a deeper theory, all based on a vast collection of seemingly random facts and events.The point of amplification is to fight absurdity with even more and outrageous absurdity, in the hope that at some point the conspiracy theorists realize on their own how ridiculous it all is. It is irony on steroids. A real-life example, albeit created more for the sake of satire than refutation, is the ""birds aren't real"" movement.I feel that SOMETHING IN THE DIRT is the cinematic equivalent of amplification. Two struggling co-tenants happen to come across a supernatural phenomenon and decide to try to turn their luck by making a documentary out of it in order to win money and prizes.The conceit of the story is that every single thread they follow, no matter how random or stupid, turns out to have some eerie significance in terms of connecting to other random or stupid threads. Their world is, in short, a conspiracy theorist's paradise, a universe in which nothing is random, yet at the same time nothing can mean anything because the meaning is always deferred to the next connecting thread.As the movie uncompromisingly follows the two protagonists' voyage deep into the head-spinning rabbit hole, we understand less and less what is causing the original supernatural phenomenon. At the same time, though, we gain a better understanding of the flaws that predisposed the two characters to become conspiracy theorists coming from vastly different backgrounds. Their flaws rob them of success in their venture, but not of their humanity, and so the characters are a mirror to the current age of Qanon and other stupid conspiracy theories.Reading some of the reviews, I feel that many viewers have misunderstood the movie. At the end, the phenomenon and many other strange connections are left completely unexplained, and it seems many people did not like this.But the movie really could not have done otherwise without compromising its integrity because offering a resolution to the mysteries the characters encounter, any resolution at all, would have undermined its central aim. It would have turned the film from an anti-conspiracy theory movie to just another conspiracy theory movie. I am not a big fan of open endings in movies, but in this case I can understand that it was absolutely necessary to make the point.The technical aspects of the movie are fine, and the central premise is ingenious. The greatest challenge this movie faces, I think, is to convey to the audience what exactly it is about, a challenge rendered all the more daunting by the fact that there really isn't any other movie like it. Movies with a message have to thread a fine line between being too obvious and preachy and being too obscure and mystifying. I think if DIRT had erred a little less on the side of being obscure, it could have communicated its message more clearly, a message which is more important now than ever.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQ2OWUxNzgtNDViNy00NmU2LThkMWUtM2Y5ZTVlNmNmNWViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMTg2ODkz._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

John Wayne as Genghis Khan is one of the worst examples of miscasting in the history in Hollywood, but that's not what makes the movie so funny.  What makes the movie funny is Wayne attempting to say the ridiculous purple prose of the script, the whole thing is written in this sort of pseudo-Shakesperian English, and John Wayne was always one of those rare actors who had serious trouble with anything like a grammatical sentence.  Whenever things start to lag Wayne has to say something like ""I ree-gret that Ah am without sufficient spittle to sa-lute you as you dee-serve"" or the classic ""Yore beautiful in yore wrath"".Also memorable for bad supporting performances by Agnes Moorehead and William Conrad, the sight of Wayne in Asiatic eye-makeup and Fu-Manchu moustace (the only biography of Khan I've read says he was white anyway), Susan Hayward doing a clumsy sword dance, a rape scene that would embarrass the tackiest Bodice-ripper, kitschy sets, and a Las Vegas revue act featuring a female dancer in a white leotard with a patch of fringe right *there*.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmEzMDg5NTItNjFjMC00NGVlLTkxMWEtZjJjMGVmZWVkMjIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc5NjEzNA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The mission is to infiltrate a company that each other work in, and expose a secret product the company is releasing. Soon things get out of plan, and the two spies realize they have more feelings for each other than they recently thought. I've been a fan of Clive Owen ever since Children of Men, and I was so gratified to see Julia Roberts back on the screen. A few years ago both Clive and Julia did a movie together called ""Closer"", and it was satisfying to see them back together again. Their performances together are the only uplifting value of this film. Although we could have used more of Paul Giamatti and definitely more Tom Wilkinson, the entire cast was perfect for this film. This movie had too much potential in the first half, but after that it becomes a confusing and mind boggling mess of a movie. There were so many twists, and confused story telling even I heard some of the audience members yell out ""Huh? What was that about?"" The script was good, but the story was horribly told that it came to a very disappointing outcome. That's a shame because I was expecting to enjoy a good suspense movie that wasn't confusing. Duplicity is a often funny and well acted movie, but you'll have to find either the film's director or the screenwriter to translate the story for you, or else you won't get it. It surprisingly turns romantic in the end which makes it a fairly good date movie, but you'll be more confused than dazzled.

The film is an effective mix of traditional filmmaking,'found footage', and even actual documentary footage and news reels. This melding of fiction with 'faux-real' footage and factual footage was perfect given the subject matter (which revolves around the real-life MKUltra 'mind control experiments' conducted by the CIA during the Cold War). The film also cleverly mixes in the genuinely creepy lore of shortwave 'numbers stations', resulting in a calling card for the film's villain which is flat-out *beep* scary. Speaking of the 'villain', I don't want to give away too much, but I wanted to congratulate the director for creating a 'Big Bad' that is unnervingly ambiguous and 'unknowable', both in terms of motivation and appearance. The performances are solid, and I particularly enjoyed the Hunter S. Thompson-esque character for the humour he brought to the proceedings.

The first moment we see a carefree, laughing Oppenheimer, it is obvious that the film is going to take quite a few liberties with characterization. When Paul Newman strides onto the scene, accompanied by ""Patton""-like music, all credibility is immediately destroyed. My major problem with Fat Man & Little Boy is the character of Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer was a complex character, a misfit, a neurasthenic polymath. This film only scratches the surface of his personality, and the actor who plays him is horribly miscast, although he tries his best. Towards the final days of the Project, Oppenheimer had become extremely thin and cadaverous. The constant hounding by Communist hunters digging into his personal life coupled with his moral qualms about the use of the Bomb threw him into a state of nervous exhaustion bordering on paranoia. There is no hint of the inner man in this portrayal. The community of physicists at Los Alamos was a collection of brilliant and unusual men. There were many conflicts and a lot of competition going on which are pretty much ignored. It was frustrating to see all of this potentially rich material cast aside in order to simplify the film and make it accessible. In addition to ignoring the real characters involved in the Manhattan Project and misinterpreting the ones it treats, the film introduces John Cusak as the ""Everyman Physicist,"" a fictional character created to humanize(?)the subject and engage the ""average viewer,"" along with the obligatory love interest. This slows the movie down to a crawl and it was walking pretty slowly to begin with. This movie takes a situation rich in drama and conflict coupled with scientific and historical interest and turns it into a boring, simplistic soap opera.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmUzNjY5NTAtODExZi00MDM5LWE0OGQtOWI0NGI3OTYzNmI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQzNDI3NzY@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Mira Nair introduced the film, along with Nitin Sawhney, who wrote the score.I admit that I loved the book, and therefore have been looking forward to this film for a while. As a second generation Bengali Brit who was born in India and went to university in the US, I know something about what it means to feel displaced, to be a stranger in a strange land, though I have never felt like an immigrant. I also have the Bengali dilemma of having two names. So the book has a lot of resonance for me.Fortunately the film does full justice to Jhumpa Lahiri's novel. Cramming a story spanning three decades into two hours without making it feel rushed or contrived takes some doing, and Mira Nair paces it beautifully. The cinematography, the editing (juxtaposing Calcutta and New York), and even the colours of the opening credits are all spot on.The cast are by and large, superb. Kal Penn does really well as the central character, Gogol. Anyone who has seen him in Harold & Kumar and Van Wilder: Party Liaison may have had reservations about a comic actor (albeit talented) playing this part, but he portrays the character as a confused, vulnerable, and multi-layered young man who ultimately learns to become comfortable in his own skin.But perhaps the main reason why this story appeals to me to so much is the similarity between the experiences of his parents Ashok and Ashima and what I imagine it must have been like for my own parents when they came to England. Both Irfan Khan and Tabu are excellent. They bring a mix of loneliness, hope and pathos to their roles, people who cannot let go of their past but are prepared to sacrifice everything for their future. Their innate ordinariness is what makes their characters so sympathetic and believable.Much like Monsoon Wedding, this is a visual and lyrical film. It is an essay on home, and on going home, not the physical place, but the state of mind.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAzNDA1NjEyMDJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDkxODQxNw@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I found them believable, real, with some depth, in conflict. Not cardboard, cartoon-like. I found that I could really identify with and care about them.The story. I thought it was really interesting and realistic. The behind-the-scenes look at political machinations was exciting. I tend to like movies without special effects, that are not unrealistic fantasies. (""Ordinary People"" generally comes to my mind.) I thought that this movie simply took real-life type people, put them in interesting situations, filled with conflict, and had us watch them deal with the problems they were in.I also think the movie had a message for us, in terms of right and wrong. In fact, it's downright Shakespearian. (Contrast this with another Al Pacino movie, ""Heat"", where the criminals are portrayed just as sympathetically as the law enforcement officers, and there is no inkling at all that there is anything morally wrong with armed robbery. I'm uncomfortable with that.)It's refreshing to see a movie in this day and age without gratuitous sex, violence, bombs and bullets, profanity.On a cinematic level, I found the directing, acting (the entire cast) and production to be first rate.I realize that many, many people (possibly the large majority) don't see things as I've described here.

Why this trashy unpleasant film was released on Easter weekend is beyond me.There is no coherent story. Upon getting over an ex-girlfriend who got possessed by evil spirits, Malcolm hooks up and moves in with a new girl Megan and her two kids. What follows is an embarrassing mishmash of scenes from recent big hits in the horror genre, ""Sinister"", ""Insidious"" and ""The Conjuring,"" as Malcolm continues to be terrorized by demonic events. Marlon Wayans plays Malcolm in the most irritating and annoying manner, with his non-stop loud screaming and nonsensical ranting. He has a prolonged, uncomfortable and unfunny sex sequence where Marlon gets it on with a doll that looks like the diabolical Annabelle from ""The Conjuring"". More awful jokes of such sick sexual nature would recur through the rest of the film.You go into a spoof film like this to have a shallow laugh out of jokes inspired by your favorite horror films. However, within the first few minutes, you already get the feeling that this film will not entertain you at all. In fact, it could even be quite boring, with very long humorless scenes that overstay their welcome. There are many scenes which would offend pet lovers, Catholics, Mexicans, women, and practically everyone else. I found it interesting only when it tries to recreate a recognizable scene from those modern horror classics, like the group hanging from ""Sinister"" or the ""Hide and Clap"" game from ""The Conjuring"". But unfortunately, I wind up disappointed because its spoofing just falls terribly flat. I would have had a good time if a film was dumb and funny, but this film is just plain dumb, not funny. 1/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4Njc2MTY4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQyNTg1MTE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Where it fails is that it is a terrible remake of a well-known, well-loved film. And even worse for this film, it's a lousy remake of a well-known, well-loved film that just happens to be my favorite Christmas film of all time.It has a few positives. All right, it has one positive, and that is Richard Attenborough. He brings a genuine delight to the role of Saint Nick, and it is not hard to believe this guy could be the genuine article. Unfortunately, his performance highlights the lousy performances of many of the principles.Dorey Walker is played by Elizabeth Perkins with none of the sympathy given to her by Maureen O'Hara. It's impossible to even dream of her getting married to anyone. Some of this is to be blamed on the script, though, which spends so much time establishing Dorey's cold heart that it forgets she's supposed to be getting our sympathy, not our scorn. Which brings us to the flat performance of Dylan McDermott. He could be replaced with a cardboard cut-out without affecting the flow of the movie. Then we have Mara Wilson. She tends to be more snobby and over-confident than confused, but Wilson is up against Natalie Wood. To be fair, we never get to see Wilson chattering like a monkey for comparison purposes. That delightful scene was excised from the modern version.A rather ridiculous subplot has been added to this remake with a rival store, Shopper's Express, trying to put Cole's out of business (Macy's refused to have their name put in the film). It is headed by the popular 90's villain of choice, the Greedy Evil Mean CEO, Victor Landbergh. He doesn't play much of a role, yet he is supposed to be the encompassing bad guy, evoking images of Lex Luthor plotting the demise of Superman. He even has his own flunkies who attempt to sabotage the department store, skittering around almost like Boris and Natasha. This subplot tends to weigh down on the film, feeling forced in rather than meshing with the film. The pompous psychiatrist of the original works because it was simply one guy with a chip on his shoulder instead of a wicked retail overlord. The former is funny, while the latter is overkill.Actually, that addresses another problem with this film - it takes its subject matter far too seriously. The original film was an enjoyable farce. This one is a somber story, filled with the right glurgy turns to renew our souls or something. Basically, it's way too serious considering the subject matter (an old guy who thinks he's really Santa Claus.) The original had some laugh out loud moments of sharp humor - this one instead attempts to force you to shed tears of sadness and joy. It usually just shed tears of boredom from me.The court decision at the end of the film is not only anti-climactic, but doesn't really address the actual issue - Kris is on trial for lunacy. The only decision to save him is to prove he's REALLY Santa Claus, thus making him sane. This movie can't seem to make up its mind why he's on trial and its ultimate answer for Kris obvious acquittal would fall upon under the lightest of legal scrutiny, where the original film made a compelling legal argument. I can't answer that, but I will say that this film's answer is far off the mark. Please, I beg of you-if you have NOT seen the 1947 Black and White original, then please correct that. This is not an adequate substitute to a film that didn't need one in the first place. They even colorized the old one, so if you hate black and white, then you still have a color option without wasting your time on this.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjk3M2UyN2YtNmQ1MS00MWI3LWEzNGMtYTRkM2E5MWNjOWJjL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Gadar was the biggest mass hysteria since Sholay (1975), with footfalls crossing the Insane 5 crore mark in the 21st century, which no other Bollywood film could do in the last 22 years. Why? Because Gadar had a love story conflicting between India and Pakistan elements right after Partition. The saga went even more crazy when an Indian crushed the Pakistani army single-handedly in Pakistan. Masses were entitled to go bonkers, and that's one of the main reasons why no other Bollywood movie has managed to repeat the same hysteria again since then. Gadar 2 follows the same pattern by arranging the characters differently, and it's a well-written script for Gadar's sequel-at least for its continuity, but for 2003, not 2023. Filmmaking and audiences have come far ahead in these two decades, but Anil Sharma seemed more interested in 2003's audiences and 2003's filmmaking. It doesn't hurt when a normal hit movie gets a bad sequel, such as Satyamev Jayate 2 or Heropanti 2, as they were never iconic movies. But it hurts when a popular mass film like Ghayal gets a sequel like Ghayal Once Again, and a historic blockbuster like Gadar gets a sequel like Gadar 2.Gadar 2 begins with a backdrop of the 1947 partition and a 2-minute brief of Gadar: Ek Prem Katha, as narrator Nana Patekar introduces us to the Gadar world and the new villain, Hamid Iqbal (Manish Wadhawa). Hamid was in the British India Army before independence, and his family was killed by Hindus in Hindu-Muslim riots before Pakistan got separated from India. He hates Indians, Hindus, and Tara Singh, who killed 40 of his officers while bringing Sakina back in Gadar 1. Switch to 1971, as the Indian Army smells another war with Pakistan (especially the Bangladesh partition), while Tara Singh (Sunny Deol) is still a truck driver, living happily with his wife, Sakina (Ameesha Patel), and son, Jeetey (Utkarsh Sharma). Jeetey wants to be a Bollywood actor, and Tara wants his son to be an army officer. Tara helps the Indian army and is captured during a raid. Young Jeetey decides to go to Pakistan to bring his father back, but he himself gets arrested for being a spy. Tara, who has returned home after a while, can't be silent, and so he heads towards Lahore to get his son back. How Tara Singh and Jeetey fight the entire Pakistani army in Pakistan is what you get to see in the second half.Gadar 2 seems like a well-intentioned script for a sequel because it attempts the same pattern they sold us two decades ago. It's the screenplay and execution that torture you with two-decade-old fashion in every scene. From Shivaa.. Shivaa.. in Brahmastra to Jeetey.. Jeetey.. in Gadar 2-that's how we have evolved over the last year. It wasn't long ago that people criticised Satyameva Jayate 2 and Heropanti 2, and here we have Gadar 2 trying to be in the same zone. It's just that SMJ and Heropanti were smaller brands, and here Gadar is trying to sell us a huge brand. It will be enough to get contemporary commercial success and good funds, but not the legacy. The landmark for Gadar's sequel can't be 100 crore, 200 crore, or 300 crore. It was a film that sold 5 crore+ tickets; will Gadar 2 get the same numbers or even half of that? You are cashing in on Legacy, but what about creating your own legacy? Of course, Gadar 2 will get a bigger opening because it is a brand now, but it will not see the same success because they haven't been able to create that kind of product again.Gadar 2 is so outdated and frustrating occasionally that people were laughing at action scenes. However, some crazy mass belt audiences are enjoying the same scenes. That's two sides of cinema for you, and an iconic movie always finds a perfect blend of both. Gadar 2 is quite a one-sided affair, though. That handpump will have two extreme reactions: one side will enjoy it, while the other side will roll down the floor laughing. There are many instances like this in the film, and it's a very long film, let me tell you. Morpheus offered a red and blue pill in The Matrix, and here the villain offers the Red Book (Bhagawad Gita) and Green Book (Quran) to his victims. In 2 hours and 50 minutes, Sunny Deol becomes Mr. India for almost an hour before the intermission, and when he returns, you expect some fireworks. He gives you that, but the ammunition is not modern. I don't even know why someone would use swords in the post-50s era. The 1971 conflict could have been a game changer for the film, but they didn't know how to use it. It was used as a backdrop, not the main conflict, like Gadar used 1947 to set the base for the entire film.One of the best things about Gadar 2 is that Sunny Deol is back in Tara Singh's crazy, massy Avatar. He roars like a lion, actually noisier than a lion, with the help of a camera, mic, and sound sync to scare the hell out of the Pak army. That Katori wala dialogue and Hindustan Zindabad bring back the old memories, but only for a moment. Ameesha Patel looked breathtaking in Gadar Part 1, and it would be too much to ask her to look the same after 22 years. Her part also doesn't offer anything and is far less than Gadar 1. On the contrary, Utkarsh Sharma has more screen time, and he is good in only some scenes. That Rajesh Khanna's filmy style was well acted, but not well crafted. Simrat Kaur fills the missing gap of a beautiful face, as she looks gorgeous throughout the film. Her role is fine too, but she needed more confident body language. Manish Wadhva is packaged as an evil from the ancient era. So much hype and so much introduction to prove what a devious personality he is. He looks dangerous and acts so too, but can anyone ever replace Amrish Puri Ji as a villain? Even Manish would say a big NO. Nonetheless, he is strictly okay. The supporting cast of Gaurav Chopra, Luv Sinha, Mushtaq Khan, Rakesh Bedi, Dolly Bindra, and a few other known faces pass by without any hesitation.Gadar 2 has not been made on a huge budget of over 300 crore or 400 crore, so it's fine if it doesn't have any larger-than-life action sequences. Who needs them when you have larger-than-life characters like Tara Singh? On the technical front, Gadar 2 has managed a recent show on a moderate budget. The Cinematography is okay, the editing lacks engagement, the background score is old-fashioned, and the production design is pretty decent. The music scores passing marks with old hit numbers coming back with honest recreation, and the lyrics sound fine too. Anil Sharma has directed 6 films after Gadar, and he hasn't had a single HIT till date. It seems that his wait for a box office hit will be over with Gadar 2. The credit goes to Gadar 1, of course. Anil Sharma had an opportunity to create history, but he was stuck in history himself. The idea of making a film with outdated storytelling is so annoying and disturbing. That's why he couldn't score a hit. Had Gadar 2 been a non-Gadar film, he would have had another flop because the film is so bad. But thanks to Gadar's legacy, even a bad product will sail past the tough times of post-pandemic. Happy days ahead for the box office, at least for a week, but why did we have to sacrifice brand Gadar for that? This needs to be discussed someday in the future. For now, Tara Singh is back with a blockbuster that should have been made in 2003 but arrived in 2023.RATING - 4/10*","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzcwNTEwYzgtZmUxYy00MTRlLThlNTUtMjQ0MTdlZWQyZTNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ3Mzk2MDg4._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I've seen it for the first time when I was in my early teens (12 or 13, not sure), and I was really impressed by the animation and the plot. Besides, I didn't have a chance to see a lot of sci-fi movies (let alone animated movies) back then.Now, that I've been able to see it again, I find it really outdated (or ""old-skul"") - pretty much, it felt like Kubrick's ""Space Odissey"" animated, only that ""Gandahar"" came out in late 80es, when ""Akira"" set a new industry standard. The plot is more or less predictable, the sci-fi backgrounds looked like something from mid-70es, and the battle scenes are even worse than those of cheap Japanimation TV series.Despite all the bad things above, this movie got a touch of a master. First, I have to admit that movement animation feels highly original (I can't think of anything similar) and is done with a lot of skill. Second, the voices (in French) are much better than anything I've heard. Finally, I find character design very good.To sum up, I don't think that this is quite the right movie to see ""just for fun"", but for those who are interested in animation it is definitely a must.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMzNTU2ODktNGQ1NC00MDJjLTk5MWUtZmFlYWRiNDUxNGUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_UY209_CR6,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"
"Perfect Stranger","2019.0","16","109.0","Crime, Mystery, Thriller","5.7","31.0","James Foley","Halle Berry, Bruce Willis, Giovanni Ribisi, Richard Portnow","51,195","A journalist goes undercover to ferret out businessman Harrison Hill as her childhood friend's killer. Posing as one of his temps, she enters into a game of online cat-and-mouse.","151","What's the point of guessing if the movie doesn't play fair?","After viewing Perfect Stranger, I went on the film's page at the IMDb, and found out that there were three different endings filmed, each one with a different character being guilty. This does not surprise me at all. This is a movie that jerks us around simply for the sole fact that it wants to jerk us around. It doesn't want us to figure it out, and it doesn't play fair. When I realized that there was no point in following the clues and the movie simply plays to the demands of the filmmaker and which ending worked best with test audiences, it made me hate this shallow and silly excuse for a thriller even more.The film centers on an investigative journalist named Rowena (Halle Berry) who specializes in going undercover and exposing corporate and political frauds with the help of her creepy best friend and co-worker Miles (Giovanni Ribisi) who seems to have a certain unhealthy obsession with her that is painfully obvious to the audience, yet Rowena seems blissfully ignorant to. Rowena's having a tough time after she quits her job due to one of her stories falling through and a childhood friend of hers named Grace (Nicki Aycox) turns up dead. The two women just happened to have a chance meeting in a subway shortly before Grace's murder, and she told Rowena about how she had been having an on-line affair with a powerful New York ad executive named Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis). Grace had mentioned that their relationship had recently soured, and that Harrison was no longer talking to her. When evidence pops up that Grace may have been pregnant, Harrison becomes all the more suspicious to Rowena, especially since the man is married and has a long history of past affairs. Deciding to investigate on her own, Rowena turns up at Harrison's corporate office as a Temp and tries to get close to him, with Miles trying to dig up more dirt on the guy. Naturally, things are not what they seem, and the movie has more red herrings than a fresh fish market to keep us guessing in sheer futility.There's nothing exactly wrong with the concept behind Perfect Stranger, and director James Foley certainly gives the movie an attractive look. The problem lies with the screenplay by Todd Komarnicki. He seems to be trying to make an erotic murder thriller along the lines of Basic Instinct, but the movie is not very erotic nor is it very thrilling. The pace is leisurely to the point of being nearly stagnant, and the few sex scenes contained within the film are completely and instantly forgettable. I guess we're supposed to be enthralled by the twisting plot that casts everyone who plays a major role into a shadowy light. The movie stresses time and time again that everyone has dirty secrets, and yes, many secrets are exposed. The problem is almost all of these secrets exist simply to throw us off course. Not one leads to the correct answer. The answer exists simply in whatever of the three endings worked out the best. A thriller like this has to be planned out and lead to one true answer, not whatever answer the filmmakers feel like. Long before we find out that the movie doesn't even want to play fair, Perfect Stranger never truly captures our attention to start with. The characters are murky at best and, as previously mentioned, exist simply to lead us in multiple directions. They are victims of a plot that knows it's clever. They have no personality and no real motivation other than to act as red herrings. A good example is the character of Harrison Hill, who is slimy simply because he is supposed to be slimy for the sake of the story. He cheats on his wife, he threatens his business enemies, and when he finds out that one of his employees has been leaking info to an outside source, he physically abuses him right in front of all the other employees. None of these actions truly matter. They have no motivation and they do not drive his character to any sort of goal. We can't become attached to these people, because they're not even human to start with.Since winning the Oscar for Monster's Ball, Halle Berry seems to be on a strange single-minded quest to kill her career. Chalk up another loss for Berry. She's passable at best, but just about any other actress could have filled her shoes, and she brings nothing to the character. Same goes for Bruce Willis, who has absolutely no charisma, and we cannot understand why he is such a ladies man except for the fact that the movie tells us he is. The only performance that does stand out is Giovanni Ribisi as Miles, and it's for all the wrong reasons. He is immediately suspicious to us, because Ribisi plays up the weirdness of his character almost from the instant he walks onto the screen. This makes the fact that Berry's character does not even seem the least bit unnerved by him make her come across as a total idiot. I will not reveal the ending of Perfect Stranger, but I will say this. When the ending comes, did you personally see anything during the course of the movie that could have led us to the conclusion it wants to lead us to? We don't get the full story beforehand. All the clues, all the evidence, all the paths it had led us down had nothing to do with anything. The movie is a great big exploding cigar that laughs at us when everything blows up in our face. There are no right and wrong answers. Just one very uninteresting movie that doesn't even have the nerve to play fair.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4ODUwMTk3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI1MTEzMw@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

During the semester, DeVito, mellows, students learn enough to advance,and Army brass begins to appreciates the new teacher.The best part of this film is not DeVito's or the student's redemption but the film's beguiling Shakespeare presentation.

There are about a dozen characters and each one have different motives and I think most people can handle no more than 4 motives. The other reason is that the ""main characters"" are not the heroes of the story. They set the story in motion and keep it together but they are not who the movie is about and to tell a story in such an unconventionally roundabout way is entirely confusing for some people.So you may not like this movie if...You are uncomfortable with violence being violent,You can't keep track of the motivations of 8 separate characters,You automatically believe that the story is about the characters played by the actors pictured largest on the box.otherwise you may really like this movie because it's really well made in all its aspects.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAyNjEyMDEwMzBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDczMjY1NDEy._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

One of the most controversial giallos to come out of Italy. Released ten years after Don't Torture a Duckling(1972) which was also controversial for different reasons.  Lucio Fulci has filmed vicious scenes of violence before but New York Ripper takes the cake in violent imagery. As brutal as giallos like Giallo a Venezia(1979) and The Killer is Still Among Us(1986).  What makes the violent scenes for some tough to digest are the intense physical emotions of the murderer when killing his victims.Gives new meaning to the term hardcore horror.  Some of the most brutal depiction of hardcore horror I have witnessed in a horror film.  Many of the film's contents have many similarities with Maniac(1980) which gained controversy for identical reasons.  Daring approach by Fulci in making the hardcore horror moments both powerful and ugly.  The director had guts in doing a giallo with an extremely unpleasant subject matter.  Misunderstood Lucio Fulci film that is one of his finest horror films.An aspect that either humored, shocked, or upset many people was the mock duck voice used by the murderer.  I find that the duck voice of the killer adds to his menacing and sick presence.  The duck voice of the murderer was a reference by the director to his earlier 1970s giallo, Don't Torture a Duckling(1972).  A reference that is lost among some horror film enthusiasts.  Capped what would be Lucio Fulci's second and final prosperous artistic period of his film career.  The director's sole horror film with erotic overtones that adds to the controversial style of this  pic.Grim and relentless portrayal of human nature and its darkest aspects.  The bleak nature of New York Ripper(1982) makes Lucio Fulci's gothic films look happy go lucky.  Explodes with lots of anger and resentment that gives it a depressing feel.  Dipped deep in nihilistic waters with the depressing portrayal of human behavior.  The subplot involving the disabled little girl is uncomfortably sad.  One film that has its plot full of anger and resentment is Abel Ferrara's Ms. 45(1981).New York Ripper(1982) is filled with some of the director's usual quirks and visual trademarks.  Fulci's direction pushes the limit in scenes of sadistic violence.  Sometimes part of the story seems to come from the gut of the controversial filmmaker.  Direction does have some negative aspects but the negatives are few and far between.  The direction of Lucio Fulci for New York Ripper(1982) is not as flashy or flamboyant as Dario Argento's direction of Tenebre(1982)(except in a few moments).  He does get the job done with competence and craftsman experience.Comparisons can be made between Lucio Fulci's New York Ripper(1982) and Dario Argento's Tenebre(1982).  Both films deal with similar motifs and themes on violence towards women.  Also, each film are gory uncompromising giallos with striking images.  New York Ripper and Tenebre each have a show stopping moment of gory murder.  These two films use bold filmmaking techniques.  Each changed some of the rules of the giallo genre.There are many scenes that were controversial but the one that placed New York Ripper in film infamy was the infamous death scene of Daniela Doria. Two years for Daniela Doria after being part of another controversial scene in The Gates of Hell(1980).  For a gruesome moment of vile violence it certainly has a excellent build up and pay off.  As in Zombie Flesh Eaters(1979) the eye motif becomes a major part of this scene.  Daniela Doria has to get kudos for acting in a difficult scene as this one.  The merger of the erotic and the violent is what makes this particular scene hard to watch.There is a small film noir quality within the frame of the story.  This is because of the assortment of unsympathetic characters that surround it.  The only person that comes close to having any moments of sympathy is Jane.  Lt. Williams is an unlikable protagonist who comes out as arrogant and self centered.  The character of Lt. Williams seems to be inspired by the close minded Police Detective of Let Sleeping Corpse Lie(1974).  Dr. Davis comes out in the film as a narcissist who's too please with his intellect.What turned off even some of the Lucio Fulci admirers was the realistic look of New York Ripper's violent scenes.  Unlike in his gothic films from the same period there is no fantasy subtext to make the violence bearable.  Its realistic elements help make New York Ripper(1982) into a courageous effort of fercious horror.  The violence depicted towards women is what it is and that's disgusting but at the same time has a certain realism that doesn't make it totally misogynistic.  New York Ripper moves away from the comic book feel of Fulci's gothic pictures and into the realism of his early 1970s giallo pictures.  Its realistic depiction of violence is the film's biggest strength.Abel Ferrara made a little ribbing to the title of this film when the killer of Fear City(1985) is once referred to as New York Knifer.  Two of the film's writers had worked with Fulci before on Don't Torture a Duckling. Unusually tightly plotted thriller which never clicks in a good flow in some moments.  Excellent camera work created by Deep Red(1975) DoP, Luigi Kuveiller.  Its not a perfect motion picture but for a bold horror film it certainly delivers the goods.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBjZGE3NmEtMzk1ZS00NWM0LWEyOTYtMWM5MTYyM2EyZTU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

A sympathetic cast I know from the Guy Richie's Snatch with lovely variety of British accents, this film features a lively plot, very funny quotes and a good physical humor, elaborate shots, and an interesting range of prison characters. No matter the characters are rather flat, this simplification I was willing to accept, since the story was so good.Even though I may have seen better prison movies, and even some that are similar in plot; the Mean Machine is unmatched in the rather distant, ironical view of the prison world, honoring fair-play and manly virtues. Moreover, I was very happy not to see any homosexual relationships among the prisoners, no matter the actual prison reality.

Most people weren't prepared for John Hughes to break into more grown-up fare after his successful films about teens (Ferris Bueller, Pretty in Pink, etc.), and this film's failure (along with the failure of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles) forced Hughes into making commercially successful but artistically bankrupt crap like Home Alone.Although I was in college when the film came out, I instantly fell in love with the story of this fictionalized version of Hughes own early married life. Kevin Bacon did some of his best work in this film, and Elizabeth McGovern is simply radiant as the ""she"" of the title. Alec Balwdin is thin and disgusting as the ""best friend"" who has an unrequited lust for his pal's wife.Filled with surreal moments (which are par for the course today, in shows like Scrubs) where Bacon's character imagines his response (or the response of others) to various situations, several stand out. The wonderful suburban lawnmower scene, the moment when he imagines his in-laws giving sex advice (""Get your butt a little higher, Jake!""), etc.As a young father, I have felt everything Jake felt as they ventured into parenthood. Fear, wonder, and a weird sense of losing your wife's body to something you don't quite understand. And as funny as the film is, it is also quite poignant at moments and full of heart.The use of classic late 80's bands (a Hughes specialty) is excellent and quite extensive. Gene Loves Jezebel, Love and Rockets, XTX, Bryan Ferry, Everything But the Girl, and Kate Bush (whose song is used most effectively to tug at heart strings) are all used to highlight, comment on, and bring the story to life.Highly recommended and easily Hughes' most heartfelt film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjc3ZDZkNGQtNThkYS00NzViLTkyOWEtNWE3YTZmZmRlYzQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

However, the filmmakers were smart to make all the contestants totally different with different styles, making each one fun to watch. You didn't see the same thing each fight. There was everything from a huge Sumo-type wrestler to a little guy who imitated a monkey and a snake jumping and slithering around the ring. By the way, these were real guys, not actors imitating fighters.The photography is magnificent, far better than you would except. The colors are beautiful and the Thailand scenery spectacular.

Her middle name fits perfectly and is probably every man's dream woman. There are some stupid lines and bad acting (but not from the main characters) and overall it is a good flick, especially for the guys and for women who do not feel threatened by seeing so many gorgeous bodies.The addition of Pat Morita (from 'Karate Kid' fame) and Vincent Schiavelli (the subway ghost in 'Ghost' and so many other films) puts this film up a few more notches.

When Peter is kidnapped the company bring in expert negotiator Terry Thorne.  However when the oil company runs out of money due to no insurance, they take Terry off the case and he leaves for another job.  However a pang of conscience brings him back to help Alice and he replaces the corrupt locals.  As he tries to help get her husband back he also falls for Alice.As a fan of David Caruso, I was annoyed that I missed this film at the cinema (I blinked and I missed it!) and by the time the video came out it had slipped my mind.  Shown of tv last night was the perfect time for me to see it and, despite negative reviews, I actually quite enjoyed it.  I think the problem is that the critics struggled to get past the handful of problems (more later) to find that the film was an effective, if talky, drama with a thriller edge.  The premise is good and it allows tense scenes where Terry tough talks as well as scenes with Peter with his captors. It's not perfect in this regard as it is a bit talky but for me it was engaging - I got the impression from other comments that people had expected raging gun battles all the way through the film.However what does damage the film is Alice Bowman.  I can see the potential behind Terry and Alice's romance - it could have been another layer of drama.  In reality it doesn't work a bit and only serves to take away from the main thrust of the film - their relationship never convinces and nothing of interest is actually done with it.  Likewise the character of Alice doesn't really work either - I never believed she was emotionally going through the wringers to the degree the script suggested she would be.  A big part of the blame for this must lie with Meg Ryan herself.  She is miscast in the first place, but on top of that she is too pristine throughout the film - hair and makeup perfect no matter what and a stupid little hippie-girl personality that stops her being a real person.  It is a bad performance and the film would have benefited from a shorter running time which lost the romance subplot and scaled back on Ryan's time.However she is carried by a real star turn from Crowe.  It may not be that clever a role but he does `tough' really well and he helps improve the tension of several scenes.  Morse is a good actor and he does well here. The only downside of his performance is that he seemed fit and well outside of his makeup; I was looking for him to look thinner and mentally battered as the film progressed but he didn't - it's not his fault, I guess the film had no time to do this.  Caruso gives the same tough performance he does in every thing he ever does so if you like that then you'll like him here - I do!Overall this is an enjoyable film if you can get past it's major problems surrounding Alice and Terry's relationship.  Script-wise this aspect was weak on paper, but a comparatively rubbish turn from the miscast Meg Ryan just makes it all the weaker.  Thank god that the basic premise is tense and the male leads' tough talking is good fun.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyODkwNzM3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTc5Nzc5._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The late Chicago film critic Gene Siskel cited it as such during a broadcast of the show he co-hosted with Roger Ebert several years ago. It is not a great film, but has real moments of warmth and humor that are hard to ignore. It's difficult to explain, but what could have been just another vapid action film, is fleshed out by good performances, a self effacing sense of humor, and solid direction.During the opening credits, we meet Nick Parker (Rutger Hauer). Having been blinded during a firefight in Viet Nam, he is taken in by a local hamlet and nursed back to health. The villagers also teach Nick the art of the sword, we get several scenes of his progress in which he becomes a master. Jump ahead twenty years, as Nick wanders down a country road, walking stick in hand. He is on his way to visit an old friend from the war. After a silly scene involving switched hot sauce, Nick arrives to find that his friend, Frank Devereaux (Terry O'Quinn) does not live there anymore, having left for Reno. Well, Nick meets Frank's wife and son Billy (Brandon Call). Enter Slag (the Randall 'Tex' Cobb), who has come to kidnap Frank's son, to force Frank into making designer drugs, so that an evil Reno casino owner can pay off his debts. Anyway, after a especially violent debacle, Nick is sworn to protect Billy, and off they go to Reno to rescue Frank.Admittedly, BLIND FURY is plot heavy, and a lesser film would have sunk under the weight. But the film never gets overly involved with the story, never really takes it to seriously. This is director Phillip Noyce's follow up to DEAD CALM, a tense thriller that put him on the map (he would go on to helm PATRIOT GAMES, SLIVER, THE SAINT). It is a campy ode to samurai pictures and westerns, war movies and ninja chop-em-ups. Noyce sets the right tone and keeps the action moving. Observe the scene, near the end of the film: there is a tense moment when Billy throws a sword to Nick. The sword sails in the air, in slow motion, the music builds and the sword slips right through Nick's hands. It is a wonderfully funny moment. Another important aspect is the character of Nick Parker. As played by Rutger Hauer, Nick is a simple man, not a super hero. He reacts through instinct to the situations he finds himself in, and uses mostly evasive techniques (similar to Jackie Chan), to defend himself. Hauer does a good job blending the realities of blindness with the Hollywood clichÃÂ©s, which makes scenes in which he drives down one-way streets, and the like, very entertaining. The film makers also keep the violence in a backlit, comic book style, never becoming overtly graphic (the antithesis of something like KILL BILL, where the characters dance through geysers of arterial spray). BLIND FURY is an enigma, it is not wacky enough to be considered cult, it does not deal with important subject matter, yet it is still somehow affecting. It will be cast into the discount bins at your local mall, left to languish in obscurity. But for those who will give it a chance, you may be surprised by this standard action fare raised to a higher level by a talented cast and crew. 8/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTU0M2E0MzktN2VhMi00ZjRmLTk2NTUtMzIyMjcyZDkxZDBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

They've had their faces and finger tips carved off. Arkady Renko, an honest, slightly obsessive Russian cop, is assigned to the case.

He finds a girl (Joanna Pacula) who was friends of the trio, a wealthy and ruthless American (Lee Marvin), an American cop (Brian Dennehy) out for blood, and more than he probably wants to know about sable coats and the animals they're made from. It becomes clear that corrupt higher-ups are involved in something with greater stakes than solving a triple murder. Hurt and Marvin do great jobs and are well matched.This is a tight, very well constructed police procedural that is a little exotic, with the cops and functionaries being Russians. It's also a bit gloomy with a bitter sweet ending, but it still works as a very watchable film. A lot of the outdoor shots were filmed in Helsinki, and the movie takes place in the winter. The atmosphere looks cold and oppressive. The contrast is striking with the scenes set in a pre-revolutionary bath and an expensive restaurant, both reserved for the use of privileged Soviet officials. The book, by Martin Cruz Smith, is even better.

If an individual has been subjected to extreme sexual or psychological horror, they might not react in a way that one would ordinarily expect. I think that many people who have commented on this film have failed to recognize this important fact.

Which The Hidden and Shocker were later borrow to the extremely flawed but watchable ""Fallen"" and the campy ""Jason Goes to Hell:The Final Friday"".This film has excellent use of Special Effects, this film was shot on a low budget. Shocker was shot in ten weeks, giving Craven enough time making the film look professional. This film is violent, it has some scares and it contains a memorable gross-out scene, which it was also later used in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol.1. Which it is the infamous lip biting stretching scene.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good-Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. The DVD only has an Original Theatrical Trailer and Production Notes as Extras. The film features an Heavy Metal soundtrack by Megadeth, Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop, Dangerous Toys and Others. The Heavy Metal soundtrack of the film is good. This horror film is well photographed by Jacques Haitkin (Wishmaster). The film has good performances by Berg, Pileggi and Murphy. The film also stars:Cami Cooper as Jonathan's Girlfriend and Victim of Pinker's, Richard Brooks and Ted Raimi. Peter Berg is now a filmmaker (also actor), he has directed the underrated ""Very Bad Things"", an enjoyable action adventure ""The Rundown"" and the true life football drama ""Friday Night Lights"". This is One of Craven's best and One of the most Underrated horror films of the 80's. Watch for Reporter turned Pinalist John Test in a bit role as a T.V. News Archorman. Look fast for Heather Langerkamp in the opening scene as a victim.

The fun part of watching Chan's films are the outrageous action scenes and stunts by The Man, himself. Especially for someone getting up their in age, Chan is incredible since he does his own stunts.In this film, Chan's girlfriend, played by Michelle Yeoh, does her own stunts, too. She is an excellent martial arts talent in her own right and a pretty lady. By the way, during the closing credits they show some of the stunts that went wrong. Not all of these are shown for laughs. In a few of them, Chan is injured.The sound was amazing for a VHS. I can only imagine the stereo on the DVD.

But 30 minutes into the movie and you will be extremely happy with his performance.Mel Gibson has the capacity to express himself exceedingly well through his expressive eyes and although age has done its thing with his face he still manages to live up to the character he portrays in the movie.

""I had to learn to jump start ambulances to get invalids to the dialysis machines."" Joan Cusack and Steve Martin, ""My Blue Heaven.""There's a lot of fun to be found in ""My Blue Heaven,"" a simple little comedy with only good intentions. I find it almost impossible to dislike - it has little offensive material, it isn't a stupid, recycled movie packaged with marketable trimmings. Instead, it is a joyful little flick that knows it is no Oscar winner but still tries to entertain its audience. And it does. ""My Blue Heaven"" is pure heaven for anyone who appreciates fine comedy - it's a little bit wacky, a little bit goofy, and very, very funny.Steve Martin is perfectly cast as the wild and crazy Vincent Antonelli, a Mafia informer who has been entered into the Witness Protection Program. His wife wants no part of their new, cheery life in a suburban America so she leaves him early on. Rick Moranis is equally well-cast as Barney Coopersmith, the FBI agent assigned to protect Vinnie and make sure his new life is suitable to his comfort.Barney's wife has just left him, too. She complains that he is too anal-retentive. She even mentions that he has a technique for getting equal amounts of butter on his waffles. Meanwhile, Vinnie soon tires of his new life and resorts to crime - first little things, such as marking down prices on meat in the local grocery store - which results in the best single line in the entire film, when a perky employee greets Vinnie. His response is a four-letter-word that isn't nearly as (c)rude as it seems it would be at first. Soon he meets up with old partners and crime and they form a new crime syndicate - much to the chagrin of a female police officer named Hannah Stubbs (Joan Cusack), who seems to be the perfect match for Barney Coopersmith.Hannah is unable to prosecute Vinnie because he is a Federal Witness. At first she and Barney hate each other. Then they grow closer. Vinnie watches on with joyful interest. And what makes this movie so enjoyable, in part, is the chemistry between Martin and Moranis. It's their first film together since ""Parenthood."" They're a good duo, and Martin is so out of character here you start to forget it's even him playing an Italian mobster. Compare Vincent Antonelli to Neal Page (Martin's character in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles""), and the difference in not only attitude but mannerisms and levels of intensity is clearly evident. Martin can play the middle-class American white male especially well, but this film clearly shows that he has not left his wacky background in such films as ""The Jerk"" far behind.""My Blue Heaven"" came out the same year as ""Goodfellas"" (1990). It was impeccable timing - at the end of ""Goodfellas"" we are left with the penetrating image of Ray Liotta's character Henry Hill outside a suburban home in a cheery neighborhood which, remarkably, looks exactly like the neighborhood in ""My Blue Heaven."" It could be argued that ""My Blue Heaven"" is an immediate sequel in some senses. Where ""Goodfellas"" left off ""My Blue Heaven"" starts - it just throws in some comedy. Which is why I don't understand its small impact when it first arrived in theaters. (Suffice to say, it sorta flopped.)I own this film on a VHS tape I purchased for $4.99 at Wal-Mart. I found it lying in the bottom of a discount video barrel with no-name titles. There are comedic gems that have gained respect over the years, and then there are comedic gems that have slipped by unnoticed. ""My Blue Heaven"" wasn't very noticed upon its release in 1990, the few critics who saw it seemed not to pay any attention to it. Funny how some of the most joyful comedies slip by. My Blue Heaven"" is a few laughs short of a comic masterpiece.4.5/5.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQ5MTljNzYtYTZmOC00MGMxLTk5NWItMmVhMmZkZGRhYzcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA0MzYwMDY@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In other words, this is an honest review.**Mark my words as I say... This movie, Chennai Express, is a full-on entertainer, and you wont get bored anywhere in the long run. You will not call it ""masala film"" (a famous genre in bollywood since 2010 after release of 'Dabangg' created by movie buffs. Movies for no brainers fall under that genre.) as you walk out of the theaters, because the action and the comedy and the drama... all contain some logic behind them, all are sensible and none are not overdone. It is not like the other crappy mass entertainers like 'Rowdy Rathore', 'Dabangg 2' and Singham. Chennai Express looked promising when its posters and trailer released. Unexpectedly, it kept its promise.Direction: Rohit Shetty proved his best with this. Honestly, this is the second film from the director that I enjoyed. The first being 'Golmaal'. Anyway, the direction is flawless without any glitches.Cast: The performance of the cast is excellent. After watching the film, you WILL say ""Shah Rukh Khan is back in his game"" and you will fall in love with Deepika Padukone. SRK never performed in a mass entertainer or a comedy flick before (as far as I remember), and we thought he wouldn't fit-in to this kind of a role. We, the audiences, are more used to see him acting in serious dramas like 'MNIK', 'KHNH', Chak De! India' and therefore he is famous for such stern dramatic performances. But he delivered an extraordinary performance in this film, which was so unexpected. Deepika, being a Bangalore girl, essayed a South Indian accent in this film. I found out two or three flaws in her accent, in fact anyone who watches South films will do. Still then, you will love accent and her acting is brilliant as always. Nikitin Dheer was a fitted perfectly in his role as a villain, Tangaballi. He has the perfect build and attitude to be called a ""bad-ass"".Music: The background score is very good and original. The songs are catchy, and aren't misplaced.Plot: Adventure/Comedy/Action... all equalized. Won't discuss anymore. Watch it for yourself.Editing & everything else: Two thumbs up!Overall: 10/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGYyNDQxOTEtOTIxYS00M2M3LWFmMzEtNWRmNmIyZTlhOWY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA4NjE0NjEy._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I never saw the qualities they were detecting when I watched this movie back in the day, so I re-viewed it, to see if I got it wrong. Mishima is extremely uninteresting. This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture. The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy. And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.It must be a triumph when you learn you've landed Philip Glass; but then you have to get something out of him. Glasses score offers not a whit of distinction from his other work, nor does it provide the film any perceptible value. In 2010 it should be clear to anyone that Schrader squandered his career on work of no impact or importance (Cat People, AutoFocus, Light Sleeper, Patty Hearst, American Gigolo). He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else. Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM2NWU1NWEtYzBmNC00MDA4LWI2YzQtZTQ1Y2E3NjZhMDJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

His mind gradually slips back into the realm created by his illness, where he replays a key part of his childhood.","179","A much misunderstood film","There are always films that people will either see what the director was going for, or simply won't connect with the film. David Cronenberg's Spider is one of those films.Many comparisons can be made between this film and the Ron Howard film A Beautiful Mind in that they both examine the complexities of mental illness. Whereas Howard took the glamorous Hollywood style approach -- complete with government agents and associated adventures -- Cronenberg continues to prove that less is more when it comes to film. Spider is significantly more effective in that it does not candy coat its subject, rather approaching the scenario with brute realism.Cronenberg is certainly one of the most under-appreciated and misunderstood directors of our age in terms of popular appeal. His films are not for mass marketing and popcorn sales, but rather are psychologically and sociologically challenging to the viewer. Cronenberg films generally demand a surrender from the audience to an unsettling reality, and Spider is no different. The fractured perception offered by the protagonist as displayed through Cronenberg's eye is truly unique and refreshing.If you are the type of person who is up for quick, easy entertainment, Spider is not your film. But, if you want to explore a brilliantly crafted submergence into the strange reality of a mentally ill person, Spider will leave you wanting more. Cronenberg has once again proved that there are few directors of his talent and skill. His ability to create a wholly original feel in film incomparable to any of his contemporaries is always welcomed by this viewer.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEwODllMWQtMzA3Mi00M2Y5LTkwMzQtYTFiOTAzZTQ5MzRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

One of the film's finest points is the fact that there's a rather large connection to the way it absorbs modern society in the current day and age. This one starts off immediately with this type of brazenly modern social media-obsessed culture where the girls set their trap and knock out the supposed killer before taunting him with their lingo and fan- girl mindset that gives them the appearance of being quite in-depth with modern society. That this one features them so continuously on their blog, focusing on hashtags and getting their posts out onto the world that it delves so deeply into the modern world that it resonates incredibly well due to that factor. The screens showcasing the different messages or tweets for their work that it furthers this even more, and it manages to give this a really strong stylistic look that gives this one a nice feel. Even with all this work to tie it into the modern culture, there's still the horror elements at present here which are pretty accomplished and manage quite a lot to like. The initial stalking in the woods at the bridge is a rather straightforward affair, but the remaining scenes are played more for black comedy with the way these teenage girls can overcome and overpower their much larger, more powerful victims gives this a comic edge. From the way in which they start the massacre at the school garage to the ambush at the gym where they take down their biggest obstacle yet, these more horrific scenes intended to be funny give this a strong and overall like to like feel when coupled with the rather enjoyable technological connections. The finale at the prom manages to generate a lot of fun by really letting loose with a fun time while offering the more action-packed stalking and chasing to come full-circle while also giving the film a really engaging and strong finish which is quite a rousing way to finish. These here manage to give this one a lot to really enjoy while it does have a few minor issues to be had here. While it does generate a lot to like, there's a few flaws here. The most noticeable issue is the fact that there's no accounting for how the police go about their investigation here as there's no reason why they couldn't have figured out who's doing the killings. The fact that they run such a blog at the particular time this occurs gives them such a red flag that it's almost impossible why they're not targeted sooner in the investigation, and it turns even more obvious once they get to the different bodies found around the town. Even more obvious is their cold and callous attitude after everything, and how they always seem to be in the right spot at the right time is way too suspicious to ignore so their antics only seems to be that way in order to keep the film going. Some of the effects-work in the kills look off with the blood-splatter being way too fake, but overall it's not that bad of an issue.Rated Unrated/R: Extreme Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGYzZGZlYmUtYjRkNy00MmJiLWI5YjktYWQ3NmQ0MWQ3M2I5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjEwNTM2Mzc@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I don't know if you have to be under 25 to ""get"" this movie but we definitely felt like we had been on the craziest ride of our lives. As for me, part of me felt like I kept getting slapped in the face, part of me felt like I kept falling in love with Eddie Redmayne, part of me felt like I was super-uncomfortable but was dying to see what was going to happen next and a really big part of me couldn't believe how good of an actress Chloe Moretz is, at only 13 or 14 or whatever.I don't think I've ever seen a girl that age be that good, yes, TRUE GRIT included. Honest. Chloe Moretz in HICK makes that girl from TRUE GRIT look like a one-note wonder. Dare you to see it and disagree. Dare you.The other thing I couldn't help but notice is that Blake Lively can actually act. And she's good. I know. I thought she sucked, too. But she's really, really good in this movie. (Even better than in THE TOWN.)I only know Alec Baldwin from 30 Rock and my dad hating him but I thought he was excellent in the film. I've only see him do comedy so this was really different. Maybe he should do more dramatic roles because he was really interesting in this one.I loved the costumes in the film, I just wanted to be a part of this world in a weird way. I don't want to spoil the end of the movie but, put it this way, we were all crying. It was embarrassing, really.We were all crazy about the film and I even bought the book after, which I read super-fast. I, then, gave the book to my best friend and she read it and now she won't even give it back. I don't know. I think HICK is the only thing I've seen, or read, in a long time that seems to have anything to do with me. Everything else is all about vampires or comic-books or people sawing each other in half. I love this film because it was like nothing I'd ever seen before but I really felt like it was happening, thanks to the amazing acting of everyone but especially Chloe Moretz.I just read that this film is coming out in theaters and I'm extremely excited because I can't wait to see it again. I recommend this film to anyone under 25 or to anyone that is a girl, or maybe a gay guy. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone like my parents, though.

Dutton, Jada Pinkett Smith, Salli Richardson-Whitfield","7,798","An ex-cop, now a private detective, takes on the search for the millions stolen by a drug lord.","32","If you take this seriously then you're totally missing the point!","A Low Down Dirty Shame is really no more than all the most familiar Cop movie clichÃÂ©s arranged in an order that makes a barely cohesive story. But it's all the fun and silly action that occurs in between that really matters! It's a bit like The Last Boy Scout from a spoof-blaxploitation angle.Shame (Keenan Ivory Wayans) is a former cop who has been blackballed after a major drugs bust went awry, leaving several DEA agents dead. He now works as a private detective, taking on suicide missions for peanuts and barely scraping by. His disapproving secretary Peaches (a very funny and very, very small Jada Pinkett) wants him to get his act together but he's too busy wallowing in self-pity.His old pal from the DEA shows up and offers him a side mission to help get back at the Drug Kingpin who ruined his career. And so, with only a few clues, Shame begins his search and soon all roads lead to lies and deception. Like I said, the plot is certainly nothing special. But it does contain a helluva lot of laughs and decent action.The one thing I can complain of is that the production design is kind of dated now. Action films have evolved so much in the past decade that watching ALDDS 12 years on can be a bit distracting. Wayans (who also directs as well as writing and starring) too often shoots non-actions scenes like a sitcom and his light-hearted editing may help remind you that this totally AIN'T a serious film but it's a little TV-ish if you know what I mean.If you find ALDDS for cheap somewhere or if it's showing on TV then don't con yourself out of a fun movie. High art is not what this film aims to be.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmE2Y2FmNmEtNzc5OC00OTUyLThlY2QtODQ4NTI4OTJhMzAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ3NzUxOTM@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

For me, this is just a fun-loving group of comedians that love to make their audience laugh, or at least try their damnedest. I had the pleasure of attending the Canadian premiere of the ""Slammin' Salmon"" in Montreal recently and the Broken Lizard troupe was there to meet and greet the fans and answer questions after the movie. They are true class acts and friendly guys. While I won't give away any specific jokes I will say that from a fan's perspective, this is their second funniest film, with Supertroopers of course being the cult favourite. So yes, it is an improvement on Beerfest; the Slammin' Salmon is just straight up funnier. As for regular movie-goers and comedy fans, I highly recommend this film. It was produced with a low budget during the writers' strike, so without a big studio production, it has the fast pacing of a stage show. The focus in this movie is on the JOKES... which is something refreshing to see in a comedy; less emphasis on character development and a complex plot, but more emphasis on keeping the audience consistently laughing. The humour is low brow at times, but is also clever and well-timed, there are many quick one-liners so pay sharp attention to this fast paced comedy, enjoy!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyODk2NTU3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM5OTIwMw@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

When she and her family are attacked by a stranger one night, Betriek sets out to find an explanation. She discovers that something is chasing her.","57","creative use of Dutch elements, but also a lot of reuse of horror clichÃÂ©s","Moloch is a new horror film directed and partly written by Nico van den Brink. For this film he has only directed short films. This is his first directing work for a film that lasts longer than an hour. The film is about Betriek (Sallie Harmsen), who lives on the edge of a peat swamp. Strange things happen in the neighborhood where she lives, from a dead person to strange figures that walk around her house in the evening. Betriek goes to investigate, to discover what is going on. Together with the foreign agent Jonas (Alexandre Willaume), she learns about the mythical history of the peat swamp that is bewitched by an evil spirit, who harass surrounding residents with her presence. Together, Betriek and Jonas must try to stop this evil force before more victims fall. With this film Nico van de brink tries to make a real Dutch horror film, which makes use of typical Dutch features such as the Veen. They use historical elements such as the story of the girl from Ede. They manage to incorporate this element in the film in a creative way, but otherwise they copy many elements from other horror films. These copied moments come from lesser-known horror films, but a horror connoisseur can still recognize the moments. For them, this film is so familiar without really creating tension. In the end, it can come off as a long-winded movie. Nico van den Brink and co-writer Daan Bakker should have come up with more unique horror elements of their own, to have had a more extraordinary Dutch horror film. The visual effects are often not believable. For suspense it works better if the ghost stays in the background or in the darkness, but when the ghost comes into view more clearly you can see that this was placed in the film with CGI. This lowers the credibility and subsequently the tension level. The props they use for the bog bodies seem credible, but unfortunately little is done with them. Due to the quality of the film, the acting isn't really special either. Sallie Harmsen and Alexandre Willaume do well as the lead roles, but sometimes the film seems to be more about their relationship than the mystery of the peat swamp. The rest of the film cast also doesn't get much material to work with in the film and come across more as extras to produce the story.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYmM3NTQtYTU5OC00ZDY1LTgxNzktNDFlMjc2ODUxYTIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUwOTc4Mjk@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

But forget about all the tropes and visuals that are associated with this genre, it is instead focused on what for me is the essential element of Gothic literature: The dead are alive. This doesn't seem like much to build a narrative on, and the driving force of ""Pretty"" indeed is not plot, nor characters, nor the solving of a mystery. And while all three things are embedded into its narrative it is first and foremost a tone poem. An important thing about the the-dead-are-alive notion, especially in this film, is that it goes both ways. The living can sense the presence of the dead (AKA ghosts), but the dead actually live on after their death, probably mostly concerned with reliving their past, but they might also be able to sense the living. So who is haunting who?Consequently ""Pretty"" presents a ghost story within a ghost story, to put it in simplified terms. In more concrete terms the plot concerns Lily, a nurse who stays in the house of elderly horror fiction writer Iris Blum, to take care of her until her death, which shouldn't be too far into the future now. But it also wouldn't be too wrong to say that the main character is the house that had a few occupants over the course of its lifetime. I don't mean this in the tired old this-and-that-place-is-like-another-character-in-the-film way, the personality of the house certainly is made up of all the people who lived in it. But writer-director Oz Perkins takes the expression ""If these walls could talk"" and makes it a reality. It is about the people who lived in the house (or more correctly the people who died in it), but for all intents and purposes the main character is the house itself.""Pretty"" starts with nurse Lily's first day at the house and her opening narration tells us that she just turned 28 years old, but that she will never be 29. She talks about death, memory and says ""From where I am now, I can be sure of only a very few things."" One of those things is her name. So right from the beginning we know that Lily (at least Lily as a narrator) is already dead. Logic dictates that what we see on screen are her hazy memories of her short time in the house. Can we trust her words and can we trust what we see? In any case, old Iris Blum doesn't talk much. But she keeps calling Lily by the name of Polly. And Lily seems to sense some ghostly presence in the house. Polly, as we soon learn, is the main character of Blum's most famous novel ""The Lady in the Walls"", a novel of which Blum said it lacks an ending because of ""an obligation to be true to the subject"" for Polly didn't tell Blum about her ending, but Blum tells us that she is convinced that ""as endings go, Polly's was not an especially pretty one."" Incidentally there also slowly emerges an ugly, moldy stain on one of the walls in the house that Lily grows concerned about. Is there some connection? Perkins leaves the viewer in the dark for most of the film's running time about the concrete connections between all the characters, as slow and eventless as the whole thing is it is difficult to keep track of all the points of view. For example Lily isn't the only one whose voice-over we hear, we also hear and see young Blum as she writes the novel, and we hear and see Polly. Those voices also aren't particularly easy to distinguish, and it gets even more complicated when scaredy cat Lily finally dares to pick up ""The Lady in the Walls"" to read at least parts of it, the content of which is told from both Blum's and Polly's point of view. Through the viewer's natural desire to know the answers the film evokes ideas on the way as we contemplate all the possible answers. Did Polly really exist? Is she buried behind the wall? Are Lily and Polly somehow the same person? Is Lily a fictional character altogether? Or is Lily only imagining things? Like a poem or a song it evokes first and foremost a tone, a mood, and sparks ideas of what it might be about. It takes further readings/listens to find that in between all the lines it actually tells a story, a simple story perhaps, but nevertheless a story. And this is actually how 'I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House' worked for me. The tone and the ideas immediately took hold of me, but it took me two viewings to really make sense of the narrative. This isn't without its drawbacks, because frankly it isn't so much difficult to follow because it floods you with information that you need to sort out, on the contrary, it basically is so eventless that it poses a challenge to stay attentive for the whole time. This was, however, clearly a conscious choice by Perkins, and his approach is nothing if not consequential. But it makes criticisms of the film being ""boring"" particularly understandable in this case, ""Pretty"" indeed is very one-note, and unless it is a note you relish or that you learn to relish, it won't be enough for you to satisfyingly get you through a whole feature film.As it turned out after two viewings, the solution to the mystery is quite concrete and surprisingly not at all convoluted. Nevertheless the ending for me is as chilling as it is simple, and it beautifully circles back onto itself, like a chorus that keeps coming back, just what you would expect a story told by a ghost to be.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmM1MzFiOTAtNGQ5MS00ZTgzLTg4YmEtZDhlZmY3YjUzNGNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjU3OTg4NzA@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

How can you possibly cast a movie, however badly written, and not find people who have chemistry with each other? The two characters, Sahra and Deniz, are in conflict for the entire first half of the movie, which is typical for many scripts, but the writing is boring. Early on, Sahra makes a bet that endangers her career, but the character is not stupid enough to make such a bet, so it rings inauthentic. The two actresses playing the grandmothers are extremely weak, worse than the other two. Deniz's friend is adequate, and probably the best actor in this subpar movie. The actress playing Sahra's grandmothers character is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen act.The only redeeming value of the film is the scenery, which is shown a few times in the first half of the movie, which is as far as I've gotten. I'm willing to update this after seeing more of this horrible film just to complete the review, but I really don't imagine being able to recommend it.You have a problem with a script If in your movie, the two characters who are in the major conflict cannot even speak to each other, which is the case for one of the two characters in the story. One talks, and the other one doesn't say a thing at some points. I won't reveal who (big surprise!). When characters undergo personal growth during a story, there is of necessity some sort of natural feeling of transition in them that occurs over a period of time in several scenes. In this movie, they decided to do it all at once, with no believable prologue.I am generally skeptical of watching movies that have been out for some time and only have a few hundred ratings.

Where Silent Light emphasized the emptiness of these people's lives - with varying degrees of success or failure, depending on your own tastes - OUATIA merely seems to replicate a formula that ""worked"" and distances us unnecessarily from what could have been gripping and intriguing characters. The fact that we spend more time on pointless wide shots, shots of a car dashboard or a dirty window than on the actors' interesting faces speaks volumes about the missed opportunities this approach creates. Buried under the ponderous style is an intriguing story dying to be told.More damning still, the film feels like a short film plot stretched past the 2 and a half hour mark, where we are subjected to scenes that baffle by their mere presence: every time someone moves from point A to point B we are made to watch, and observe moments that would have been cut in any other film. Again, this could have been interesting had the focus remained on the characters, but more often than not, this is not the case.The film is ultimately undone by relying on the principle that if you watch emptiness or something meaningless for long enough, you will fill in blanks yourself by projecting subjective meaning... or just walk away and find better ways to spend your time.Sloppy film-making, and all the worse for the compelling film it could have been.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3OTMyODQ1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMwMTEwNw@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

There's also a terrific performance from Gabriel Olds Ã¢ÂÂ this is virtually a two-hander. It reminded me of the film Room which has a similar theme, but I found this to be better and more involving in that I got completely lost in it in that rare way that makes for a special viewing experience.

There are some trademark zingers you'd anticipate from the Oscar's favorite MC:  ""Sixty pounds?  That's a Backstreet Boy."" The cast is superb.  Hank Azaria, like always, steals the show.  He is absolutely hilarious as Catherine Zeta-Jones' new Spanish lover.  There is a great scene near the end where he gets outraged at a rumor of his inadequate ""size.""  Just like his role as the flamboyant butler in ""The Birdcage"" he brings out tons of laughs, taking on a phony accent.  He really is a man of extraordinary talent.  John Cusack shows us his more...goofy side.  I've always enjoyed him in past movies, but he usually plays the straight man. This was something different.  Well, I guess you can say he plays the straight man, but he stumbles into all sorts of slapstick situations that causes him to overreact in comic fashions.  And he's great at it!  Julia Roberts is...well...Julia Roberts.  I have nothing against Julia, but I don't patronize her in the same way others do.  I don't think she's the most beautiful woman and I don't think she's the most brilliant actress.  But I'm sure many were looking forward to this movie because of Julia, and if you're one of those people, you won't be disappointed.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is extremely beautiful, but she is so great as the whiny, bitchy ex-wife of Cusack/spoiled actress that I wanted to stab her every moment she was on screen.  Alan Arkin is funny as the pretentious, preposterous spiritual healer.  There is a great deleted scene with him and Cusack over the phone, while Arkin rides the streets of Vegas in a pink convertible.  Those renting the DVD--don't skip the deleted scenes!  And last but not least, Christopher Walken (Da Man!) has a brief but memorable appearance as reclusive director Hal Wideman.Don't expect any surprises.  The story's as predictable as can be.  The whole movie is superficial fluff.  But it's enjoyable superficial fluff.

This movie however is back on track, keeping a good pace of events and complexity.If you have already followed Salander and Blomkvist during the previous books/movies, you will surely enjoy watching how the conspiracy is being unraveled through intense investigations and court trials. You will experience how the opposition crumble beneath Salander and Blomkvists combined efforts at exposing and confronting the deeper reasons for Salanders struggles, and how they piece the puzzle together to clear her name and taking down the shady factions of society.The movie has a nice level of well thought out detail, but also a several logical breaches. You leave the cinema with a feeling of wanting to know much more about how the initial conspiracy evolved and how parts of the investigation (not involving the key characters) is carried out. This is likely due to the dept of Stieg Larssons books, being impossible to portrait in just 150 swift minutes. This may eventually be a teaser lurking me into reading the books.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NTY3NjMwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI1MjQwNA@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Some old folk I spoke to as a kid told me that when they were kids there were no gangs of youths on the streets: there were gangs of men. After the second world war, we began to see the emergence of youth crime. It has grown since then, practically spiralling out of control.When we look at this film from the frame of reference of the early twenty-first century, this film where the London underworld joins with the police to track down the killer of a policeman looks unreal. If you have read any of the reminiscences of police officers of the period (such as Robert Fabian's ""Fabian of the Yard"") you will see that this sort of relationship between the police and the underworld is right on the button. This is the sort of thing that would have happened.The type of policing that this film portrays belongs to a bygone era, when criminals often didn't have cars to make their getaways. It also shows the advantage of the beat copper, who knows his beat so well that if there is anything unusual he notes it down, and if there is any trouble, he has a fair idea of who is causing it. And the pair played by Jimmy Hanley and Jack Warner showed perfectly the inexperienced learning from the experienced. The situations, such as the costermonger being continually told to ""move along there"" are real for then but not for now, when police work, once done using discretion, is now, like everything else, done by bureaucracy.The film is shot in north London, in the Paddington, Maida Vale and Westbourne Park areas. P C Dixon's beat is round by the Grand Union Canal in an area known as Little Venice. The police station is the old Paddington Green station, which has since been knocked down and replaced by a new one on the Edgware Road.What you must not do is watch this film and judge it by today's standards. I am old enough to know that the social conditions portrayed in this film are as realistic as it gets; and so is the way the police operate.An excellent film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzNzcxNDM0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc5ODgwMzE@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This is also one of the relatively few movies before the late 1950s that I can recall that really (purport to) go out into the British countryside: The Clouded Yellow is another example - and a similar style of movie to this (and also very good). Aside from these, I can think of only the Scottish scenes in The 39 Steps, I Know Where I'm Going, How Green Was My Valley, The Stars Look Down. (Suddenly in the late 1950s/1960s, British movies exploded out of London and went a-venturing - in such as This Sporting Life, Look Back in Anger, Tunes of Glory, A Kind of Loving, Room at the Top, Billy Liar, Whistle Down the Wind, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, Becket, The Lion in Winter, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, Tom Jones, Get Carter, Alfie).Like The Clouded Yellow, this is the kind of movie patented by Hitchcock - filled with psychological suspense, fast moving plot, attractive actors, physical danger, significant looks, deception.

Between the simple conflicts, cardboard characters, and stiflingly slow dialog almost entirely erected off of carbon-copy dramas, it shows its agonizingly long roots by taking every possible scenario and stretching it to a length beyond maddening tedium. There's almost no need to even write a review on this picture, because if you're not turned off by the name ""Tyler Perry,"" you're likely turned off by the amateur cast the film boasts, the dopey plot(s), or the presence of the always wooden, never charismatic Kim Kardashian.Tyler Perry's films have been a roller-coaster for a non-fan like myself. I believe his pictures almost demand the audience to have ability to relate too its characters on screen, and if you don't, then you've demolished one of the crucial ways of being able to like the film as a whole. But if you even if you do have the relatable factor down, there are still a number of other characteristics of his pictures that will do the job of turning you off. The abundance of clichÃÂ©s, stereotypes, senseless slapstick, religious motives, and ridiculous characters is enough to warrant a walk-out. The film stars Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Lance Gross as Judith and Brice, childhood sweethearts that are married in an upper-class area. She is a matchmaker, working to become a full-time marriage counselor, while he is a pharmacist and a successful one at that. After six years of marriage, Judith becomes greatly unsatisfied by the drab life she is living, and in due-time because she meets Harley (Robbie Jones), an immensely successful, social-networking pioneer who is in dire need of a woman. From first sight, Judith is mesmerized by his confidence, money, and ability to talk a woman up as big as the house he lives in. We see where this is going, but Judith, who appears very bright and focused - with a mind similar to Kimberly Elise's character in Diary of a Mad Black Woman - doesn't. Soon, they are sneaking around, having sexual fun together, while she is being showered with gifts, all while trying to remain indiscreet to Brice.This is the immediate problem of Tyler Perry's Temptation; there are no likable characters (except Brice), no characters with any intelligent judgment, and no characters that extend themselves past formulaic and dull. Take Judith for example, who we are allegedly supposed to sympathize with, even during the instances when she is cheating. We're just supposed to think, ""well, it's justifiable since she's upset and Brice doesn't stand up for her as a man should."" There's no justification for cheating, but the film makes it out to be up until things go really, really wrong.It's, too, relevant that the film loves making ordeals out of petty non-issues such as Brice not standing up for Judith when she is cat-called by a group of thugs on their night out. Judith proceeds to go to bed angry and embarrassed by her husband's lack of gall to defend her or even initiate something. A scene not long after shows Harley almost beating a cyclist to a pulp after running into Judith when she was clearly at fault. Is he how men should behave? The film tries to show us that, even though his actions are grossly immature compared to Brice's, he's better because he at least tries.Tyler Perry's Temptation fails in large part, however, because of its writing. It is an early candidate for the worst written film of the year. It runs on the fuel of inane dialog, corny lines, and senseless drama. Take for example the scene when Harley and Judith are on his private plane, and Harley questions what Judith ""dreams about."" When she responds, she ricochets the question off of him, to which he replies, ""of you?"" in a delivery that is akin to primetime soap operas. I can't remember cringing harder to a line of dialog. Then there's a scene where Judith is found battered in a bathtub. When Brice asks her, ""where does it hurt?"" she replies, ""here,"" while placing her hand on his heart. To see the audience eat scenes up like this makes me deeply, deeply scared to think they have romantic expectations probably not alien to the kind in this film.The leads aren't dreadful here, as Smollett-Bell and Gross are the kind of actors you crave to watch in better material, but the presence of reality-TV star Kim Kardashian in a film is about as off-putting and as tasteless as the persona she gives on that godforsaken program of her's. Why must Kardashian inhabit a secondary role in this film, let alone a role at all? Why not find a bodacious woman with huge breasts, a huge buttocks, and wildly unrealistic curves with no celebrity appeal for half the price? Perry's name alone is big enough to sell the most lurid screenplay/movie, so why work a role for her? It doesn't matter, though; I'm wasting words. She's about as unappealing and cloying as a secondary character played by an unnecessary celebrity can get. It will take a performance of a true despicable nature to dethrone her from a ""Worst New Actress"" award at the forthcoming Razzies.Tyler Perry's Temptation is a sermon that will effectively preach to the choir that has graciously accepted every film he has released since Diary of a Mad Black Woman back in 2005. However, it has become clear now that public success is all that matters to Perry. He no longer seems to have ambition to make films that cater to a denominator other than the lowest or the most demanding. He attempts to get by on melodramatic clichÃÂ©s, laughable dialog, moral preachiness, inclusions of a sappy Christian agenda, and frustratingly inert plotpoints. I wish him well, and hope one day I can recommend a movie by him. I respect him as a self-made filmmaker, but that's about it, I'm afraid.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzIwMTk0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM4NDI4OA@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Mary Shelly's ""Frankenstein"" is one of the stories that has helped to shape horror cinema, and so the story behind it is guaranteed to interest horror fans. This film isn't exactly the story of how the story came to fruition; but rather a compilation of ideas surrounding ""what could have happened"" (but quite clearly didn't). The film takes influence from the enigmatic Lord Byron more than anything, and it's always him that springs to mind as we watch the small cast delve into their imaginations, culminating in an orgy of sex and violence. The story is simple, and focuses more on imagery and the ideas behind what is happening on screen. We follow Percy Shelly and his wife to be, Mary; along with her sister Claire, who travel to the self-exiled home of Lord Byron. While there, the four of them; along with Byron's biographer, decide to indulge in the art of making up ghost stories. However, the fun gets out of hand when the quintet begins to believe that they have actually created a monster.The film has a very 'intellectual' flavour, but the fact is that there isn't a lot below the surface of this film. Gothic, to me at least, is a visual treat rather than food for thought - with Ken Russell's imagery providing more than any deep and complex substance. The imagery is stunning, and fits into the film very well. Russell's sets compliment the story excellently, and the atmosphere in which the film takes place is more important than the story itself. Lord Byron's house is almost a character within itself, and when combined with the actual characters; Russell has provided horror fans with a very surreal film indeed. The cast is excellent. Films with a small cast rely more on their actors, and this film certainly doesn't fall down in that respect. Gabriel Byrne leads the cast, and does an excellent job of holding the film together. Julian Sands, Natasha Richardson, Myriam Cyr and Timothy Spall, who all portray their characters excellently, join him. On the whole; I can easily see why people dislike this film; as it's somewhat messy, and doesn't adhere to common horror standards - but if you like your horror different, this is highly recommended.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZlN2UwYmUtMmRmMy00NzY5LTgyYjItNTk5NjQwZWM3MzJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

There should be plenty of double entendres (and single entendres!), plenty of bosoms heaving out across the audience, and a plot that is as uncomplicated as the sexual positions are complicated.For the most part, '3D Sex & Zen: Extreme Ecstasy' is that film. Extremely handsome boy meets extremely beautiful girl. They make a lot of love, but something's not right. So, the handsome boy goes off to consult various masters in hopes of improving things. That's the first half of the film. Rather unfortunately, the second half turns to violence, sadism, rape and torture, and where five minutes ago one was chuckling about the protagonist declaring ""I must make love to ten women at the same time"", suddenly one is faced with genital mutilation, followed by rape, then more genital mutilation, followed by... Well, you get the idea with that one.I suppose a film has to go in a direction, and a sex film especially, once the thrill of seeing the actors and actresses naked has waned somewhat. It can become increasingly absurd and nihilistic, like many Russ Meyer films; change tack and take in another exploitation genre (such as, ummm, 'Zombie Strippers'?); or go for a message, which more often than not is 'actually, this much sex isn't that good for you' (take 'Austin Powers', if you will). 3D Sex & Zen goes somewhere between all three, and despite being about 20 minutes too long, somehow fails to deliver satisfactorily on any count.The message that it does have is sweet, however, and understandable to people of all nations. And there's something charming about the fact that in Hong Kong, 3D Sex & Zen made more than Avatar on its opening day. Overall, it's worth a watch, perhaps more for what it is than what it says.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzMTgyNDI0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkzNzExNg@@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Because I knew it was a New Zealand import from years ago, I never even bothered trying to locate a copy. So when it called out to me months later from the shelves in the video shop, I felt eerily compelled to rent it. I watched it by myself in the wee hours of the morning--and it could not have been more ideal.An Angel at My Table is the story of New Zealand's famous writer, Janet Frame. Fairly long, but never boring, it is told in three 50 minute interludes, taking us through her impoverished childhood, awkward adolescence, and the terrifying and eventually triumphant years that follow: Janet was a plump little girl, with an unruly mop of bright red hair. She was fascinated with books and stories at an early age ~ a friend had lent her a copy of Grimm's which she treasured. A certificate of merit in grade school allowed her the use of the public library where she became even more immersed in literature. Despite financial hardships, her father managed to buy her a journal ""for her writings."" By her late teens she was no longer plump, but a rather crippling shyness had set in. At social functions she played the wallflower. She preferred to be by herself, where she could nurture her passion for creating stories. She went on to become a teacher (though the idea no longer appealed to her), and suffered a panic attack when a supervisor ""sat in"" on one of her classes. It was advised that Janet have a psychiatric evaluation--a misdiagnosis of schizophrenia (later changed to nothing more than shyness and depression) landed her in a mental institution for eight years of electric shock therapy, each session she narrated to be: ""equal in fear to that of an execution."" She was scheduled for a partial lobotomy when news reached her doctors that she had won a national literary award--during her hospitalization her sister had published a book of Janet's short stories. She was almost immediately released under the premise that a talented author couldn't possibly need the treatment she had been receiving....At this point Janet was in her late twenties, but her lengthy ""exile"" had given the impression that she was considerably younger than that. A friend of the family's, another writer who admired her work, offered her a cottage on his property so that she could write seriously in a distraction-free environment. She accepted the offer and her first completed work there was accepted soon after. European travels were arranged for her, more successful books were born, and fame attained...I've heard it claimed that Janet had also attained happiness, but I am not sure that I agree. Janet had found numerous freedoms, emotional and financial and of course physical, but happiness? I believe that she had become comfortable with herself, and perhaps that in itself is a happiness. She never did fit into the surrounding world--but lived peacefully alone on the vaporous outskirts. A very supportive therapist in London had told her, ""If people tell you that you should go out there and mix, and you don't feel like it,...don't."" She took his words to heart.I was surprised with the overall beauty of this film~I guess I  should not have been~the director was Jane Campion (The Piano, Portrait of a Lady). The New Zealand landscapes and backstreets of Spain were gorgeously rendered, the accompanying score at times both capricious and melancholy. But above all, what struck me most, was how I identified with Janet. The plump and impoverished childhood, the obsession with writing, the painful shyness and reclusiveness. The life of the outsider~luckily minus the stay in the psychiatric ward. On some level I was Janet (or am Janet). And there is something oddly redemptive in finding a twin on screen or in a book, however juvenile the notion...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGViMGM0ZGItMWRkOC00NjA5LWE0MDgtNWJjZTJjMjk5ZmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyOTc@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Omnibus films are always a problem, but I have always had a keen interest in them. I will now rate the segments individually.Nicolas Roeg - ""Un ballo in maschera"" - This segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follow, mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a hackneyed one, at that). The photography is unaccomplished. The best thing about it is the bit of Lesbian homoerotica that it never does enough with. This segment made me VERY nervous about continuing. 2/10.Charles Sturridge - ""La virgine degli angeli"" - an unclear segment, but it hardly matters. The film has the best cinematography of the bunch, mainly because it is in a stunning black and white. The segment is dreamlike and beautiful. 7/10.Jean-Luc Godard - ""Armide"" - I chose to brave this much-maligned film for the Godard and Altman segments. With Godard, I was much more impressed than I thought I would be. I can't claim to have seen all that many of his films since he made so many that almost no one has seen, but, judging from what I have seen, this may be his best work since the 60s. It is the funniest segment in this film, and the most artistically accomplished. Bravo, Jean-Luc! 9/10.Julien Temple - ""Rigoletto"" - a very funny segment, it is also quite predictable. Still, this story about a husband and wife who are cheating on each other at the same resort is wonderfully filmed with long, complex tracking shots that depend on precisely timed choreography from the actors. It also has a great self-referencing joke about omnibus films themselves. The final scene is very weak. 7/10.Bruce Beresford - ""Die tote Stadt"" - this short segment involves too lovers in (I think) Venice. It is pretty, with some nice shots of doves flying about the city. It is slight, but nice. 7/10.Robert Altman - ""Les BorÃÂ©ades"" - not one of the better segments, unfortunately, this is more of a music video than a concept short film. It involves the occupants of an insane asylum attending a theatrical performance. The music and images work well together, so at least I can give it credit for being a good music video. 7/10Franc Roddam - ""Liebestod"" - somewhat unfortunate for Beresford's segment, this segment is very similar to it. As you might assume from my phrasing, this one struck me much more. It is about a young man and his girl going to Las Vegas on a fatalistic voyage. 8/10.Ken Russell - ""Nessun dorma"" - maybe the most visually striking segment, it plays in a fantasy world more than in reality. It is a beautiful tale of a fallen angel. 8/10.Derek Jarman - ""Depuis le jour"" - I have heard a lot about Jarman, and this is the first piece of filmmaking I have seen from him. Hopefully, I'll see more in the future. This one is also music-videoish, but it is better than Altman's segement. It mainly concerns an old woman remembering her younger days. The editing and the use of different film stocks to represent both time and emotion are very beautiful. 8/10.Bill Bryden - ""I pagliacci"" - the sad clown, possibly one of the most famous arias (particularly memorable from an episode of Seinfeld), this serves as the material separating each segement and the finale. It is simple and effective. 7/10.Overall, I give it a solid 7/10. It isn't anywhere near as bad as you've heard.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2QwNGQyNGYtY2I5NC00ZDRhLTliMDQtYTMzNzY1YjYyYjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This movie certainly doesn't deserve the bashing it's getting.I was especially impressed with the young supporting cast including Kat Dennings, Johnny K. Lewis and Dana Davis. Not to mention John Corbett who by far was one of the greatest things in this film.I cared...I cried...and when it was all over I honestly felt inspired.I give this film a 6 out of 10...because it makes u care..it really does.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTIyYWMyNjQtNjQxYS00ZmZiLTg1OWItNmVlZTJiY2NkNzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUyNjc3NDQ4._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

On the contrary, Born Losers is Laughlin's take on the war in Viet-Nam and the effects it had on ""normal"" middle-America. The motorcycle gang in the film is a symbol of military forces who take-over a town (representing Viet-Nam) and go on a brutal spree of violence and rape. What causes these seemingly normal men to act in such brutal manners? Are there goods guys and bad guys? No, just people caught up in a ""cruel"" world of hopelessness, acting out their most primal instincts. Laughlin makes sure not to fit his characters into ""good"" and ""evil"", but incorporate a little of both in each person. Laughlin's character fights fire with fire, and it seems to say that there are no-rules in war. Controversial to say the least. The movie bombed at the box-office when first released in 1967. After the amazing success of Billy Jack, it was re-released and showed a pretty-profit.A strong supporting cast of ""B"" movie legends-Elizabeth James, Jerome Slate, Robert Tessier, Jack Starrett along with a ""faded"" Jane Russell, make Born Losers one of the more outstanding independent movies of the 1960s.Born Losers is a Born Winner.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGFkZmZkNWYtOGU5NC00Mjg4LWIwYjMtZTI0NThjNzc2MTliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA0MzYwMDY@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

See not very subtle). Is anyone really stupid enough to believe this showing is even remotely related to actual capitalism? A trillion-dollar company, calling literal slaves their ""employees"", can do anything they want because the employee ""didn't read the fine print"" when signing their introduction paperwork. This director is one of those people who think modern day employees are slaves because they have to work for money instead of being handed everything for free. That even though the employees willing volunteered to work for the company and can leave at any time, the company is evil for making the person work. These kind people think of themselves as actual slaves, like the man in this movie, and there's nothing they can do to escape. That companies who make their employees work are literal slave masters forcing people to work so they aren't killed. Nevermind how incredibly obvious the metaphor, it's also just extremely inaccurate. However, I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1 because there is something to said about quotas and how there are definitely companies that do not reward employees that work hard and therefore give no incentive to continue working hard. That is a legitimate critique. Also, the ending was absolutely terrible. All that aside, Lil Rey cannot carry a movie by himself. He is comedic relief and that is where he shines.

I sit here this morning, having sat through ZOOLANDER last night, watching a complacent, pre-programmed brain-dead audience guffaw itself senseless, contributing another truck load of dollars to Ben Stiller's superannuation fund and you know, I wonder about RAISE THE TITANIC. What has happened to sentiment, simplicity, the ultimately simple values in life?Sure, RAISE THE TITANIC captures none of the power of Cussler's novel, but I don't really care! Yeah, they got the funnel configuration shot to hell, the underwater model as it surfaces looks much like the little rubber boat I used to play with in the bath as a child, and David Selby has the animal magnetism of Osama bin Laden, but I'd like to tell you something. Perhaps because I maintained a fascination with the TITANIC ever since I was a child and dreamed of just how it must have been that night, when watching that absolutely awesome scene in RAISE THE TITANIC as the great ship broke the surface I have never in my life been so emotionally moved. Tears just ran down my face and I cried like a child. When I got home that night my wife asked me what was wrong. I couldn't talk about it and was never able to explain, and you people reading this want to believe it, I am the absolute last guy you would consider to be a wuss! How anyone could have  witnessed that scene in the theater and NOT been moved I could never understand.So many memorable things in the film. Titanic survivor, Sir Alec Guinness' touching cameo in the pub when he gives Dirk Pitt (the late Richard Jordan) the white star flag that he removed from the stern the night the great ship foundered, and which he wanted replaced if they were ever to raise it from the bottom of the Atlantic. The inarguably realistic scene when Jordan and his crew members finally discover the wreck on the bottom, played out against John Barry's ultimately moving musical score, the best he wrote for ANY film. The external shots of the ship once it has been raised (Way better I thought than Cameron's digitised TITANIC) and the internal shots of the gymnasium still dripping with water. Finally, the wonderful scenes as it is towed into New York harbor to complete its (then) 68-year journey. True, the last twenty minutes or so were all downhill, but nothing can detract from what went before.Worst thing they ever did was to FIND the wreck!

A few years back, Wolf Creek revived Aussie movies and really set the benchmark, however as true form showed, movies to follow it never really reached the levels that could sell internationally. That is until These Final Hours came along. WOW! What an experience! One that I was totally not expecting and found myself caught off guard.Nathan Phillips plays a very arrogant and self indulgent young man, traveling to a party to see in the end of the world which is approaching in 12 hours time. Things are complicated when he saves a young girl from two thugs and learns that she is trying to find her family. With no other option, he takes the girl on a trip, trying to steer clear of trouble, but in a world that is facing certain doom, trouble is very easy to find.If there were any doubts about the ability of Nathan Phillips as an actor, then I think those doubts will be squashed after his performance in this movie. Such a raw portrayal of a horrible situation bringing out the best in a seemingly horrible person. The performance of the young girl was also admirable and I am sure we can expect bigger and better things from her in the future.The violence and sex is there but never overdone. Instead it focuses on how people act in a dire situation. Some good, and some crumble! Some truly heart wrenching scenes that will immediately be compared to the American film ""The Road"" which I was also a big fan of.HOWEVER, I am going out on a limb here and saying that THESE FINAL HOURS is indeed a better film than the brilliant THE ROAD.Go and see it !!!

John Woo became the Crown Colony's hottest director through his kinetic crime flicks that filtered the lyrical violence of Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah, and Walter Hill through an Asian sensibility and re-exported it to the States where Quentin Tarantino became a major admirer.  Woo's trademarks are the stand-off, where two or more gunmen hold each other at bay, and the ferocious gunfight in which dozens of people are killed and restaurants blown apart as the hero pirouettes and somersaults while blasting away with two automatic pistols to throbbing, synthesized Western music.  ""A Better Tomorrow"" is a characteristic fable of male friendship, stoicism, courage, and men living by a personal code, in which women are marginalized.  It made an overnight star of Chow Yun Fat, who appeared in most of Woo's pictures.

This one has to rank at the top of John Wayne's films.Wayne and fellow outlaws Pedro Armendariz and Harry Carey, Jr. arrive at the town of Welcome, Arizona and after a brief chance meeting with the marshal, Ward Bond, proceed to rob the Welcome bank.In pursuit of the robbers, Bond shoots the waterbag draped across Wayne's saddle. And then he cleverly stations men at the few sources of water. Nevertheless the three outlaws decide to chance it across the desert.Life takes a peculiar turn for them as they come across a dying Mildred Natwick who has just delivered an infant. Before she goes she exacts a promise from them to rescue her baby.Even though their own freedom is at stake, Wayne, Armendariz, and Carey subordinate it to the care and rescue of the infant. At this point the Christmas parable takes over. The three wise men setting out with the infant in their charge to the nearest town which happens to be New Jerusalem, Arizona.I said on another review of a Wayne film that John Wayne had one of the greatest faces for movie closeups ever. Check some of them here, especially during the desert trek. They say more than 10 pages of dialog. Ford, Hawks, Wellman all the great directors who worked with the Duke knew that and took advantage. Pedro Armendariz and John Ford came to blow up on the set of 3 Godfathers according to Harry Carey, Jr.'s memoirs. Armendariz almost walked off the film. He finished it though and was great as the fatalistic Mexican outlaw. But he never worked for Ford again.Although he'd done a few films before this, John Ford had in the credits, introducing Harry Carey, Jr. Of course the film is dedicated to his father who in fact had starred in the original silent Three Godfathers. Maybe this should have really been his debut film, Dobe Carey is just fine as the callow youth, The Abilene Kid.This also marked the last film of veteran actor Guy Kibbee. As the practical and perceptive judge who tries Wayne, Kibbee is given a fitting swan song to a great career as a player.This is certainly a more religious work than John Wayne is used to doing. Wayne, although he was baptized Catholic at the end of his life was not a particularly religious man. I do wonder if he had lived another decade what he would have made of the religious right. Ford of course got in his obligatory Shall We Gather At the River, but also Bringing in the Sheaves was sung. And in the scene where a dehydrated John Wayne arrives at a saloon in New Jerusalem, the piano player is first playing The Holy City and then Silent Night. All to great effect by the way.I think people that are not necessarily fans of the Duke will be amazed at the heights he rose to as a player in 3 Godfathers.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNmMzE5MzEtZmM3YS00ODljLWI1YTEtMWU1MmMyZGNiODg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It certainly is no Hollywood blockbuster, but clearly a well made low budget film that used its budget wisely. The directing was great - especially the camera shots and angles. The cinematography was perfect for the landscape. Even the score was surprisingly great for a B-grade film. The 89 min length was perfect as was the pace. The writing was good, as the tension was constant throughout the story, but I would liked to have seen a bit more 'pow' in certain scenes - maybe more of the creative Home Alone antics.Nevertheless, novice director/writer Michael Peterson who's resume is mostly short films and documentaries did an outstanding job with this film. Aside from well known actor Michael Ironside, the rest of the cast are pretty much C-listers as I've never heard of them. All performed quite well, with the exception of Chenier Hundal as the dad who I felt was too bland and seemed as if this was his first acting role.Otherwise a very good film that I do recommend.

There is wonderful depth and splendor in these machinations. There is a lovely poem about creatures with wings, and the spectacular feeling that sweeps over you when the window is opened and they choose to stay instead of flying away. A main theme of the film, that art, acting and stories - like ghosts - lead us to important truths, is very compelling, yet I wish the links and transitions were clearer in this respect. Natalie Portman's performance is exquisite. She manages emotional ambiguities, such as between hope and bitterness, so well. She delves into the playful sexuality that I loved so much in Black Swan. I wish there were longer and more frequent dream sequences.

But then, even beyond that, there are some actors who're just BORN to play certain role!! And that's the theory could be stated by Vincent Price in the Abominable Dr. Phibes. It's impossible to imagine this mad murderer being played by anyone else. Price IS Dr. Phibes and he makes the most of his role here. A truly powerful and fascinating performance that yet has to find its equal. Even if you're not into horror, I would recommend The Abominable Dr. Phibes if it were only for Price...it really is an acting job every self-respected fan of cinema should acknowledge. But The Abominable Dr. Phibes is much more than just a 'tour-de-force' by Price. It stands as one of the most entertaining and original horror movies ever made. It's an innovating movie in every way you look at it and - like none other - it passed the test of time. The film is over 30 years now and it still looks refreshing and extremely cool. To me personally, the single title also sums up several reasons to proof that horror is the most powerful genre in cinema. First and foremost, it brings together two types of cinema that are hard to amalgamate. Face it, the basic plot of Dr. Phibes is a love-story and a tale about how to deal with the loss of a loved one...Much more than a ravenous psychopath, Dr. Phibes is a hurt romanticist! Secondly - and most teachers will deny this - Dr. Phibes is an educational film!! I guess we've all learned about the Biblical Plagues that overcame the Pharaoh in school, but it'll be much more easy to number and memorize them after you've seen this film. You might even say The Abominable Dr. Phibes is a valuable history lesson. And finally, this movie really proofs to me that horror is the ""underdog""-genre in cinema. Do you remember how the plot of Se7en impressed the whole world when it came out in 1995? Both critics and audiences called it innovating, dared and highly original...but were the true horror fans impressed as much? I don't think so because the basic principles the killer in Se7en uses are just a pale tribute to the methods Dr. Anton Phibes employed. Anyway...I start to sound way too dedicated in my love towards the genre. Basically, what I mean is: The Abominable Dr. Phibes is a perfect horror film and perhaps even one of the most entertaining cinema experiences you'll ever have. Especially when it's your first viewing, Dr. Phibes will be a satisfying purchase. It's a refreshing horror film with adorable British humor and solid acting and directing. The whole thing is just a chain of brilliant sequences. Almost impossible to determinate a few highlights...the entire movie is one HUGE highlight!!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWIwYjc5ZjEtZGI0Mi00ODVjLWFhODAtOWU3N2Q5NmNlZDFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Carl Davis was there in person to conduct the London Philharmonic Orchestra in a live performance of his own brilliant score. It was the most moving and overwhelming cinematic experience of my life and I doubt whether it can ever be bettered. The film is decades ahead of its time, the bravura editing and inspired direction reveal Gance as the true genius that he was.However...The very performance I attended was under legal threats from Coppola, who wished to ban its screening. Back in 1980-81, he and his Zoetrope Studio helped fund a restoration and he got his father to compose a score. He helped get the US audiences to recognise what a remarkable work of genius Napoleon really is, and all credit to him for trying to do so. This would all seem very well and good, but even in 1981 Coppola wasn't showing the best version of the restored film that he could have. He had cut it down from Brownlow's (then) latest version to fit the score his father had written. He also showed it at 24 fps instead of the intended (and more realistic - the movements are at a normal rate, not unnaturally sped-up) 20 fps. Throughout the 1980s, Brownlow and others in Europe kept finding better elements and more footage. Yet, Coppola's version was still being called ""THE restoration"" and not altered at all. Brownlow also found prints with more authentic editing, giving a much better idea of the order and number of cuts in many sequences (so many versions/reels of Napoleon have had inferior takes/editing put in by people other than Gance that it took time to discover the best and most authentic). It was becoming increasingly clear that Coppola's version was very much flawed and out-of-date with the new discoveries. In 2000, the latest and most complete version available (including the authentic tints, near-definitive editing in line with Gance's intentions, and the best print so far etc.) was screened in London. Carl Davis had altered and lengthened his magnificent score to match the latest version. Even after this showing in 2000, elements were still being improved to make the film as close as possible to Gance's intentions. The 2004 screening which I attended had a print that ran for nearly 5 and a half hours. Coppola's version runs for less than 4 hours and it hasn't been touched to include any improvements in print quality or more authentic tinting or editing.The Coppola version of Napoleon, with a run time of 223 minutes (3 hours and 43 minutes) is out on DVD in Australia. I do not know when or even if it will come out on DVD in the US. Rest assured, it will NOT be the best version of this great film, or anything close to it. Coppola and Zoetrope sold rights to their version of the film to Universal in the 1980s and so now the issue of rights has become entangled with a major studio (Universal Studios, incidentally, destroyed all their silent film negatives in 1947 - a very (in)appropriate choice of distributor for a film whose failure and subsequent neglect was mainly due to a horrendous re-editing by studios (MGM) in 1927).The Australian DVD, released by Universal, is filled with faults. Apart from inferior image quality (unlike the 2004 print, which was superb and scarcely a speck of dirt was visible any time during the whole 5 and a half hours), the final triptych sequence is horrendously cropped from 3.99:1 to 2.55:1 and isn't even adjusted for widescreen televisions. It's also exactly the same version from 1981 which, even back then, wasn't the best there was available. The music, admirable though it is, cannot compare to Davis' score (he has worked on many other silent film scores with great acclaim) - especially now that Davis has reworked the score for the latest version.Coppola's efforts to suppress the latest restoration are a dreadful example of precisely the kind of money-driven censorship and selfishness that Napoleon has been dogged by for eighty years. Not just the 90+ minutes of extra footage, but the score and print quality itself, makes the latest print by the BFI/BFA/Brownlow indispensable. Anyone who claims to have rescued this film (as Coppola did in 1981, even though Brownlow had been working for decades before then, alongside Gance himself, to remaster the film) and yet tries to ban a closer version to the original film is monstrously hypocritical. As much as I welcome any hope of seeing Napoleon on DVD, I recoil at the thought of thousands of people being forced to watch a terribly flawed and inferior version of this masterpiece. Even as I type, there are rumours of even more lost footage from Napoleon being found in Denmark - with any luck this will lead to an even better restoration than the 2004 one.This ongoing saga of restoration (and much credit is due to the person who seems to have the least legal rights out of the whole cast of those involved in the restored film: Kevin Brownlow) means that a DVD release of the Coppola version, with its many flaws, seems absurd and remarkably selfish and damaging. This film desperately needs to be released on DVD, but only in as close a form as possible to Gance's original masterpiece of 1927, seen by far too few people. That US rights-holders are trying to ban better versions with over 90 minutes extra in them is just another sad chapter in the story of this much-abused wonder of cinema. This is a magnificent film and deserves better than the shoddy and selfish treatment it has been given in America.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI4MDEzNTktMGU4ZC00YjFiLTg4OWEtNzNkMWVlY2YwOTdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjEwMTA0NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The performance even of the stellar Jerzy Stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad - he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like ""I am in the elevator with a nude chick and I haven't done anything to her!"".

Little does she know that she is affecting the lives of others just as much as she is her own.","87","A Nutshell Review: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time","The poster of this animated movie looks a little suggestive, but nope, it's actually a wholesome time travel movie which explores a little on the vestment of such powers to a klutzy individual, as well as relationships, and the perennial question of what would anyone do if you have the ability to go back into time, and make changes presumably for the better.The Girl Who Leapt Through Time tells a wonderful story centered on 3 friends, the tomboyish and clumsy Makoto Konono (voiced by Riisa Naka), and two hunks Chiaki Mamiya (Takuya Ishida) and Kousuke Tsuda (Mitsutaka Itakura). Theirs is a friendship formed after school at the baseball court where they spend quality time talking about typical teenage stuff. Things start to change however, when Makoto by accident gets the power to time travel, and in her own ditzy way, uses her new found abilities for ""good"" - directly for herself, or in some Emma like moments, to influence the outcome of relationships for her friends and play matchmaker.And that's just scratching the tip of the iceberg. While it's animation style is kept simple and fairly straightforward, it doesn't compromise on the complexity of its storyline. Not that it serves to confuse, rather you'll be amazed by the amount of pathos the story contains, with its various subplots especially when the time travelling stuff kicks in. It has adult sensibilities in the treatment of the plot, and knows exactly when to hit the right emotional chords when warranted.Although based on a book, the story here serves as a quasi-sequel of sorts which takes place some 20 years later, what I can say is that the love stories intertwined has its major one being able to touch like that in Be With You. I loved that movie, and watching how this bore some similarities, you can't help but feel the same emotions coming across in the same way, nevermind that the characters here are animated, as you can feel the pain, the love, and their despair. And that is something that I should say is difficult for the genre - they're not real persons on screen - but yet being able to evoke emotions and for one to react and empathize, definitely makes it powerful, and a cut above others. Something that our local animated films had failed to do in giving us cold characters and bastardized stories from folklore.But it's not always all the time serious in tone or mood. The movie has light hearted moments, sometimes bordering on the slapstick, no thanks to the bumbling Makoto character. In a sequence, it was reminiscent of Chinese Odyssey starring Stephen Chow, where each time travel moment gets played ad nausem with different comedic effect. Undoing blunders as we see is not exactly Makoto's forte, and while she may be using her powers in a carefree way, with great powers come great responsibilities (sorry, can't resist that one!)As usual, anyone can find fault with the time travel paradox which rears its ugly head in any time travel movie, but I would suggest that you park those thoughts aside, and enjoy the story that the Girl Who Leapt Through Time is telling. There are slight attempts at addressing it with its creation of totally new and different realities with each jump, but even then a major paradoxical flaw still exists. At its lowest denominator, the film reminds to seize the day like it's your last, do what's right, and don't be shy in telling someone how you feel about them.The Best Animated Film of the recent Awards of the Japanese Academy, this film gets my vote of support too with its superbly emotional and touching tale, and with its similarities to that aspect of the film which I like to Be With You, it will be no surprise if this movie finds its way to my Top Ten of the year.

While I haven't seen many of Reeve's work, I found Reeve's to be a interesting person and this documentary does a good job on exploring his journey before and after his accident with good atmosphere, conversations from other celebrities and exploration about his activist works.The documentary presents good presentation, structure and some informative insights about Reeve's personal life that I didn't know about it and it was pretty emotional to observe. Seeing his family and others discussing of what makes him so special was pretty touching and I felt connected to Reeve's activist work, his journey and the person he is.Without being said, the documentary does have it's faults which are some of the pacing that could be improved. Including the musical tracks feeling repetitive. The musical tracks feel out of place and just like Val and Still: A Michael J.

Thankfully they diminished as the film progressed.Camilla Belle's as Rose performance was surprisingly nuanced and rich for such a young actress, she didn't have one false note and was totally believable as this ""feral,"" innocent, yet disturbed teen. All the supporting actors were excellent, the characterizations and dialogue engaging and true and the emotional unraveling harrowing.Day-Lewis' performance as Jack Slavin was outstanding. It hits you with such power that it left me flattened. While the credits ran I had to close my gaping jaw, peel myself off the movie chair and stumble up the aisle trying to absorb it all.

Its characters are fleshed out human beings capable of good and evil and in the grips of intense suffering, not the formulaic cardboard creations which populate so many recent Hollywood productions. The movie's atmosphere and mood are thick and the bleakness of the New Hampshire winter comes alongside its beauty and majesty. Paul Schrader achieves here what has eluded the Coen brothers in Fargo. The photography of Paul Sarossy is of a rare beauty and his compositions are breathtaking. Think of the scene of the two brothers in the barn lit by light sneaking in through the slits in the wood exterior, the beauty of the snow covered New Hampshire chalets, the camera receding from the barn fire until we get to watch it through a slightly off-center picture-window from the main house, and finally think of the snow in its serenity, its menace, its domination. The two stories are so naturally intertwined that one can spend most of the time convinced one is watching a thriller, until in the end this thriller dissolves into the main story which explores the violent undercurrents of human love and bonding.

What strikes me about Bardot's powerful sexuality is that cinema really hadn't seen anything like it before she came around.  The closest example I can think of in American film might be Lauren Bacall in ""To Have and Have Not,"" but even that misses the mark. Bardot was not only a beautiful woman but she had a fun, mischievous and freedom-loving spirit and a fiery mind lurking around behind her sometimes poorly written characters, and these things make her even more attractive. Plus, she had a great voice.  Which is why I was stunned to see a trailer for _Et Dieu... crÃÂ©a la femme_ dubbed into English at the end of the subtitled version.  The woman doing Bardot's voice sounded awful, and so much of Brigitte's sexuality was lost. Imagine Bacall telling Bogie ""You know how to whistle, don't you Steve?"" in a squeaky, high-pitched voice. Would she be as sexy?  I don't think so.  Yet people watching the dubbed version of this film are getting something similar.  As far as the film itself goes, most everything has already been said in other comments.  Bardot does a great job as Juliette - who else could have done the role so well? - and Jurgens was quite good as Eric Carradine.  The setting is luscious and fits perfectly with Bardot's character and the overall mood of the tale.  The music is excellent, from the title sequence at the beginning through the dance scene at the end.  The story can be cliched at times and there are definitely machista elements.  But it's not a bad story either, with good tension created between the brothers.  The fight sequences, as someone else mentioned, are laughable and poorly done.  But it doesn't really matter.  It's Bardot's show all the way - from her nude Cinemascope sunbathing shot that opens the film, with the witty dialog between her and Jurgens, to her erotic dance that serves as the climax of the story.  Along the way we get several nice scenes that show her broader persona, including the one where she sets the bird and rabbit free in the field, and the scene in the bookstore with the woman from the orphanage.  But, for the sake of Dieu, don't see this movie dubbed.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg1NzgzNDUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgwODgxNDE@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It has been a tradition in the western culture that wishing for a favor when watching the falling stars in the sky is a way to ask for love, riches and luck. The sky watchers can expect a spectacle like no other because of the way those distant lights are seen falling, fast and furious.The brothers Taviani, Paolo and Vittorio, have always come out with interesting films that involve simple people, usually connected to the land. In ""La Notte di San Lorenzo"", the Tavianis take the viewer to witness a group of people from Tuscany during the last days of WWII. The story is told by a 6 years old girl who was too young to realize the horrors around her in those final days of the conflict.In spite of the approaching American liberating army, there are still the horrible local Fascists, who knowing they were fighting a losing battle, terrorized their neighbors into submission. These misguided people, having mined most of the houses in the town, are feared by the local population. Some flee into the countryside, but some remain in the town, convinced that being in the big church will protect them against evil.Things go from bad to worse. We see different vignettes involving some of the people, as they cope with the situation. There is Galvano, who has loved Concetta in silence and is finally, as in a miracle, gets his wish granted in the way that she acknowledges that she has always love him, even after both have been married to different people. There's the young pregnant young bride, who is expecting and who gets married at the beginning of the film, only to be separated from her husband in an ironic twist.The Tavianis painted a huge canvas in which they situated the action. Tuscany in the summer is a lovely place to be, but one can't even comprehend that it was also the scene for the tragedy lived in Italy in those tragic years. The music by Nicola Piovani is effective in the background. Franco DiGiacomo's photography does wonders to make the film a great experience. The large cast does an excellent job for the Tavianis, who are ultimately, the ones to thank for their courage in presenting us this lyrical movie of beauty and death.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGUyYjhlZjQtMjc3ZC00Nzc3LTg1NWEtMDVlMjY0ZTk3MGI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

They rip off older men, feast in lavish meals and do all kinds of mischief. But what is all this leading to?","54","A rare female voice from the Czech New Wave.","The opening of 'Daisies' features a montage of two subjects very familiar to 1966 Eastern Bloc film audiences: work and war, as shots of an industrial machine alternate with views of rubbling city from an airplane bomber's point of view.  These are masculine subjects in a very masculine culture. Or they seem to be.  The machine features a circular mechanism, and represents repetition, but also productivity, and might be said to represent female principles, whereas the war footage is of pure destruction.  The heroines of 'Daisies' embody both these gender-specific realms, and manage to create something new.  They are idle, but, like George Costanza, their indolence depends on relentless invention.  They are destructive, but out of the destruction they produce something new.  'Daisies' was a product of the Czech New Wave, but seems a million miles away from its most famous contemporaries, the films of Menzel and Forman. These latter, though liberal and anti-totalitarian, were artistically conservative - deliberately humanist works, where 'real', psychologically plausible characters exist in 'real' places, and every narrative progression makes logical sense.  If they seem 'timeless' to us now, it is because they didn't truly engage with their own times.And, of course, they were male.  Where they seem closer to the 19th century novel, or classic Hollywood cinema, Chytilova's peers are the great European modernists, Godard, Paradjanov, Makajev, Rivette, or the plays of Ionesco. Where Forman and Menzel framed their illusions of realism in formal coherence, Chytilova revels in formal instability. These aren't psychologically plausible characters in a cause-and-effect universe.  We first meet the two Maries after the opening credits, and their automaton gestures, with accompanying sound effects, continue the movement of the machine.  The plot basically consists of the girls trying to chat up old men who'll feed them, but what they really do is make a nonsense of plot.  The recurring motif is the posy of roses worn by Marie II, and thrown by her to further the story - we remember the nursery rhyme 'a ring a ring of rosies, a pocketful of posies, a tishoo, a tishoo, we all fall down'.  And everything falls down here, in a game where the rules have splintered and fragmented.  The film mixes monochrome, colour, and unstably tinted scenes.  Sequences that begin 'sensibly' are broken down, by slapstick, changes of register, 'impossible' changes of location or physics, or are turned from natural scenes into the robotic movements of a clockwork toy going out of control. This disruption has a theoretical point - in one scene, the girls find their bodies cut up as they find their identities dissolved by conflicting desires, social expectations and representations.  In another, they wander around a dream space, wondering why people pay no attention to them, realising that 'logically', they mustn't exist, because Western culture has no place for them.  Just as they parody the notions of work and war (in the climactic food orgy, martial army music soundtracks a cake fight), so these sprites play with and destroy the assumptions of Western humanism, its claims to adequately represent 'reality', especially in a time of such bewildering, radical change, as in the 1960s.  They do to cinema what Ionesco did to literature, cut it into shreds.  The whole thing plays like parody Godard, with Marie II as Anna Karina, with meaningful conversations about love accompanied by the girls cutting up sausages and bananas: the butterfly sequence is a wicked lampoon of 'Vivre sa Vie'.  Where Godard's heroines remained fixed and stared at, the two Maries laugh, look, escape, see their frame and break it, insist on their body as something more than an object, something they can play with themselves.  Not even the heroines' liberating subversivess is fixed - their mindless appetite is punished as often as their formal iconoclasm is celebrated.  But for all its theoretical rigour, 'Daisies' never sacrifices its sense of humour - I first saw it when I was ten, and loved it for its slapstick fun, its narrative unpredictability, its playful soundtrack, and its tireless visual invention.  I still love it now.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGVkNWNmYjktZmI4ZC00OWVhLWIwMDQtNTc3MTBhNzRmNjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTExMTE3NDg5._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He then blows up Chuck Norris's house and frightens Chuck's pet baby armadillo. Big mistake, Rostov. BIG FRIGGIN' MISTAKE!From the title you can only manage to expect an overblown macho action-fest and that is precisely what this is. Schwarzenegger had 'Commando' also in 1985 and Stallone came out with a similar vehicle in 'Cobra' the next year. The idea of one guy taking out hordes of bad guys with his trusty weapon of choice - a pair of uzis with unlimited ammo in this case - is here much like in the aforementioned films.Interesting is the not-so-subtle presentation of uber-patriotism. Chuck Norris wears all blue, drives American cars, lives in the American wetlands of Florida and so on. While the badguys speak with their ridiculous foreign accents, use much different and presumably foreign weapons and even drive non-American cars even if they acquire them in America. Was this intentional? Well that doesn't matter actually, because it is played out to no effect.What does matter is the film's absurdity. The film begins with a laughably goofy set-up for a political thriller and ends up being a series of loosely connected action scenes with Chuck making his heroic appearance and taking out the badguys with the very bomb they intended to plant. One scene where Chuck saves a school bus will literally have you laughing on the floor for how stupid it is. If you think you have seen ""so bad it's funny"" then see this film - it is so bad it's... um... very funny!The only real highlights (things that are actually good for real) are Richard Lynch's turn as the villain. It is a delightfully stereotypical villain role, but it was sadly underused. Ah-nuld's 'Commando' made much better use of it's goofy villains, premise, and overall feel making it an equally stupid, but much more satisfying film in the end. The other thing is the premise at hand here - an attack on America. Uber-patriotic crap aside, that could make for a good and interesting thriller. What the film makers here didn't realize that that idea (as with any worthy thriller) is going to take more than 5 minutes to develop into a screenplay.Also of note would have to be the film's gun-play. In most action movies people don't aim when shooting, but they at least try to look it and essentially most decent action films get away with that. Here, not only do people don't aim, they don't even look like their trying. There is actually a scene where the badguys storm into a building (that's empty) and just shoot everything. Maybe they thought they were in the AOL customer service office.

I, myself, was kind of a ragamuffin misfit kid from a broken home who spent weekends with my dad's new blended family. I felt the siblings' pain at being torn from their home. Tia broke my heart. She was as fragile as me, but far stronger when it really counted. Tony was just hot! Older and very cute at 13. And those powers they had? How cool was that? By the time the credits rolled, I knew I'd seen the best movie ever!I was lucky enough to have an older cousin who loved movies and hanging out with me and she bought the Disney movie record for me. I don't know if any of you remember these; Disney used to release LPs of the audio track of some of their movies, usually truncated and featuring narration. In the case of ""Escape"", it was narrated by Eddie Albert. This thing enabled me to memorize every line of Tony and Tia's dialog and much of that of the other characters, too. I still have it, though the sleeve is long lost. It's tough for me to watch the movie without speaking along with the characters (especially Tia), at least in my head.My cousin also bought me Alexander Key's book. Boy, Disney sure took liberties, didn't they? Key's book is far more serious and developed and meaningful. I tried to take the best parts from the book and the movie and incorporate them together into the Tony and Tia of my imagination. It deepened them. Too bad there was no fanatic outlet back in those days! It was pretty egolesss of Alexander Key for coming together with Disney on the eventual novelization of ""Return"". Without Key's kind participation, it would of been an empty exercise. I was especially impressed with how he incorporated the issue of Tia needing to learn to speak.Through the years, I never ""Escape"" and I saw it as often as I could. For instance, when ""Return"" was released, Disney sent the movies out as a double feature. I loved ""Return"", silly as it was, even though there were things in it that really bugged me. Like the sibs being split apart for most of the movie. I loved them together! I think most of the fans of the first film were most affected by their chemistry. I think we wanted to see more of that. Even so, I really liked the Earthquakes, all of them. And it was fun to see Kim and Ike a bit older and even cuter than before. I also remember seeing ""Escape"" on an odd revival double-bill with ""Bambi"" at some point in my teen years. I think I would've followed Kim and Ike anywhere. Heck, I even followed them to ""Devil Dog, The Hound Of Hell"". You have to see the comments page here at IMDb if you haven't already.I would've seen ""Tuff Turf"" even if Kim wasn't in it, but that's a convoluted story for another thread. Suffice to say I have seen TT far too many times and many of them were for Kim. Also, I can honestly say I enjoy the TV edit of ""Star Trek II"" far more than the theatrical cut because it has more Ike. I even had a good time watching ""Blair Witch Mountain..."" when it hit the web. I have to agree that it might be fun to revisit Tony and Tia with the original actors today. Hey, last year, the new ""Twilight Zone"" brought Anthony (Billy Mumy) back and introduced us to his similarly gifted, but far less scary (real life) daughter (Liliana Mumy). And all those people came back from the cornfield. Why not Tony & Tia?I could rhapsodize for paragraphs about both ""With Mountain"" films, and I may still do so when I get my special edition DVDs. In the meantime, here's hoping that a whole new generation of kids will discover ""Witch Mountain"" for themselves.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzZjODA5NjctMGZlNC00YjNlLTg2NDQtNDE1YTc3YTMxYzBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwODg2MDY@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Sure, ""Surf Ninjas"" is targeted at the teenage crowd, but you don't have to be a teenager to enjoy it.  Even now, as an adult, I still enjoy this film.  Although, it's a bit difficult pinpointing why exactly I like it so much, but one of the main reasons was because the main characters were so engaging and enjoyable.  The most enjoyable characters are Johnny and Iggy, but just about everyone turns out an enjoyable performance here.  One of my favourite scenes in this film is when the cast gives a hilarious rendition of the song, ""Barbara Ann"", right after Johnny liberates his people.  Also, there are some wonderful jokes in this film, many of which are very witty.  But I won't give any of them away; they're far too funny to spoil.  I guess this is the type of film you could call a ""guilty pleasure"", but I don't really see why.  Why anyone would categorize something such as this that's funnier than 90% of the American comedies out there as ""guilty"" is beyond me.My rating: 9 stars out of 10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA2NjUyOTYtODEyMy00OTE1LWFhOWYtZDhhNWU1MWYwMjA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's (as expected) full to the brim with intriguing thought concepts and ideas, all resulting in different outcomes in visually stunning locations and scenarios. I myself was lucky enough to have been given a similar experiment back when I was in secondary school and was already familiar with the game being played in the movie.It's important to note this film isn't a documentary or project done for showing in schools and colleges though- it's a film. I think where the reception for the movie went awry was where many were expecting it to all make perfect sense and in the end make you realise something you never did before- not so. Instead what this film does is take a very well-known philosophical debate whereby a group must decide between them who shall be fit to continue the human race in special circumstances, but applies it to a younger generation of adults today and how a group of us may think differently to that of a group asked the same thing, say, 50 years ago. It's more importantly a film about morality, logics, and how we as people judge what is and isn't important, and encourages you to see the importance of those we would cast aside as weak.Personally I loved the film, it has a great cast of actors, it's visually stunning and not too heavy or mystifying. I recommend seeing it before going on what the others have said.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyNjY4MjM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQyNzE4MDE@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I listed Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors. I don't know if this is always true, but for the most part I feel fairly confident regarding my choice. Allen's story here works, like most well written literature, on many levels. It is funny (Woody's lessons), symbolic (the Rabbi going blind), ironic (the good suffer and the evil go unpunished), deep (faith and suicide), and is a film that leaves you with something to identify with and learn from. Even Hally Reed's (Mia Farrow) surprising revelation at the end of the film, which I won't reveal of course, shows us a bit about the dangers of prejudging others. Woody shows us that we shouldn't judge on the surface, but must look deeper into the individual value of people. Do we trust Hally, or do we stick to what we see as the truth about Lester (Alan Alda)? This is a lesson that Woody's character, Cliff, doesn't even fully grasp at the end of the film, but Allen gives us the insight, even though what Hally reveals about Lester goes against what we've seen of him.Crimes and Misdemeanors is certainly not for all tastes. It's not exactly a film that people would watch for pure escapism. This is a film to be treasured, revisited and held up with some of the greatest films of all time. Not for how it looks or sounds, but for what it says.

What's more perplexing is having seen 'The Bridge At Remagen,' you may think it more or less happened that way which was intriguing to say the least.*** SPOILERS ***In reality, the events surrounding the capture of this bridge were even more bizarre and surely never was there such great coincidence. These elements of the movie happened in reality:-the bridge at Remagen was accidentally captured intact by US forces;-the Germans unsuccessfully tried to blow it up, repeatedly;-the Americans lost a lot of men in the fighting around the bridges;-the German commander of the defense at the bridge was court martialed and executed by the Germans;Following are the more bizarre real events of the bridge at Remagen. The commander of the US re con force that spotted the bridge first, was an man named Karl Timmerman! This US Lieutenant was of German descent. His father had stayed in Europe following his tour of duty during the First World War. There his father met his future mother in Germany. Karl Timmerman was born and grew up in Germany, NEAR the bridge at Remagen. He and his parents then moved to the States.Timmerman and his men took the bridge and the Germans guarding it completely by surprise. No men were lost and the relative small squad quickly disabled the defending machineguns and captured all defenders without firing a single shot! US high command didn't think the bridge at Remagen of strategic importance as there were no major roads leading from it. However, remembering his youth nearby, Timmerman explained and persuaded his commanders because he knew from memory that a dozen kilometers nearby, was the major highway to Frankfurt!Although it had cost them not a single man to capture the bridge, the Americans lost a LOT of men in the days and weeks following the capture, because the Germans were desperate to recapture it. They made many attacks and bombed the bridge from the air, even with the first jet-bombers.The movie was really okay, much much better than 'Battle Of The Bulge' or even 'The Battle Of Britain.'","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFhYmZiMDAtNmVjOS00NmZlLWFiMjctMmVmN2M1YjQ2NzA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Yes, the book is a brilliant work in its own right, and open to interpretation, as a truly complex work must be.  The movie is not the book.  It is Hill's interpretation of the book, and a brilliant and viable one it is.  Hill won the best Director Oscar the next year with ""The Sting"".  He later filmed the similarly unfilmable ""World According To Garp"" and also did a brilliant job with it, partially by letting go of John Irving's more depressing side.  Other notable credits include Butch Cassidy... and The Great Waldo Pepper.  Michael Sacks, in his first movie, and only starring role at the tender age of 24, is completely convincing and natural.  He is equally effective, compelling, and believable at the six distinct stages of Pilgrim's life memorialized herein.  If he weren't up to the six-in-one role, the film wouldn't work, but he is, and it does.  (I wonder why he has no other major credits, and ceased acting altogether in 1984.  If anyone knows, please e-mail me.)Valerie Perrine is fine as Montana Wildhack.  The other characters are all played for maximum irony and effect, and the cast delivers beautifully, without exception.  Eugene Roche is the epitome of kindness as Edgar Derby, the yin, to Ron Liebman's yang, a twisted ball of anger named Paul Lazaro. John Dehner is brilliant as a war-hawk professor upset at the Vietnam protesters.  His character would be as appropriate amidst today's global conflagration as it was in 1966.  Lucille Benson, Kevin Conway, Sorrell Booke, Holly Near, Richard Schaal, and Perry King are the more familiar names in a uniformly excellent cast, including the German actors.The musical score is also perfect, both in tone and substance.  Vonnegut is a master of superimposing satire over irony over futility.  The movie does a marvelous job of blending these contrasts and making its audience feel enriched.  The music underscores all of these contrasts.  The cinematography also is magnificent.Searching desperately for something to say to show that the movie cannot be 100% perfect, the only thing I can come up with is that the pacing of the movie drags slightly when the soldiers leave the first camp for Dresdner until their new Kommandant gives his ""welcoming"" speech.  It might have played better with about three minutes cut from that sequence.  So what?I recently saw Slaughterhouse Five for the fifth time in 27 years since I originally saw it at my college campus -- this time on DVD.  I never fail to catch something new, and I never fail to enjoy it all the more.Given how many 70's movies have failed miserably to withstand the test of time, Slaughterhouse Five is a true treat to be savored.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQzZGUzNzQtMGQyOC00Nzg0LWEyZWQtN2QwOWU5Yjk5YTExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Birkin also wrote this superb adaptation of Ian McEwan's perverse and haunting novel.

The casting of Andrew Robertson and Charlotte Gainsbourg as the androgynous older siblings is the main reason why this odd movie is so successful. To add to the incestuous overtones, Gainsbourg is Birkin's niece, and first gained notoriety duetting with her legendary father Serge on a pop ditty titled ""Lemon Incest"" while barely in her teens.

Split between two timelines, she gets taken on a violent journey as she seeks out the person responsible for her lover's death.","18","Not exactly the followup film for Isabelle we were expecting... (sigh)","Short Review: This writer wrote a very positive review of American Mary (here on the IMDb) noting that it was not only a superbly produced and directed little indie, but that it finally gave Isabelle room to shine, and she was brilliant in it. The implication was that casting directors would take note and her next film would be a step up .... well, that did not exactly happen....Longer Review: To understand this film you need to understand two things initially: (a) The films made and distributed in the 1970s were a reaction by film-makers to industrial-quality and soul-less films produced in the 60s, possibly the last decade where the big studios from the 1930s still held sway. The films of the 70s -- now almost a ""lost decade"" to reviewers -- deliberately broke all the rules of editing, pacing, cinematography, continuity ... to be different, to make a point. As such, they succeeded, but they still were not especially good films, nor did audiences get much joy from them.(b) what the Canadian and Austalian film industry have in common is that both are creatures of government fiscal policy, not responses to viewer demand. In other words, both were artificially created by bureaucrats. In the case of Canada, the industry lucked out when American producers, fed up with high costs and tough unions, saw a chance to reduce top-line costs by shooting in the North. While the Canadian industry is financially successful, and has spawned some excellent product, it still remains the easiest venue in which to produce knock-offs, bad sequels, and B-movies where the main goal is a successful financing and not necessarily a satisfied audience.SO...With these two concepts firmly in mind, I would opine that Isabelle's much-awaited followup to American Mary is, disappointingly, a weird and vacuous homage to the 70s style of film-making, featuring an incomprehensible plot, erratic direction and editing, and massive stretches with no dialog at all because -- frankly -- that saves even more top-line money for the production. That it was produced in Canada only serves to emphasize how this was at its core a financial exercise, not an artistic one. And to those reviewers who dare suggest that the presence of Christopher Lloyd and Michael Ironside somehow raises this to an A-class production, all I can say PA-LEEZE, the former is at a point in his career where any work is good work; and the latter has of late mainly become a voice actor for animation. (The fact that Ironside himself is Canadian and started his career by making Canadian films in the 70s only adds a new and un-needed sheen of irony to any discussion of ""88"").","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5ODM0NjU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzY4ODA2NTE@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Many a film out there in the realm of anime could have been made as a live-action feature, even though in cases like Akira or Ghost in the Shell, the budget would have been prohibitive.This distinction is particularly interesting to apply to Jin Roh: this could well have been live-action, and since its story, themes and execution put it well outside the Western boundaries for animation we need to ask ourselves why it is not only particularly suited to that medium, but can easily be counted among the finest animated features of all time.Drawing countless parallels with the tale of Little Red Riding Hood - the original, somewhat pessimistic version - Jin Roh explores two characters on an inevitable collision course: a traumatized, counter-terrorist elite soldier and a young, female future suicide-bomber. Given the subject-matter, it is surprisingly apolitical, not siding with either faction or even exploring the roots of terrorism within the context of this story. In fact, to great and horrifying effect, it is more concerned with the mundane nature of it all, and the dehumanizing effect of their roles on the respective characters. This is a world without redemption, where the only choice is between embracing your role, or drifting off into an abyss.Telling this very specific story through animation elevates it into a myth, into a horribly grounded adaptation of that ultimate suspicious authority-rejecting cautionary fairytale. Perhaps there is no grandma or little red riding hood, only wolves in people's clothing. It's hard to imagine a live-action version of Fuse's empty stare that could ever conjure the effect deployed here.Finally, Jin Roh was the last fully hand-drawn Japanese animated feature (1999), and it uses its broad array of technical tool with a mastery and restrain that puts even a Pixar or Studio Gibli to shame. If you want monsters and heroes and magic, go see something else... This is a moving example of how a good story incredibly well told can rip your heart out. A must-see!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGYxMjk3ZWQtZGY5NC00ZDZlLTk5NTAtMTY4OWM1ZjQ4YzJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTgyNTA4MjM@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

But sadly the 5 star or 7.2 star rating provided to this movie may be based on the directors previous works and not the current one! Ram Leela is a good misdirection done by Mr. Sanjay Leela Bansali. Even Houdini would have to bow to him if this movie turns out to be a hit. Having watched many variations of the classic Romeo and Juliet, the last being one with Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes, I can very well say that Ram Leela is clearly not a variant of this. Most likely the reviewer has been primed to think so. With an absolutely no story line, the movie relies on raunchy scenes between Deepika and Ranvir to carry the show. There's mindless violence, ridiculous camera work used for portraying mayhem against women, cheap dialogue's to show coolness. To take your attention off the plot, Mr. Bansali uses these misdirections very well. The eyes see colorful Gujarati Garbha dances, a clear desert, some good architecture around Gujarat, and the mind forgets that the movie has a story to tell! An item song by Priyanka Chopra is also thrown in to save the day. The rating 3 of watchable is mainly to see our Hansaben, Supriya Pathak. Her portrayal of Baa is mind blowing and dialogue delivery is great. Those used to seeing regular Baa's in our TV serials, now get to see a different Baa! Deepika had made a good choice with Chennai Express, where her acting skills were utilized. In Ram Leela she's there to dance and whine! One does not see the boldness Aish portrayed in HDDCS or the damsel deeply in love Aish portrayed in Devdas. I guess Mr Bansali wanted to see a mixture of both in Deepika. But sadly the story line does not call for it! Ranvir still has remnant parts of Band Baaja Baraat and Ladies Vs. Ricky Behl. In most of the scenes either he is full carefree or full sentimental (literally crying). A talent like Richa Chadda is wasted. To conclude, its sad to see Mr Bansali following Ram Gopal Verma's footsteps wherein camera work and raunchy scenes are used as misdirection for a bad storyline","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDljNWM1MzctM2E5NC00YjFkLWI2MDUtNzJkNGIyMGZmN2MwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Instead, the happy duo helps others solve their existential issues, the kind that keep you up at night, wondering what it all means.","358","""How am I not myself?""","One of the biggest influences for the ideas presented in David O. Russell's 'I Heart Huckabees' was 9/11. He is quoted as saying in Film Comment Magazine, 'For about two months after 9/11, people were asking really profound questions about reality and existence-and then it was back to business as usual.' Indeed this seems to be the case whenever bad things seem to happen in life as people search for the reasoning behind the events and for a meaning to their own existence. Disillusionment often takes place for many affected by tragedy, as has happened to the characters in 'I Heart Huckabees.' From an activist fighting urban sprawl to a firefighter blaming the worlds ills on petroleum hungry nations, 'I Heart Huckabees' presents profound questions about existence with a unique comic approach.After seeking the reasoning behind a coincidental meeting, Albert (Jason Schwartzman), an activist/poet, seeks the help of some existential detectives, Bernard and Vivian (Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin). They agree to study his case by spying on his every day activity and getting into his psyche. In an attempt to help Albert seek answers to his profound questions, Bernard and Vivian join Albert with a disillusioned firefighter named Tommy (Mark Whalberg) who seeks answers to the same questions on life. However, Tommy has a strong bias that all the world's problems result from the exploitation of petroleum. During their investigation into Albert's life, Bernard and Vivian realize that Albert's problems often stem from his struggle to fight the Huckabees Corporation from building on the lands Albert tries in vain to protect- particularly with a corporate salesman named Brad (Jude Law). As Bernard and Vivian further investigate, they realize that Brad and his girlfriend Dawn (Naomi Watts), the sexy image behind Huckabees advertising, have a few of their own existential problems to deal with. Especially Dawn who is completely disillusioned by her own beautiful image, as well as Brad's phony persona. Two schools of thought come into play. One, Bernard and Vivian's viewpoint that everything is connected and the world is not a negative place, but chooses not to deal with its problems. On the other hand, Tommy believes in the viewpoints of a French author named Caterine Vauban (Isabell Huppert) who says that the world is simply a mess, pain and anger are present and the only way to deal with it is to just except it. So who is right and who is wrong? The film's message is that neither is truly wrong or right, but the two must meet somewhere in the middle. What's more, perceptions have an important role in this film. Life is often what you make it. A person can be a phony individual and simply jump on the bandwagon of what is popular to seek approval and acceptance. Or, they could ask themselves if they really believe in certain viewpoints and question the right and wrong that exists in our complex, modern world.At first glance, with the film's slapstick, yet witty intellectual dialogue combined with unique visuals, it would seem that this is the product of Charlie Kaufman. But Russell's ideas are undeniably his own and have been pondered upon in his mind for years. The director of the Gulf-War drama/comedy, 'Three Kings,' and 'Flirting with Disaster' has made one of 2004s best films. 'I Heart Huckabees' is filled with three-dimensional characters and crisp-sounding dialogue that will leave you chuckling hours after seeing the film. Most importantly, it has ideas that most Hollywood executives fear to take on because of our very conventional societal viewpoints. ****","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTk5YmEwOTMtZjIzOC00MjFhLWFhN2ItNDgzZDhhYjVjOWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The plot concerns the true story of the life of the young Christopher Robin and the changing relationship he has with his parents in the 1920s.It blends the mental trauma his father has been living with since his WW1 experience, and Christopher Robin's own traumatic childhood, both of witnessing his own parent's fractious relationship and then the deep unhappiness of having his life turned upside down when his fathers book, Winnie the Pooh, becomes an enormous and unexpected worldwide hit and inadvertently makes a celebrity of Christopher Robin.This is a film primarily about family relationships and it is extremely well written too. Will Tilston, who plays Christopher Robin at 8 years old, puts in an exceptionally competent and sweet performance that makes you genuinely feel for the character.He finds the only person who actually understands and shares his anguish is his nanny, Olive (Kelly MacDonald). Olive too notices how unhappy Christopher Robin becomes but her pleas fall on deaf ears.The only real flaw in any of the characterizations is Margot Robbie's turn as Daphne, Christopher Robin's mother. Whilst Domnhall Gleeson's AA Milne at least has some back story to explain why his mentally tortured writer is struggling to shake off his demons and thus oblivious to his son's reluctant celebrity status, Daphne comes across as somebody who is a bit cold and shallow and has no problems with watching her son get exploited to make the book a success. This may of course be what she was really like but the film doesn't dig very deep into her character. However this is a minor quibble in an otherwise well made film.There are moments of humour in the script and no bad language so I expect this film will appeal to older audiences as well as families. The film is also just about the right length too if you like a good old fashioned biopic/drama. There is also a moral at the heart of this tale about the need to let children have a normal childhood, which is very much applicable even now.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjJlODVhNzUtNTk4OC00ZmRjLTg4ZDQtMjc5OWZkY2JlY2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA3MTU2MjE@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Modern action has been overrun by special effects and stuntmen with death wishes (not that I'm complaining), but one must consider the time and the place.  It's not the world of the Matrix or the Human-Cyborg War (or whatever it's called) in the Terminator, it's Hong Kong in the 1980's with counterfeiting, hostile Chinese syndicates.  It doesn't have to be a big budget feature to be great. Clerks by Kevin Smith had a minute budget, but it made Smith famous. I digress.  Woo creates a sensitive and emotionally complex... assassin. To make him reconsider his job as a professional killing machine Jeffrey, the killer, blinds a lounge singer, Jenny.  He swears to himself that he will end his career after one last job.  Woo introduces us to the concept, like you see in A Better Tomorrow, that you can never leave a Triad even if you try your hardest.  With an hour of attempting, Jeff realizes the horrible truth.  Rarely does Woo bring in this feeling of absolute futility in his work.  After losing his best friend, Jeff has crossed the Rubicon in his attempts and must end his ties to it by ending his everyone's but his own, excluding Jenny and Inspector Lee.  Some people dislike the final shootout, but the doves and the Christian symbology adds a touch that drives religious and heroic bloodshed to the minds of the audience.  On a personal note, I love it.  The last few seconds depict a man, perhaps Lee, playing a harmonica in front of the church for reasons I don't know.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjgxOGViYTYtYWRkMC00MGZmLTk0OWEtYTgwZGNiMmZjNzYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

She has two sons--Francis (Jacob Williams/Aaron Pierre) and Michael (David Odion/Sabastian Nigel Singh/Lamar Johnson). Francis is older than Michael by a couple of years and is protective of his family in the father's absence. By his late teens, Francis is a large, physically intimidating man who acts with confidence but has some questionable friends. Michael is smaller, darker, less self-confident, and more studious in school. In high school, Michael is attracted to Aisha (Delia Lisette Chambers/Kiana Madeira), a Canadian-Jamaican neighbor whose father came from the same area of Jamaica as Ruth.The story jumps back and forth between 1981, 1991, when a tragic event occurs, and 2001 when Michael is trying to hold things together. We see the bleakness of many Caribbean immigrant lives, the aura of violence that is never far away, and the problematic relationship with a lily-white 1991 Scarborough police force.""Brother"" is the story of family love persisting through trauma, shattered dreams of a hopeful Jamaican musician, and territorial conflicts between gangs of similar backgrounds, with a final glimmer of resolution at the end. ""Brother"" was a hard movie to watch because of its ring of truth and many dark scenes. The chemistry between Blake, Pierre, and Johnson was excellent. Madeira was also good. My biggest complaint was that I found the rapid jumping back and forth in time sometimes confusing. And I wonder if the metaphor of hydro-tower-climbing interspersed throughout the film really worked. Nonetheless, ""Brother"" is one of the better Canadian movies I've recently seen.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGNkYzk5NzktNGRiZS00OTk5LWE4NmEtNjEyZDc0ZjIwNTY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwMTQ0Njk3._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The non-linear narrative, going back and forth to make multiple reveals elevated the drama even if the reveals were to be predictable.

It's what you'd expect from a heist movie and it certainly doesn't disappoint. The directing is nothing special, it just seems like standard Hollywood movie making with nothing really standing out as being special. The dialogue is nothing flash, its normal dialogue with very little standout lines. The performances are once again nothing stand out, all the actors do a decent job in this movie but nothing worthy of an Oscar.

He wants to marry her one day because marrying her can raise his social position.","315","Thousands Of Films On The World War, But None Was So Irrelevant","Bawaal (2023) : Movie Review -Bawaal Review : Nitesh Tiwari collaborates with Sajid Nadiadwala for the second time with Bawaal, starring Varun Dhawan and Janhvi Kapoor. By far, this has to be Nitesh Tiwari's most irrelevant and non-commercial film ever made. The reason for dropping it on OTT must be appreciated since our masses, or even half of the classes, are unaware of Major World War II chapters. Thanks to our great educational system, which has kept the World War chapters mandatory for us even though our lives are least affected by them. Would European and American education systems make Indian History mandatory in their schools? I highly doubt so. But here we have a filmmaker who decided to use World War II conflicts to arrange his Indian love story with an Indian couple who have nothing to do with it and seem more disturbed by the World War events than the foreigners whose ancestors have actually suffered from them. Logic killed me there.Bawaal is a fancy title for a Hindi movie, and so the lead character has to be fancy anyway. We have Ajju (Varun Dhawan), a history teacher who has been an average guy in every field throughout his life. But he has found a show-off layer to protect himself and has created an image even above what Ambani has in Lucknow. He is married to Nisha (Janhvi Kapoor), a beautiful and intelligent girl with a problem of epilepsy. Ajju's show-off dreams are shattered when he learns about Nisha's disease on the first day of marriage, and he decides to keep distance with her and not take her out to save his ""image"". Ajju's easy-going fake life comes into trouble when he slaps a student, who happens to be the son of an MLA. To save humiliation and create a new ""mahol,"" Ajju takes off to Europe to visit all the important places of World War II events and teach students online with practical knowledge. As expected, Ajju and Nisha come closer during this trip, but is all gonna be well or not?It amazed me that Bawaal is written by four people (Nitesh Tiwari, Piyush Gupta, Nikhil Mehrotra, and Shreyas Jain), and none of them looked into the basic sense of writing the main protagonist. If a person doesn't have knowledge of history, then how did he become a teacher? He was supposed to have a Degree, right? Or was just the talkie-talk enough to get a job? All of a sudden, a student asks his teacher about the gas chamber, when throughout all the previous lessons he knew that they were not studying at all. And how was Ajju supposed to carry on with no knowledge as a history teacher anyway? Before and after.. I can understand if he has fooled the students and chapri guys on the street with his stories of IAS, Army, and what not, but how can a group of well-educated teachers have a discussion over the same topic, who are supposed to have passed B. Ed. Exams? Nisha is a graduate and an independent girl, but right after marriage she is turned into an illiterate housewife. Why? This usually happens in all our daily soaps. In one scene, she says, ""No boy has ever asked me for a date/drink?"" Why, madam? You didn't walk with a board of epilepsy, right? How would any guy know then? You are beautiful, and you are intelligent, but can a secret epilepsy outrun these visible facts for college boys?After this wrong presentation of the lead characters, Bawaal soon flies to Europe. Ajju cannot understand English beyond Hi, hello, how are you, and good morning, and yet he planned to go alone. Geee, man. Soon, we are in the war zone, as the audio clip does more damage than the award-winning history books, movies, and YouTube videos that have portrayed these horrible events over the years. The Ohama beach battle has been seen a few times on screen, including Steven Spielberg's classic ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but how did it affect our Ajju Bhaiya is quite out of my mind. I mean, he must have listened to many stories in his life, be it in school, college, or from his parents; did he see traumatic visualisations like this every time? On a funny note, foreigners walking on the same beach and listening to the same audio clip are less bothered than Indians. The Diary of Anne Frank has come on stage, on the big screen, and on TV multiple times (with George Stevens 1959 version giving it the best treatment, IMO), but it never felt so rough to me as it did in Bawaal. You make us feel that your characters are now deeply affected by Anne Frank's tragedy, but the next moment you have them in sexy clothes and involved in a romantic ballad. Such a terrible line-up of events in the screenplay. I guess people should stop visiting Auschwitz Gas Chambers now since it can lead to mental breakdowns and fits. In one scene, Ajju compares his fake image to that of Hitler, calling out that people don't remember your fake image by looking at a car parking place where Hitler died. This is to tell us that people don't remember Hitler now, but then how the hell do you know that he was buried or died there? Even not having a tomb is a tale in itself. Of course, this is a very intellectual subject to discuss, and I don't think Bawaal should be invited to the round table since it attempts a rough and brief study of WW II for typical Indian audiences, who are not at all interested in knowing the details. Like the headline says, thousands of films have been made on World War in Hollywood, German, French, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, and other foreign language cinemas, but none of them were so irrelevant as Bawaal, and the blame goes to the writers.Bawaal has Varun Dhawan in a heroic role, who later drops all the heavy stuff. Yes, Varun Dhawan is a fine actor, but only in Badlapur and the October zone, where the character graph takes complete control. Not something like Bawaal, which takes him to the Coolie No. 1 zone for half the time and makes him a contrary guy the rest of the time. Yes, Janhvi Kapoor can suit the role, but it has to be in the Dhadak or Mili zone, where she actually looks like the characters she is playing. Watching her play a wife, and such a mild one, is not at all appreciated, while her voice tone needs a lot of cleaning. And where was the chemistry we needed for this so-called romantic drama, which it hardly is? Bawaal hardly gives a chance to supporting actors, even if they are highly talented. Manoj Pahwa and Mukesh Tiwari are known faces, yet they get so little to do, while Anjuman Saxena, Vyas Hemang, Prateek Pachori, Shashie Vermaa, and child artists pass on without any impressive scenes.A big thank you to Mithoon for a melodious ""Tumhe Kitna Pyaar Karte"" that stays with you. Other songs don't. Mitesh Mirchandani's cinematography is okay, and Charu Shree Roy's lacks moments in the second half. Dear Nitesh Tiwari, I almost fought with some of my friends when I called you ""the next big thing in Bollywood after Rajkumar Hirani,"" and they were like, ""Abhi bahut time hai wo level ko Jane ka"". I hope they don't see Bawaal and call me and make fun of me now. I'd rather take that fun on myself if things are going to be better for you in the future. Chillar Party, Bhoothnath Returns, Dangal, and Chhichhore-such a nice filmography-and then comes Bawaal, which is not even close to the weakest film of them all. We expect better from you, Nitesh sir, because you have only set that standard for us. Bawaal had to be that faith-breaking film from Nitesh Tiwari, like Befikre is for Aditya Chopra. The basic plot is just so wrong, I believe. Why would India be affected by World War II when we are not even aware of its impact on our Freedom fight? Take the same story to our history, such as 1857's Battle, Bengal's partition, the Jalianwala Massacre, August Kranti, the 1946 riots, or better yet, take it to Lucknow's history, where your film is set, and see how much better it would look. Overall, an expected debacle from Prime Video and NGE, but what was wrong with Nitesh Tiwari?RATING - 4/10*","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWY2NDMwYjYtMjVjMC00YjJiLThmMDEtZmFjNzVmZWMxODkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@._V1_UY209_CR34,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This is a truly awful movie. There is no plot or overall story to the film. It is just about Jolene travelling around the country going from guy to guy. She learns nothing about her experiences and leaves us feeling absolutely no sympathy towards her character whatsoever, in fact our lack of sympathy for her comes very early on in the movie and lasts for the entire duration despite one attempt near the end which seems very rushed and forced. As Joelene moves on in her journey she comes across numerous characters and different situations, each of these situations being the same as the last one and leaving us wondering if this film is actually going to go anywhere or not, or if a plot or story is going to unfold at some point. The makers of this film had access to a great cast. I've seen these actors shine in other movies which makes it even more shocking to me that they decided to take a part in this film, none of the roles did the actors talents any justice. The script is terrible and feels like it has been written by someone who has not experienced real life. The dialogue is very simplistic and the characters and situations seem very clichÃÂ©. I've seen these same characters and same events in other films, but done much better. There is nothing unique about any of it. The wardrobe, set dressing and makeup also seems to be very amateur, camp and over dramatic. One character in particular, 'Coco' has been made to look exactly like Johnny Depp, reminiscent of the way Depp looked in his early years, which is very cringe making. The actor playing Coco also looked very much like Orlando Bloom and so I spent much of his screen time trying to decide whether it was him or not, due to the actor's bad accent which got me thinking 'Is this Orlando Bloom trying to do an American accent?', however I was wrong, it wasn't Bloom. The actress playing Jolene wasn't that bad and I would like to see her in more films, however the script and directing could not save her on this occasion. I would like to see what she could do with a solid script and a better director. There was absolutely no flare from the director, it was very conventional and safe movie making. The script was bad, but the director could have made something a lot better out of it, unfortunately he failed to do so. I know this film was based on a book, but I am judging this movie by itself and I am afraid that it falls very short. If you are looking for an entertaining movie which will take you on a journey, this is not the film for you. I've seen these characters and scenarios before. It's like 'Forest Gump' with a woman, and done badly. This has TV Movie written all over it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMzI1MTA3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgyOTAxNA@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

After seeing the film, I wanted to learn more. The End of the Tour (dir. James Ponsoldt) is a very reflective film, highlighting author Wallace on the last stretch of his book tour for his novel Infinite Jest. Our entry point into this intriguing man is David Lipsky, a Rolling Stone reporter hired to do a piece on him in the late 1990s.What little there is of plot is made up for in excellent characterization. The film is really all about existentialism, and thankfully it never leans towards pretentiousness. Rather there is an air of optimism about making your time on earth worthwhile. Wallace and Lipsky in a way represent two extremes of existentialism. Wallace is very relaxed, and takes his newfound celebrity with a grain of salt, while Lipsky is very Type-A, yet never brash or irritating. Lipsky has been trying to get his foot in the door as an author for a while now, while Wallace almost became famous overnight, and the film plays with the concept of ""fame"" in fun and unique ways. Through the film, Ponsoldt is able to explore these two extremes and find common ground between them, all while touching on the idea of fame and what it means to different people.The script is outstanding, and hits all the right notes I touched on above. The dialogue between Lipsky and Wallace feels natural, nothing is forced. I wonder how much improvisation was done for the film, because the two seem like good friends from the moment they meet. There is a natural chemistry that draws these two characters together, and it's outstanding to watch on-screen. It's difficult to adapt a book like Lipsky's, which is mostly interviews and recording, as the book was published after Wallace's death in 2008. But screenwriter Donald Marguiles makes it work, and the result is an insightful, often hilarious film.All this talk about chemistry would be a waste if it weren't for Jason Segel and Jesse Eisenberg as Wallace and Lipsky, respectively. Segel is a marvel as Wallace; it's a performance that doesn't demand much, yet Segel taps into all of Wallace's nuances and quirks. His delivery, cadence, and warmth almost makes it feel like you're talking to an old friend. It's a subtle performance that I hope is remembered come awards season. Eisenberg, too, is great. His reporter-type isn't very developed until the middle-end of the film, and he might come across as annoying for some. But he makes Lipsky tick as the curious interviewer wanting to learn more. He's driven by his desire to success, his want to make a successful piece for Rolling Stone, yet he ends up with a lot more.The End of the Tour is a huge success. It isn't a very showy film, without much in the way of technical prowess, yet it's a talker. The realistic dialogue and blasÃÂ© tone make the film feel like a 140 minute hang out with two good friends. Ponsoldt keeps a tight grip on the film's themes, never letting one overpower the film's true intentions. It's a wonderful ode to Wallace, and a funny one at that.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwODU3NjQxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE2NTE4NTE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

On his way to his in-laws with his family, Frank Harrington decides to try a shortcut, for the first time in 20 years. It turns out to be the biggest mistake of his life.","219","A fun as hell genre flick that never pretends to climb Mt. Everest and thus leaves the viewer with more than just a feeling of simple satisfaction, but one of raw enjoyment.","Further proof that Hollywood just doesn't get it right anymore.When it comes to the horror genre, simplicity is beyond best. It's the one genre where frequently the more feeble the material, the better it can be.Dead End is an avatar of this principle. The plot is essentially just a concept film; family driving in a car, lost on a road that seems to not end, encountering things beyond explanation along the way. There isn't anything complicated about that and there shouldn't be anything complicated about that. It's a script that builds in on itself, instead of expanding outwards into new territory - yah, I said territory. It doesn't continue to introduce new elements to the fold, in the first 7 minutes it throws it's hands up and says, ""this is what you're gonna get, so take it."" And I applaud the filmmakers for this. It's something seldom done in the genre these days. All too often do horror scripts follow a formulaic plot that spirals outwards instead of simply just constructing a boxed in realm of the film's reality and then letting the character's react realistically within it. Dare I say it is actually rather Shakespearean in this way? Oh, I dare. Shakespeare was known for creating a story, believable characters and then letting the play unfold as if the characters were realistically responding to the world created around them. This is exactly the scenario with Dead End. It avoids the most common pitfall of the genre; characters that act without logic, without interest and without motivation. It's something scriptwriters should pay considerably more attention to. Characters like these possess some kind of magical power that gives a +20 to any cinematic enjoyment. I cast magic characters! And speaking of those characters, their actions may be realistically responsive, but if it weren't for the remarkably energetic performances of all the cast then all would be for naught. Ray Wise is the man in this movie. He is just badass without being over the top. He has created out of the father a man who is just trapped in an obviously humdrum life and transformed him into someone you just can't help but smile at every time he curses at his family. He is just great. Great, great, great. If I had to recommend the movie for any one single reason, it would be to just enjoy Ray Wise.The rest of the cast is fantastic as well, Wise doesn't eclipse the few other actors there are, but they all compliment each other like they really were a family. It is the definition of on screen chemistry.Now, the question you're asking, is it scary? Yes and No. No, it isn't balls-to-the-wall horror. It does fall prey to the optimism of the genre, but it's excusable and I'll get to that in a minute. The script is kinetic, always driving ahead and only pausing as long as necessary to make a point or get in a scare. It's because of this that the film will never scare the **** out of you, but when it wants to it'll keep your heart rate elevated to the point that you're aware of it enough to say to yourself, ""hey, this movie is kinda freaking me out."" I respect that. It knows it isn't hardcore, so it does exactly what it should and keeps your blood pumping a little faster than normal throughout. I love that feeling. But I also have a wild imagination and so was consistently prepped for an entry into the negative space of the car windows or emerging ever so slightly from the edge of the woods. And that'll freak my junk out more effectively than what you do see.As for the film falling victim to the optimism of the genre. This is true, but it is appropriately so. It doesn't establish throughout the rest of the movie that it should be taken as the hardest of horror, so no pretending means no disappointment in the end. Oh, and worth an important note for most viewers, there isn't a whole lot of gore, it really does leave a lot up to the imagination (as it should), but what blood there is isn't over the top and there are no CGI scares. Take that for what it's worth, but it's worth a lot to me.That said, I would have preferred a different ending. Not solely because I would have preferred a darker ending, but simply because the ending has an air of unreliability to it. It attempts to mollify the question that the movie never asks, but obviously the viewer will (""what exactly is happening here?"") and I felt that wasn't really necessary. I liked that the movie wasn't raising question after question. I liked that it turned its back to the whole issue, so when the events of the last two or three minutes of the film hit the viewer, or me at least, they feel out of place.All in all, this is movie that strips away the gloss and glamour prevalent to the genre as of late, establishes the concept and then happily throws what it's got left at the wall. Yes, it doesn't all stick, but the little things that don't are more than shadowed by the much larger portions that do. Dead End is worth your time and money. Rent it and watch it by yourself or with a date, but not in a group. A group would kill the pleasant intimacy that makes the film work beyond its bounds.I'm hesitant to say instant classic, because obviously it won't be universally so, but it deserves that accolade in my book. Check it out.The one sentence review: Dead End is a fun ass genre flick that never pretends to climb Mt. Everest and thus leaves the viewer with more than just a feeling of simple satisfaction, but one of raw enjoyment.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM2YWZhMjktMDk5My00YzMxLTk5ZDAtNmM0NTkyMDZmMWE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

How wrong I was! The movie goes wrong the second these two meet for their blind date and never looks back. The main reason I think I had such a disconnect with this movie is because the characters do not act like any living person on this planet. Furthermore, Sandra Bullock does not have a clear role to play: she's vacillates between being sophisticated and clueless, at all times when it's convenient for the plot. I don't know if I was supposed to sympathize with her or not, but the eventual effect was annoyance! It's not a good sign when you're hoping that they just leave her at the bottom of that well. Bradley Cooper basically just smiles throughout the movie.The movie also can't decide what genre it wants to belong to. It tries to be a comedy, a drama of self discovery, a satire of cable news, and a natural disaster movie (whether it be tornado or abandoned well) and fails at all attempts. Let it be said that the tornado looks good and that's about the best thing I can say about this movie.I think I laughed twice during the film, but I can't remember if it was related to what was on screen or my on disbelief that I was in this theater.

This film has all the elements of the Italian mystery/thriller genre known as the giallo, but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his/her own closet. This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who is killing the young boys in town? The young rich woman who is so bored that she sexually taunts the eventual victims, the reporter who likes to tamper with a crime scene to get a better photo shot, the townswoman with a mentally disabled daughter, the local witch, the town idiot....the list goes on, and you have to keep mental notes like a true game to play and solve. The themes in this film are very daring and done with that perfect Italian style in the early 1970s. It is certain that no American studio would have even considered making a film of such strong content, and that is precisely why this is such a satisfying film (despite some unusual accent choices for the dubbing for the English language version -- You'd do yourself a favor by watching it in its original Italian language, as that is how the actors spoke) and will definitely have people discussing its meanings long after viewing it. As the saying goes, they don't make them like this anymore, so get a copy and cherish an important film like this one!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjRkNzgwZmYtMGQ1Zi00NTk2LTkxZWUtNjU2MjQ0ZGIxZjI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTU0NTE4MTkz._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

And just like everything else Goldman touches, this is a stinker. A big, shiny, brown, unflushable log of turgidity.What could have been an interesting murder mystery set in the lawless East End of Victorian London, is instead a mess of plot holes, historical inconsistencies and terrible ""Cockanee"" accents. At times Olivia Cooke seems to be channelling Dick Van Dyke. Indeed, gore and porn are used to gloss over a story that lacks depth or interest. Again, the blame lies with Goldman as the source novel has received plenty of critical praise. As a historian and expert on Victorian London, Ackroyd will (if he's honest with himself) be annoyed at the disrespect with which the source material has been treated.But inaccuracies and crap accents aside, the biggest problem with this film is that it's just plain boring. Yawningly boring. Fall-asleep-if-you-could boring. Watch-that-bloody-loud-Cineworld-4DX-advert-with-the-car- chase-100-times-instead boring.The fact that this movie had it's premiere in 2016 and has only just made it into cinemas in August 2017 proves that someone in the studio realised there was a problem. And a glowing review from Derek Winnert isn't going to alter the fact that this is boring tosh with a shiny gloss.Despite Bill Nighy's best efforts, you simply won't care who the killer is. Nighy is a professional, and you can tell he's trying - but the script is a steaming pile of donkey doo-doo. Worse still, you'll have guessed who the killer is within the first 30 minutes anyway.The fact that the final act makes little-to-no sense at all just increases the feeling that you've been robbed - of the ticket price and two hours of your life.

My original enthusiasm faded quickly only after 10 minutes into the film.Let me explain: ""In Dubious Battle"" is one of the best Steinbeck novels, as important classic as its companion piece, the unforgettable ""Grapes of Wrath"", which not only happens during the same time period, also deals with the same issues of this era. ""In Dubious Battle"" hasn't been filmed before, for obvious reasons, as it has much more clear political message in it, as the main characters are members of the American Communist Party, who are sent on a mission to fight for fair wages among the apple pickers, who are mostly vagrant families and other victims in the downfall of the economic collapse, which lead to the Great Depression. Unlike ""Grapes of Wrath"", ""In Dubious Battle"" is mainly about how destructive and unfair the labour laws were during that time, which enabled rich land owners to exploit the destitute workers to the maximum, giving them basically wages which wouldn't have even covered the expenses of food and shelter.However... I find it near inexcusable for what the writers and the director have actually done to this masterpiece of source material. Some of the most memorable scenes and events in the book, have been completely either written out or have been softened or edited into something completely different, which no longer does any justice to the original Steinbeck novel. This has lead to very visible and easily noticeable mistakes and clear errors in the production of the movie. There are totally unforgivable errors of fluid continuity via truly strange film editing, mainly in form of abrupt cutting, which even leave seriously weird time gaps: -As an example, one of the most memorable scenes in the book, is the first meeting between Al and the newly arrived Jim & Mac, has been butchered to a bare minimum, which fails to deliver any of the originally intended importance of this meeting. This is the first truly odd of really weird cuts throughout the film, which leaves in amateur like time-lapses. There should have been a complete scene, where Al prepares for them a free meal out of sympathy and after being flattered, a hamburger steak with mashed potatoes and thick brown gravy, which is described meticulously in detail by Steinbeck in the book, using almost two pages to underline both the hunger of Jim & Mac, and to establish the future important relationship between Al, his father and Jim & Mac.I would see the main culprit for this travesty being mainly the director James Franco. His direction clearly shows he doesn't seem to have any emotional attachment for telling this important story, which is evident in how much has been actually left out from the original complete story. Franco hasn't done anything to cover the obvious and weird time gaps and missing events in this movie. It would be justified to say that Franco probably hasn't concentrated nearly as much as he should have. Could be out of interest or just lacking adequate motivation. In any case, I am not impressed with Franco's directorial work. He is still much better as an actor. As a director he has made silly mistakes and unforgivable editorial choices, which do effect the entire movie's atmosphere and how well the story is being delivered to the viewers. As it stands now, the movie lacks emotion, dynamic and empathy for the story or the characters.The second fail point for this movie is its casting - Almost the entire cast of the main characters appear to be far from being motivated, and this has lead to a display of some of the most mediocre acting performances of 2016. The only exception to the rule is Vincent D'Onofrio, who is playing London, and even in his case, just barely. I find just about everything disappointing in this film, cinematography certainly isn't doing any justice to it either, and this could be possibly because the sets aren't in any way convincing that this is early 1930's, the camera angles are to put it mildly, unconventional, there are close shots, when the scene would have rather called for medium or even long shots and then there are long shots in place of close shots. In some places the seriously weird cutting disrupts even viewers ability to follow the story, as the cuts don't make any sense. The third low point is the soundtrack, which doesn't fit the movie, or the time-line, when the movie is supposedly happening.Finally... Even with all the shortcomings in this movie, it is still watchable and even enjoyable (with strong reservations), but don't expect a clear and concise masterpiece. It works also much better for those people who haven't read Steinbeck's novel, but fails to convince most of the film scholars and academics, who will easily spot the many flaws in this production.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmVkYzE1ZmQtOWRkZi00ZjgwLTk4YWQtMzk1M2E5MjhlMDcyL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTY0MTkxMTg@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

What characterization does exist is created with broad and boring strokes of writing.

Really!","Which is a startling achievement.The definition of smug is ""having or showing an excessive pride in oneself or one's achievements."" And this strange, self-conscious, and terribly annoying film takes that notion to levels I have never seen.Which is saying something because I watch (and review) a lot of films.The smugness is so extreme that -- a horrible failing for a reviewer -- I am at pains to describe it.It uses devices to enhance its smugness which, when the script was initially being pitched to the money guys, must have sounded positively brilliant, but, in reality, are as much fun as a root canal.It starts with massive backstory -- but. then gives you a giant screen caption ""backstory"" so YOU know the WRITER KNOWS that this. and therefore you are part of an INSIDE JOKE.It dispenses clichÃÂ©s like an ATM that has taken a lightening strike. Memories of a sexy babysitter, a mother who abandoned the narrator, friends who want to go to Malaysia because the women there appreciate under-sized appendages (""and you can rip them up""); old girlfriends who, after a single phone call, will meet you at a street corner, hop in your car, and perform an oral act below window level while the local cop nods approvingly....It is almost as if --- this seems to be the real story -- someone in Hollywood, on a dare, was asked to take the worst script he could find and get it produced with a handful of A-List stars.And actually won the bet.I like to talk about ""connection"" in my reviews and how important it is for the viewer to relate to the material on screen. The only way for a viewer to connect with this film is if the viewer is currently institutionalized for psychotic narcissism.Perhaps I am not being clear. This is not merely a bad film, because a lot of Indies are called that when in fact they actually represent someone's attempt to make a really good film ... which failed.This is a bad film because someone who considers themselves smarter than everyone else in the room went out of their way to prove it.Which, as I said, makes it the smuggest film ever made.(Go back to top line of review. Wash. Repeat.)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwMjA2ODU3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjk2MDA2NTE@._V1_UY209_CR8,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It was a 30-year-old labor of love that Richard Williams promised to be the greatest animated film ever, before it was taken away by his creditors. All he cared about was the perfection of the art, rather than the restrictions of schedules and budgets. What happened to the movie was awful, but the remaining animation shines through, greatly. I, for one, was very upset with the release of the Miramax version on DVD, with only pan and scan, and a lack of extras. It was an insult to the original version. I really hope the restoration project is revived soon. A fully restored Director's cut is my on and only ""Dream DVD"". That film really changed my life and outlook on animation. It deserves more recognition and it's a great learning exercise for animators. Stay away from the Miramax version.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTE5YzNlMTEtZWVkMi00OGY3LTkwOTktMjExZjQ4NTMzMDdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI0MTAwMjEz._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Children movies are meant to be entertaining for young viewers to sit back and be in awe with something funny, fast paced and highly enjoyable. I understand. But ""Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I Feel Kinda Left Out"" is one of the worst children films that I have seen.The film suffers from a lack of charm as the characters, setting, and environment doesn't offer much to make the story creative or interesting in the slightest. The main story feels like it would work perfectly for Television either on Cartoon Network or Nickelodeon but the way it was written and it's direction doesn't make things better and very sloppy. Many of the performances were not good and the actors were trying their best but they seem to really struggle on trying their best. Most of the humor felt stale and the dialogue moments were really poor and felt forced as if the film was trying it's hardest to be in the TikTok eras. The special effects and costumes were poor as if they looked like something you would seeing from the early 2000s, the soundtrack was annoying, and the direction was all over the place.Most of the characters were really uninteresting and if I had seen this a child, I may have been invested with them. I saw this online and I allowed my young siblings to see it since they enjoy watching science fiction stories. While he did enjoy some moments, he didn't seem to be able to fully grasp the film and did almost fall asleep halfway. That's really saying something. At the end, this is mainly for children and I understand this isn't a film for my demographic. I am sure many children might enjoy this film as there are characters and scenes they would like. But honestly, this was really really bad.Rating: F.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWU5OGI3MzMtNTAzNy00NTI2LTkyMTgtNDZmYzVkZWNmMDJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I thought it looked terrific. (For the record, nearly every professional critic I could find singled out the film's strong visuals.) The character differentiation is very strong in the mice & rats -- and all that tender-loving detail in Ratworld and Mouseworld! You'd have to watch the movie 6 times to pick out all the tiny man-made objects the rodents have used for furniture, clothing, etc.I see also several reviewers' concerns about the film's ""darkness."" Ummm . . . don't we find Hans Christian Andersen a bit dark too? Isn't there something about kids being baked in an oven? And doesn't someone's father die in ""Lion King""? And a certain famous mother in that deer movie . . . ? For the matter of that, fans of DiCamillo's Newbery-winning book can tell that her version is a lot darker -- heart-breaking at times. At least one critic has scolded the film version for toning down the darkness, which concomitantly weakens DiCamillo's message of forgiveness and redemption.AND: I don't think I've ever heard vocal work this good in an animated film. They're not big box-office names that will draw tons of kids to the picture, but real pros -- Hoffman, Ullman, Hinds, Watson, and that narration by Sigourney!! -- who bring an amazing richness and authenticity to the characterizations.Plus, any movie that so convincingly counsels little kids to say ""I'm sorry"" -- well, even if it had no other merits, it's hard to argue with a message like that!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0MTc5MTc1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgwNDE4MQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"
