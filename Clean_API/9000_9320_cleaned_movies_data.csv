Or just behave stupidly.","The movie wants to make us believe this really happened in 2015 to a young American couple, but from everything I can find out it appears to just be a fictional story, based on an urban legend.The young 20-something couple travel to Australia for a ""get away"" trip, on the flight over he presents the ring, he asks her to marry him. But she doesn't appear ready, she says she loves him but hasn't decided yet what she wants to do with her life. That gives a bitter start to their trip but they try to make the best anyway.Their troubles start when with inadequate preparation he relies on his phone GPS to guide them to a destination. However it seems to give them faulty guidance, they basically get lost and from there the poor decision just mount and mount.I watched it on DVD at home and I must admit I skipped quickly through the scenes where he drank his urine.I have watched a lot of movies, averaging roughly 200 to 250 new movies a year for the past 20 years. I can recognize a poor movie when I watch one and this is a poor movie. I find myself wondering ""why was Outback made?"" If I were to arrive at a summary it would be ""preparation is everything when traveling to a strange place."" They did not, they made stupid decisions, they suffered the consequences. It doesn't take 90 minutes to deliver that message.I didn't find anything particularly interesting in the characters or their predicament. I could not recommend this movie to anyone.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYwOWIxNTYtMGU5NC00NTY3LTg2YTUtYjcyMzg1YTNiOTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTg4MDYyNw@@._V1_UY209_CR6,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

She sees him as the solution to all her problems, but his intentions are not what they seem.","17","It doesn't make you care.","Saw this for the Sundance festival, and it was a huge disappointment coming from the short film version of the same name. While the short film had the better main actress (she seemed more innocent, more believable, had a better singing voice, a more pleasant appearance, etc.,), this full length version had Jonathan Tucker. Having been a fan of his films since he started as a child actor, I knew he would be impressive as the role of the 'creepy dude' in this...and he was. Yet the slow pacing of the film and the drawn out unnecessary scenes centered around the lazy girl with equally lazy friends managed to swallow Tucker up completely. It felt like a waste of talent. I didn't think the director would take this version the direction that she did considering how the short film ended, and that was another disappointment. It was quite unrealistic and too grotesque to take seriously. As a woman it is becoming increasingly hard to watch movies made by women if this is the result. I've seen so many lately with the same qualities...slow pace, unrealistic drama, boring typical dialogue and almost all character development is non existent. They don't know how to make you care. This movie is another great example of that.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTZjOTgwZDktY2IyNy00ZmYyLWJjOWMtODgxYWNmYmQwZjkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAyMjQ3NzQ1._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

(If you've ever seen the original ""Children of the Corn"", you'll know what I mean.) The fight scenes here are SO incredibly lame. I've seen 2nd graders stage better mock combats in school plays. It doesn't help that the script seems to have been written by a moronic middle-schooler. No clichÃÂ© goes unturned here, no mundane sword-&-sorcery trope untouched. I read the first three of John Norman's 'Gor' books when I was in high school and much more interested in the genre, and even then I didn't think that they were anything special. But at least they held my attention for the first few books in the series (probably mainly because of the sexy Boris Vallejo covers and the stories' liberal doses of bondage-themed sex). This movie has none of those elements. The only two good things about it are the vigorous, hearty (and often inappropriately utilized - good job, Fritz, you inept stooge) musical score and Rebecca Ferrati's breasts.

Apparently not everybody was privileged to be born in 1955 and spend a childhood marinating in the Cold War puns and snarky anti-corporate digs of the original TV show. This movie brought it all back; if you had nothing to be brought back to . . . well, it's your loss. Renee Russo is fabulously snakey as Natasha, and tho' Rocket J. Squirrel couldn't improve on the original, that's because he was voiced by the original, the unsinkable June Foray. The only people who need to apologize for this movie are its promoters, who never figured out how to hook its natural audience of 40-somethings.I can't wait for the remake of Fractured Fairy Tales.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNiYmIwNjItNTYzNC00NzQyLTlkOTEtM2M4NDg4NTQxYmMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMzE4Mzg@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I grew up with Bruce Lee and from the direction of the director, I see where the movie is going to, whether it's historic or not. Before anyone else say anything about the western boxer in this movie, I lived through the end 70's of Asian martial arts world and I must say it has has it's share of ""to the death boxing matches"". Growing up in asia, we have had our share of nonregulated matches where contestant signed papers which declared their fight to the death. So it is no surprise that in this movie such a scene would occur. Not having TV at that time, the thrill of hearing such a match from radio (I remember my first Ali match and it was also on Radio, not TV) I can sympathise for the director's broad representation of history. On the whole, when Ip Man told his disciple Leung, that he wasn't trying to teach him how to fight but to teach him the values of ""martial morals"", reminded me of my martial arts training under my master. Movies reflect life and in this moment of the film, I totally understood what the movie was going to.I can only say, seek the truth and not be blinded by what is presented.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM2MTcyMDgtZTZkNS00NTg5LWIwNzEtMmY1Y2I1MTZjYTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Great fun!","A word of warning: don't see this expecting intellectually challenging cinema. Naked Weapon is any man's wet dream- gorgeous female assassins go to exotic locations and take out high profile baddies (with mandatory sexy dancing before the kill). The action might seem a bit tame for hardcore kung-fu fans (lots of wires and floaty camera moves disguise lack of fighting talent on the actors' parts), but for those of who just want to see some mindless violence, it does the job nicely. Unfortunately the plot has no direction (one set piece after another), and the dialogue is laughably bad. Thankfully, the cheesy lines are so bad they are actually quite entertaining, and blend in nicely with the whole B-movie feel of the film.Far better than I expected- slick and escapist scenarios, high production values, and the action is great fun. I must however warn potential viewers that Daniel Wu is unspeakably bad as the earnest CIA guy on the tail of the killers- all he has to do is fill the audience in on the plot every now and again and get his ass kicked once. How hard can that be? Anyway, he messes that up nicely.To conclude, Naked Weapon is the perfect film if you've been out drinking, come home at about 2.00 in the morning, and want to see a film where brain power is not expected from the audience.

However, as an American who did NOT grow up watching them (and no one in the States did), I have a very, very hard time understanding why they were so loved. After all, at least to me, they look like an extended episode of ""The Benny Hill Show"" with actual nudity along with all the smarmy and low-brow humor....very, very low-brow humor.This installment finds two morons trying to get their girlfriends to accompany them to a nudist colony by tricking them. When I said it reminded me of Benny Hill--but this also looked like a 1980s slutty teen comedy but with older and unattractive leads. If you LIKE smutty humor that has absolutely no cleverness or finesse, then this film is for you! In addition to genuinely broad and dim writing, there are some horribly broad performances. The worst was the guy who played Dr. Soaper--most 6 year-olds are more subtle and professional! Not all the actors are THAT bad, but most are at least in the same ballpark as Soaper.I am sorry, but I am the dissenting voice. I hated this film and just saw it as smutty and unfunny.

This puritanical community in remote Denmark is missing an adequate appreciation of all of God's gifts in creation. They have taken the dualism of St. Paul to an extreme, and stress the life of the ""spirit,"" not the life of the ""flesh."" Both elderly sisters, in their youth, were frightened by the lure of love and the temptations of life outside their simple village. They, and their parishioners, cling to the narrow biblical interpretation of their former leader, and the sisters' father. The aging congregation has become testy and quarrelsome, and the sisters don't know what to do. Enter Babette, a French stranger, and someone to whom they can show kindness. They have no way of knowing that she will ultimately return their kindness and give fertile soil to their dry, dusty theology. Babette will give everything she has, and in the process, will teach the sisters and their flock about grace, about sacrifice, about how sensual experience (as in the bread and wine of the Eucharist) can change lives, and about why true art moves us so deeply. When they can forgive each other, and themselves, they can focus on God's love that unfolds before them in a concrete way in the present. As a minister, and an artist, I can't recommend a movie more highly. True art and true grace!!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWVjOWMzYTctOTUxYi00YTVkLWEwNjEtM2Q1NTg0MjhlMzIwL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjgyNjk3MzE@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It is not really Dakota's fault, but to be honest I wasn't really impressed with her this time around. I felt like she was a little too much, a little too melodramatic, and definitely not as real as she is in her other films. The real problems with this film lie in the directing, the script, and the pacing. It's poorly filmed (though beautifully lensed), the script panders to too many stereotypes to even enumerate, and even though it's very short, it crawls along.All the controversy about the rape is unfounded, too, because it actually is only a very small piece of the movie. You see her face twice and her hand once, and you hear her. I'd say it was 45 seconds. Maybe not even that long.Anyways, color me disappointed. Definitely not worth all the hype, and I really wish Dakota could have found a better filmmaker(s) and film(s) during all the time she wasted as this film sat in preproduction.

The little we did get about a chef with a gambling problem assuming someone's identity didn't even scratch the iceberg though. This film was an absolute blast from start to finish.I don't think I'll ever forget the minute the ball drops in this film. It was said so casually and reacted to so calmly that I thought I must've misheard or misunderstood. I didn't though and from there on out we were on a wild ride.The film is dark, but also often hilarious. It finds a great balance in terms of how seriously to take itself, certainly leaning heavily towards the serious side, but just enough tongue-in-cheek moments to realise just how out there of an idea this is.

The fighting is incredible in this film and the stunts are quite impressive, the choreography and the stunts are what make this film good, don't expect a great story or any great acting.The story isn't nearly as bad as I expected it to be, it's actually quite interesting and takes a little bit of step aside from Jackie Chan's typical cop character.  This time he's simply a TV chef that gets mixed up in things against his will.  It sounds pretty stupid, but it's not all that bad.The acting and even more so, the dialogue are two things that I'm not even going to begin to defend.  The acting is pretty bad at times and the dialogue is god-awful!  Sadly, a lot of the bad dialogue could easily have been avoided, I don't know what the writers/director was thinking.Virtually all of the cast members were new faces to me, with of course, the exception of Jackie Chan.  Jackie does a good job with his role, exactly what you would expect from one of his films.  I feel I have to mention Gabrielle Fitzpatrick, what a beautiful actress!!!  And she's actually a pretty good actress, I'll definitely be keeping an eye open for her future work.If you are a fan of Martial Art films, or just like Jackie Chan, then watch this movie.

You know it must be pretty insulting to war veterans if Ike himself bothered to become a movie critic and denounce it as demeaning to our soldiers and their memory.I try never to say I hate something, but I hate this movie on every possible level. In the war movie genre, it's a zero. In the historical recreation genre, it is a sub-zero. As an action picture, it is unbelievable. Quite simply the only reason anyone should watch this thing is to catalog a list of things you should avoid doing if you ever decide to make a war movie.By now, you've already read about the gaffs: The anachronisms like a German reading Playboy magazine in the background. The cheap and silly plastic-models-on-a-tabletop war scenes ala Godzilla, The breathtaking inappropriate location of the filming on the Spanish plains instead of using, if not Belgium, then at least some northern European forest country with snow! I mean, my God, would you film a movie about Eskimos in Venezuela? And some reviewers here struggle to make apologies for all this, saying in essence ""So what? It was a fun war movie."" Who cares if it was filmed in a desert instead of the Ardennes forest? Who cares if they made the Germans into cartoonish Nazis and the Allies into G.I. Joe and Sgt. Rock comic book heroes? Who cares if almost nothing is as it was during the battle?Well then, why bother to make a movie with the specific title ""Battle of the Bulge"" at all? Why not just call it, ""Clash of the Panzers""? I know, it was the 1960s and it was just meant to entertain and jerk a few bucks out of people's pockets with gimmicks like Cinerama and marquee brand names like Henry Fonda. I know all that.But it was an insult to the vets who fought and died there. They said it at the time it was made. I can't get beyond that. I have walked the forests and fields around Bastogne where my father endured such an ordeal he would not ever speak of when he was alive. I've walked among the white gravestones of men who died there. I can't bring myself to get to, ""So what? It's just a movie."" Neither, apparently could the many vets who decided to take their families to this picture when it was released, and then had to sit there, embarrassed and speechless as this movie made a mockery of their struggle.I fully expect that I'll get a negative rating as to how many people found my comments ""useful,"" but that's OK. From what I've seen, people tend not to like criticism of a film based on subjective, rather than objective remarks. In this case however, I don't care if I get a single ""useful"" vote. This movie was a travesty in its day, and worse now with the passage of time. It is truly the ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" of war movies.But ending on a positive note: I'd like to see somebody do a spoof film about the making of this movie and how everybody from the screenwriters, to the director and actors and location scouts to the extras in the background didn't give a flying flip about what they were working on except getting a paycheck. That, I'd watch.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDEzMWI4ZWMtNGFiMy00M2QzLTlhZWUtY2QwZTcyYzMwODAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The movie was politically incorrect and downright insensitive to the others who fought the Japanese in World War 2.  There was a scene where I almost vomited, it showed Macarthur in a bunker in Corregidor island talking to the troops like a seasoned politician when he comes across a wounded, one legged Filipino soldier.  The soldier bleeding and dying manages to sit up straight upon seeing the general and says : `no papa, no mama, no uncle sam' and Macarthur gives his little pep talk that  Americans `would never abandon' the Philippines.  The scene ends with the soldier being invigorated by Macarthur's words and gives him a smart salute. I mean if there was a more condescending scene portraying the U.S. as the great white savior of the world please tell me because this one takes the cake.  It showed that Filipinos are damsels in distress incapable of honor and have to rely on the great Americans solely for redemption.  It blatantly and purposely overshadowed the contributions of the members of the USAFFE (United States Armed Forces of The Far East), these are Filipino volunteers that were integrated in the US military during world war 2, who died side by side with the Americans fighting the Japanese, who walked side by side with Americans in the death march of Bataan  and defended Corregidor island by launching a guerilla offensive after Macarthur left for Australia with his famous `I shall return' speech.  My late grandfather, a Filipino world war 2 veteran and USAFFE soldier was one of the many who fought the Japanese with honor and love for the home country.  I think this movie does not give honor to them and to the thousands of others that Macarthur relied on for intelligence preparations for his famous return in the Leyte gulf landing.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTRjMjYzNDEtMjNmNy00NzJiLWE0NDgtZDk1N2IzYjgzYTMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I would like to make a case for patience. After all, if true beauty and grace were delivered in one massive hit, our poor brains and hearts would not withstand the blow. In Down By Law, Jarmusch invites us to take some time, some real time and devote it to getting deeply involved with his characters. Men in crisis. Misfits, jailbirds, heartbreakingly human. We accompany them on their journey, their escape from their confines. It is a truly epic journey on a small geographical scale. We watch as they begin to mirror one another, as their individual egos become inextricably enmeshed in one another. We watch a friendship form. And how can we begrudge the time Jarmusch takes for this glorious exposition? How can we do anything but marvel at the fine detail in which the scenes are drawn, at the subtle movements of our heroes? Every gesture signifies worlds of meaning and consequence. And Jarmusch does it better, with more skill and with more compassion than anyone. If you are prepared to get involved, if you are brave enough to commit to the journey, you will be rewarded with a kind of epiphany that few films can offer.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ2ZGVlZTctZDllYy00YTVlLTk0ZWEtM2Y4ZjhjNGU0MzU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"
"Auto Focus","1986.0","R","105.0","Biography, Crime, Drama","6.6","66.0","Paul Schrader","Greg Kinnear, Willem Dafoe, Maria Bello, Rita Wilson","14,958","The life of TV starBob Craneand his strange friendship with electronics expert John Henry Carpenter.","133","Not for everybody, but definitely worth seeing","I believe that this was the most severely underrated film of 2002, and it was also my personal favorite for a great year in film. Now, I sincerely doubt that many moviegoers would consider this one of the year's best, or even a great film, so this comes with a tentative recommendation. I wouldn't recommend this movie to just anybody, but I feel that fans of the prior work of Scorsese and Schrader will consider this a worthwhile endeavor. With this work Schrader continues his legacy of disturbed, distorted, doomed men whose selfishness and shallow nature ultimately lead them to great suffering as they destroy those who come close to them. Greg Kinnear's Bob Crane joins the likes of DeNiro's Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, Gene Hackman's Harry Caul in The Conversation, and Nick Nolte's Wade Whitehouse in another Schrader masterpiece, Affliction. These are sad, empty men, for whom we can only half-sympathize; we feel for them because we suffer, but we condemn them because they force themselves and others to suffer.The film follows the sexual exploits of Greg Kinnear as Bob Crane, the real-life star of Hogan's Heroes, who during and after the show became a full-blown sex addict, ruining two marriages and possibly sabotaging his career in the process. Willem Dafoe is John Carpenter (no, I know what you're thinking, and he's not), Crane's partner in crime who lacks Crane's charisma with women but is fed some scraps by Crane in return for his extensive knowledge of and access to video equipment. Crane's fetish is using the home video cameras to record his sexual trysts, which he reviews over and over again, looking for something that we can't see, and that he probably can't see either.Kinnear and Dafoe's performances alone are worth the price of admission. This is the best, boldest, and most nuanced work that Kinnear has ever done. His performance is all subtlety and detail; he introduces Crane as a regular, aw shucks family man, but as the movie progresses we gradually see the facade fall as his quiet desperation and insatiable sexual appetite begin to consume him. Not content to go over the top and yell at the top of his lungs to be effective, Kinnear instead puts on a fake smile and charms with a velvety voice while openly degrading and hitting on women. The effect is one of the most genuinely creepy performances ever committed to film. Dafoe is the perfect companion to Kinnear's subtle predator; Carpenter is a pathetic loser, easily angered and easily hurt. He gets angry, yells, and does all of the things that you've seen Dafoe do in his other portrayals of guys you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley, or a lighted one, for that matter. It's effective elsewhere, and it's effective here. Together, these men form a pair so utterly joyless and shallow that just seeing them on-screen together made my stomach churn. Their dialogue is only incidental, usually reminiscing on previous sexual escapades or planning new ones, but it's the little tics, gestures, Kinnear's untouchable confidence foiled by Dafoe's insecurity, Kinnear's hidden hunger foiled by Dafoe's overt desperation, that give these scenes their resounding power.Not to shortchange Schrader's direction, though, which as usual is right on target for the material. He begins in a brightly colored, idealized suburban landscape, filled with all of the usual imagery you'd expect in this sort of light-hearted period and location. Then, slowly, he slides into darker territory, carrying us into the decadent seventies, breaking shots into shorter lengths, shaking the camera, depicting with his cinematography and editing the fall of his protagonist. Admittedly, the techniques Schrader employs here to depict Crane's breakdown have been used many times before, but I still found them extremely effective here.For the last thirty minutes of the film, I felt genuinely ill; not because I thought the projector was out of focus, as many have complained, but because Schrader and Kinnear were taking me to a dark place and immersing me in it. As I said before, this type of film is not for everybody, but for those interested in the dark side of man, this film is not to be missed. I think that at the very least, the merit of these depressing morality tales is that they provide an exact blueprint of the way not to live our lives. I suppose that showing Crane checking himself into therapy and dealing with his problems and utimately healing himself would be valuable as well, but it wouldn't make for a good film, or a true one. Some people argue against the very existence of this type of movie. My response to them is that in real life for every strong-willed person who solves their problems and triumphs over adversity, there is another loser who ultimately fails to deal with life and implodes upon their own insecurity and weakness. Until this changes, someone needs to continue making these films.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzVmMDZiMWUtN2FkYS00ZDBkLWFjODctZTJkYTdlOTY3YzU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The world's economy was crumbling under the impact of the oil shock, Richard Nixon's head was on the block and wars were raging in Vietnam, Ulster, Cyprus and Cambodia. If you were a randy adolescent, what better way to escape the madness than by slipping into a grotty pre-Multiplex era cinema, Barrat's sherbert fountain in hand, Pearl and Dean ads in your ears and explore the wonderful new world of the permissive society? The Joy of Sex had just been published, Aids was still many years away...what carnal delights could be had in those bell-bottomed, glammed up times? And if Confessions of a Window Cleaner's protagonist, young Timmy Lea, was at all typical, then being a demin-clad, rubber lipped minger was no barrier to scoring more hole-in-ones than Tiger Woods. Robin Askwith, previously a bit-part actor in Carry On Girls is introduced to us a what passes for an English stud in the days of Slade and three day weeks. He's no loser, the theme song assures us, he just 'doesn't ever win.' Scrubbing windows up and down Merrie England, he looks into a bedroom and sees a badly edited film of some nude girl oiling herself. His work puts him in contact with innumerable clapped out housewives whose 'botties' and 'beezers' are invariably popped out for the benefit of our (possibly clapped up) Cassanova. One wonders if the ever present threat of nuclear war with the Soviet Union spurred these women into getting as much 'crumpet' as possible before the real big bang. Anyway, Timmy's brother-in-law, Sid (Tony Booth) is soon to be a father but that doesn't stop him from chasing the skirt. Timmy himself spouts sexist attempts at humour 'What a knocker factory!' with such aplomb, there is a certain weird genius to Askwith's performance. It takes skill to portray a leading character who is such an unbelievably charmless neanderthal. Timmy puts it about but he finds himself falling for the blond Liz (no English Bardot but still light years out of his league) who inevitably takes a dim view of her boyfriend eying up nude school girls and so forth. Elsewhere, casual homophobia and racism make you wonder if the script writers just decided to sit in on a National Front pub quiz. As for the sex...well in the unlikely event of a 40th anniversary DVD in 2014 may I suggest a tag-line? (putting the 'rot' into erotica). But if one thing does make Confessions interesting is that, away from the smut and the crass humour (the likes of which make the Carry Ons look like The Simpsons) Confessions offers a view of 1970s urban England to complete with the angriest Ken Loach movie in terms of its dystopian bleakness. Peeling flock wallpaper and horrid furniture surround Sid and Timmy Lea in their council house while the apartments of some of the 'birds' whose windows they scrub are resplendently ghastly. Maybe there was a surfeit of wild sex to be had in those far off times. Watch this movie and conclude that it was small consolidation.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzE3NjA3M2EtYTIyZi00ZDUxLTk4MGEtOTQ3N2E4YTljMDA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

What about Mafia movies? Are those for people who are ""involved""? What about ""Seven"" I guess that's a cult classic for serial killers. Come on, a good movie is a good movie. Trust me I identified with Omar - and I'm a straight hispanic girl - probably more than I have with any other character in a movie. This movie is about homosexuality like Charlotte Gray is about hair dye.This movie is definitely one of my favorites. It is a look a young man (a gorgeous Pakistani named Omar) who basically tries to balance being Pakistani and British at the same time. He wants to have a business and be successful, in that Western capitalist way, and yet he wants to be good to his family and his father in that sense of family loyalty that only those of us from other cultures really understand. Omar asks his uncle to tell stories about his family in Pakistan, yet he doesn't understand his people's language - Urdu, I believe it is. This is a little insight for our white friends about what us ""in-betweens"" have to go through. Too ethnic for the white people, too white for our own people. It's nice to show the ethnic people looking down on the poor whites, because we do, we look down on low class white people, we have our snobbery too. It may not be right, but it's the truth. It's nice to show the sort of affectionate annoyance Omar found his Papa and Nasser for trying to help him. White people see that as overbearing, something to ""escape"" from (like Tania, who was the ""whitest"" of them all) Ethnic people have a sense of humor about it, because we know it means love, and like Omar most of us just choose to quietly listen and ignore their advice rather than make a scene. Omar never makes a scene.That's what Johnny represents I think, the part of us we keep to ourselves, our passions and desire and those things that are too special to share, kind of like a spiritual belief. It makes their love seem almost sacred because it's too special for them to bring out and expose to the criticism of less enlightened people. It's worth noting that it's Johnny who kisses Omar semi-openly in the street, and it's Omar who doesn't tell his family why he can't marry Tania. I dont think it's so much homophobia as it a cultural difference as to what should be kept private. I could sort of see Johnny in the future demaning Omar tell his family.Their love scene is gorgeous. When you first see Johnny he seems so rough and coarse and low class, but as he begins to seduce Omar while Omar talks about the past he suddenly seems powerful and sophisticated and . . . and just to see them getting it on on the table. It's very sweet and tender with the frantic kissing and the champange, but my god is it hot.This certainly is a romantic (and more importantly) positive movie where two men are in love yet have a real conflict between them, and obviously gay men are right to love that, but hey, it works for informing white people, making minorities laugh, British people who grew up during that time, showing idiot homophobes that gay people are just the same as everyone else, DDL fans.

Why is this so crucially important to her? The manuscript itself, as we see it playing out on screen, is a surreal erotic fantasy about a young woman who checks into a bizarre, labyrinthine hotel where all the guests and personnel are strange and lustful. As this modern-day Alice-In-Erotic-Wonderland, Clio Goldsmith has a good body but a thoroughly unattractive face - from certain angles, she positively looks like a man in drag. Back at the editor's office, Catherine Spaak and Fernardo Rey are much better - especially Rey, who has a way of making a movie seem better that it is simply because he appears in it. But all through this movie, you're waiting for some kind of revelation, some kind of connection between the ""real"" and the ""fictional"" world; it never comes. The ending of ""Honey"" provokes only a ""say what?""/""so what?"" reaction, and the whole ""reading the manuscript"" business turns out to be little more than a pretentious device.

What a difference! Apparently the filmmakers were anxious to get to Cannes and had not finished the editing. Although I liked it before-- this version really hits the spot without the confusing extras that were still at Cannes. I'm glad I gave it a second chance and in fact I'm now anxious to see it again when it's released. The film is very layered and subtle. It is beautifully shot and the four main characters are original and yet painfully familiar in their alienation, anger, and despair. The Cowboy character played by Edward Norton seems so simple at first but as he is drawn into the family his character and the truth of his 'being' gradually unravels in ways that left me speechless at the end of the film. The character played by Rory Culkin, ""Twig"", says very little throughout the film and yet he conveys a sense of yearning and loneliness almost too painful to bare. But even he undergoes an unexpected transformation by the end of the film. My favorite though, was Evan Rachel Wood. I think she steals the show... without trying at all. Her emotions and rebelliousness are raw and totally authentic. She is a luminous creature on the screen. Her relationship with the Cowboy seemed unlikely at first and then became completely believable, especially in the bathtub scene. My main criticism is that the film is demanding. If you're not in the mood to sink into a fairly deep experience with some shocking moments and unpredictable outcomes--don't waste your time. This is a film for lovers of independent film and psychological kinds of cinema. There are also several scenes that border on surrealism. I'd be interested to know more about the making of this film and look forward to the DVD. I imagine this film may take awhile to be discovered but it holds tremendous rewards for those patient and thoughtful enough to venture into it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzAxNTI5MzI3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTI0NDgzMQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Yes. Superbly crafted? Most certainly. A practical joke or fantastically manufactured lie? Despite what many of the conspiracy theorists here would tell you, no, it is not.The campaigning elements of the film may not sit well with some people, but the facts are the facts, and there's simply no denying the emotional impact this film has. It is a prime example of constructed film-making with an overt agenda, filled with elements that at time make it feel like a heist movie or spy thriller.Having said that, there's no doubting just how real the horrors are. The annual slaughter of thousands of dolphins in an isolated cove near Taiji is sickening, heart-wrenching and unnecessary. After select dolphins are taken for the world's aquariums, the rest are left for brutal and barbaric butchering. I for one appreciate the risks taken by the film makers in attempting to get this story out, and I would place good money on this documentary being a front-runner for next year's Oscars.One of the marks of a powerful documentary is the response it generates from the hordes of nay Sayers. Some of the absurdly laughable comments listed here on IMDb are begging to be called out and exposed for the pathetic lies that they are.Conspiracy theory/lie no.1: The premise of dolphins being slaughtered en masse in Taiji is a complete fabrication.This belongs in the same volume of crackpot collections as those who deny the dangers of global warming. It is indeed real, and there is a plethora of information available to anyone with 3rd grade research skills. An article by Minoru Matsutani appeared in the Japan Times on Sept 23rd this year covering the issues raised in The Cove. The practice of mass dolphin slaying is indeed confirmed.Falsehood no.2: That the scenes from Taiji's infamous cove were in fact filmed in Ottawa.People will fabricate lies without any thought of at least giving the lie some credibility. There is no evidence to support this ridiculous claim. And having personally travelled along the east coast of Honshu in 2001, I can tell you that this is indeed filmed in Taiji.Falsehood no.3: Dolphins are not native to Japan.Wrong. Dead wrong. Bottlenose dolphins, for one, inhabit all warm temperate seas worldwide Ã¢ÂÂ including Japan. In fact, Mikura Island has a permanent colony of bottlenose dolphins.I'm utterly delighted that this film is stirring up so much emotion, as this is exactly what is needed to spark change. Most people in Japan aren't even aware of this atrocity, and had it not been for this film, I seriously doubt many of them would have ever known.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM3NTRhMTctNTE2MS00YjJmLWE2ZmMtMmY3MWI0ODExMTMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA4NzY1MzY@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Costner turns out to have a very strong ""supporting"" role because the movie really is about Elijah Woods' character and the other kids who find out about the real war we human beings seem to fight daily. Excellent mix of humor, action, drama, sadness, and triumph. The ""dare"" scene inside the water tank was one of the more gripping I've seen in any film. I rate it ""8"" but almost feel it deserves a ""9"".Feb 2006 update. I saw it again, on DVD, and most of the movie was fresh again. After Costner's character was faced with killing people in the Vietnam war, he fully understood that love was the only thing fighting for.

Never mind the action scenes - Even simple dialogue scenes can be mangled and made unbearable with his magic touch.  Therefore, it comes as a surprise that ""Nemesis"" is so eminently watchable. Nice visuals, interesting ideas, evocative cyberpunk mood, good pacing, and a rather shocking grasp of effective action camerawork and editing.  I suspect that another director did most of the work on this one, but I've never been able to confirm.  All I know is that there are action scenes in here that are genuinely good, to the point where you might think you were seeing the work of a young but talented action stylist.  There's even a ""shoot through the floor gag"" that was ripped off wholesale recently for the Kate Beckinsale vampire/werewolf film, ""Underworld"".Of course, keep in my mind that this is a B-film.  It's lower budget and the acting isn't that great.  But among B-films, it's quite good.  As I said, the action is way above average in energy and style.  As well, the locations are varied, and it was one of the earliest films to achieve a William-Gibson-esque cyberpunk feel.  If that sounds interesting to you, then give Nemesis a rent.  BEWARE: Do NOT rent any of the sequels.  Pyun regained his usual golden touch for the sequels, producing what may be the most hate-inducing cinema known to man.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2M0MzEyYjQtNDI0Mi00YjhlLTliMGUtNTUzMTNkYmE5NzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

During the search, her lover and her best friend become attracted to each other.","106","Shallow Characters In A Very Deep Film","There's something strange going on in this film.The first time I watched it, it seemed to wash over me without affecting me in anyway. Later on(and I've read this in other people's comments here as well) I found images and dialogue from the movie creeping into my subconscious; entire dreams would take place upon the island where Anna goes missing(often in monochrome), or I'd start to compare real life events to those that occur during the film. Did Antonioni plant subliminal messages within the movie? Probably not. It's more likely the masterful pace he employs here, coupled with the busy, deep cinematography is the cause of this. Notice how the backgrounds NEVER go out of focus, no matter how much is going on within the frame. Check out the scene about an hour and ten minutes in, where Sandro and the old man are talking in the middle of an extremely busy street; nothing blurs or goes out of focus, even when a tram comes in and out of the shot, nothing loses it's perspective, and as the scene ends and they walk deep into the shot we can see way past them and far, far into the distance.This seems to be why the film has such a deep affect on the subconscious. The characters are deliberately shallow and are placed at the very foreground of every shot, yet the backgrounds are rich tableaux bustling with life. In the scenes on the island where Anna disappears, we see the main characters always in shot, yet in the background there is a feeling that something strange within nature itself is going on. The darkening of the clouds, the sudden mist upon the water, the rocks falling to the sea, even the sudden appearance of the old hermit character, all give a certain unease.There's also the haunting feeling of the film, as Anna's friends begin, almost immediately to forget about her. Soon, they don't seem to care a jot about her, and neither, in a sense, do we. It's this feeling of loose ends and guilt on our part(for joining her so called 'friends' in forgetting about her so quickly) that leaves the deepest impression. The characters in this film are so morally shallow(the ending bears this out) yet they are the reason this film leaves such a strong impression on those who watch it, and who become captivated by it.I cant recommend this film to everyone because I know that the Hollywood Blockbuster has reduced most modern cinema-goers attention spans to almost zero. But if you fancy a challenge, or merely wish to luxuriate in classic cinema.....begin here.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmJlYTVjZTYtZDg1Yy00NzFiLWJmYzYtYTJhMjliY2I2ZTlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjgyNjk3MzE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It has arguably one of the better animations from Chinese films, gorgeous cinematography and intriguing occult mystery premise, yet the plot is thin and superficial. If a comparison could be made, the movie resembles video game, it literally jumps through outlandishly eye-catching set pieces and while they might look attractive, the working narrative is extremely disjointed.Story mainly follows Hu Bayi as a member of archaeology team sent to uncover ancient secrets. He then meets with Yang Ping, the love interest and soon enough become the reason he volunteers for more dangerous mission. Eventually, the team finds creatures, relics, disasters and all sorts of oddities that the movie barely explains. Characters are ridiculously plain. Hu Bayi himself mostly follows order and narrates the plot while the heroine Yang Ping is depicted as mysterious female.These personalities are lacking depth, especially when the movie introduces a couple of comic reliefs that don't matter much for story. The plot has the same problems from Jackie Chan's The Myth from years ago, it's too flamboyant for the sake of fantasy appeal that it doesn't have much continuity or clarity. It merely throws around some over-the-top fantasy gibberish to usher in new shiny sequences.Fortunately, it does have some flashy spectacles. There's a clear investment on the visual presentation. The scenes are gorgeous, be it may the blue horizon from snow mountain or the trek across the desert. It's set in the right era with good nods to ancient trinkets and modern vibe, almost looking like The Mummy franchise for costume and design. Cinematography takes full advantage of the exotic location, the lightning, buildings and even details like banners or furniture add to the atmosphere.Special effect is top notch, there are a few moments when the cameras pan to the beasts and you can see the fur waving around in the wind or how the chains rattle on their neck. It's a definite improvement from stiff CG many Chinese movies used even in last year. There's a bit of imperfection with the editing and practical effect, but when the overall scene looks so inviting, it's entirely forgivable.In the end Chronicles of the Ghostly Tribe will leave audience with many aesthetically pleasing stages and also unsatisfied feeling on the story.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjczYjJjMGQtMTFmYS00MjdiLWE2MmMtOWY1YjA3OTcwMjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzUxMjgxNDQ@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

So I chose this movie, since it was a Fassbinder script directed by a Frenchman (Ozon) that I admire.  It was a delight.  Somehow the problems I always had enjoying Fassbinder (the intense cruelty between his characters, the disorienting emotional mood swings, the bleak, dreary German atmosphere) were completely offset by the sense of play and love of color and music that Ozon brings to this script. As in  8 Women, his sense of style and beauty rival Almodovar's and even the grim reality of Fassbinder has a beautiful, chic French gloss.  He understands that love and sex in Fassbinder are closely matched with jealousy and destruction.  It all clicked for me.  And the omnisexuality is so fresh - so unspoiled...

Then you discover the other bizarre characters and their relationships and the movie becomes, to me at least, extremely lovable.Admittedly, Rob Lowe's acting isn't up to much, and that's glaringly obvious here, but it doesn't destroy the film, and there's great work, as usual, from Jodie Foster to compensate.Basically, this is a light-hearted, feel-good film that I would expect to have mass appeal.

That I find truly refreshing.The movie is mostly accurate, from what I have read of the real event. There are a few notable exceptions where truth diverges from the movie, however. After quitting TRW, Christopher Boyce (AKA the Falcon) planned to learn Russian and earning a political major, and then returning to espionage for the Russians (the movie says the opposite). It makes you wonder how far he would have gotten, and how many other Christopher Boyce's there were during the cold war. In real life, Boyce and his lawyer tried to blame *everything* on the Andrew Lee (the Snowman), even saying Lee forced him into it. The Falcon escaped prison for an 18 month period before being recaptured. He was released from prison in 2003. Andrew Lee was paroled in 1998.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM4NTI0MjUzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTMzNzYzNA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Thirty years later, the secrets the Agents share come back to haunt them.","159","The Debt's potential is spoiled by sloppy writing","Is the truth actually what happened or what everyone believes happened? The Debt attempts to answer the question and almost succeeds if it were not for some very poor screen writing. It is 1966 and Mossad has finally tracked down the infamous Birkenau surgeon, Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen). Dr. Vogel is very high on the list of Nazi war criminals the Israelis are hunting down because of the atrocities he committed at his concentration camp. He would deliberately blind children to see if he could change eye color and cut off hands and feet and reattach them on the wrong limbs to see what happened.The spy team assigned to kidnap him and bring him to justice are team leader Stephan (Marton Csokas), David (Sam Worthington), and Rachel (Jessica Chastain). Their story is told in flashback and the first half of it is absolutely riveting. Rachel poses as a woman with fertility issues and becomes a patient of Dr. Vogel who is hiding as an OBGYN in the Soviet sector of East Berlin. The tension during the examination room scenes are the highlight of the film with both Rachel and the doctor verbally maneuvering to ensure the other person is who they think they are.After a convincing action sequence, the story abruptly turns from a kidnap/escape scenario into a hostage situation. This is one of the points where the film just falls apart. Mossad and their agents are the best in the entire world at their art. There is no way such highly trained agents would fall victim to and resort to the amateur hour theatrics which come with the hostage sequence. The script is riddled with illogical and bizarre events which only occur during the film's most important sequences for some reason.Fast forward to 1997 and now older Rachel (Helen Mirren) is at her daughter's book release party which describes the team's successful mission to Berlin all those years ago. Older Stephen (Tom Wilkinson) is also around for the recollections. The 1997 scenes are adeptly written and filmed, especially scenes with Mirren. Tom Wilkerson is just along for the ride. Unfortunately, the movie's climax is one of the most preposterous situations a decent film has been saddled with. It is so ridiculous that a two hour meeting with the writers would still not convince me this was the best way to resolve the story's actions and issues. The mood and atmosphere are destroyed and the audience collectively shook their heads in disbelief at the mockery on screen.Screenwriters Matthew Vaughn, Jane Goldman (X-Men: First Class, Kick-Ass), and Peter Straughan (The Men Who Stare at Goats) adapted this screenplay from an earlier film. The Debt's first hour is quite good with adept flow from 1997 to 1966 and the truly suspenseful scenes between Chastain and Christensen. However, their handling of the hostage situation and the absurd climax are what really hurt this film and makes the audience shake their heads with the 'Oh, what might have been' lament.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc1MmRjNGQtN2I4Mi00NWJiLThlNDEtNWFiNGZkZjlmNDE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzI1NzMxNzM@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Those people need to loosen up and get ""just the facts.""  Maybe I see more of the humor because I am a law enforcement officer, but this film is a scream.  It takes everything that the original series did, and does it with tongue firmly planted in cheek.  Dan Ackroyd's deadpan Jack Webb impersonation is a riot, as are the remarks he makes to Hanks' Pep Streebeck.  A typical example would be after Joe ignores Sylvia Wiss' advances, and Pep calls him on it.  Joe looks him dead in the eye and says, ""Streebeck, there are two things that separate us from the animals.  One, we use cutlery.  Two, we can control our sexual urges.  I don't know about you, but don't drag ME into your private HELL!""  That line is so Jack Webb-DRAGNET that I'm surprised it never showed up in the 1960's version.

There are holes in the plot all over the place and some things just don't make sense at all. If you are after a well constructed storyline then move on and keep looking. However, if you are a red blooded male like myself and can overlook the many flaws in this movie and love action movies, then this is worth a watch. The numerous death scenes are great and Salma spends the movie showing off her fantastic body and thats a win win for all of us.

This is a Leslie Nielsen-type silly parody, except the late Lloyd Bridges played the lead role instead Nielson.Actually Jay Mohr was more of the lead actor in here, narrating the film and taking Al Pacino's Godfather role while Christina Applegate took Diane Keaton's character. There are a number of laugh-out-loud lines in this movie and a number of overdone slapstick scenes. As with any comedy in which the material comes at you at a rapid pace (see the Marx Brothers films from 70 years ago to see some of the origins of comedic mayhem), you get a lot funny and not-so-funny. They come at you so fast you can hardly keep up. I found that there were a lot of funny lines written on background buildings, street signs, etc. on this film. You almost have to freeze-frame some scenes to ""read"" all the jokes, much less hear them.This movie did do something that Hollywood films rarely have done: poke fun at a Democrat. Usually, the cheap shots are reserved for Republcians (Nixon, Gingrich, Reagan, Bush, etc) but here we have the famous ""But I never had sex with that woman!"" line delivered in a obvious reference. Well, good for them. About time the Liberals were recipients of a cheap shot or two. It only happens about once every 25 years in films. So, I give this film points for being ""fair and balanced.""Also points should be awarded for having several actors from the actual Godfather films make appearances here, too. The film was dedicated ""in loving memory"" to Bridges, so I assume this was his last movie.

A chance encounter leads him to discover an enlightened way ahead.","185","The first spiritually oriented movie that really works!","I was invited to a screening of The Peaceful Warrior in NYC Thursday April 13th, having just learned of this film's existence a few days earlier.I was looking forward to the film, but with some trepidation, considering that prior attempts at communicating spiritually oriented books or ideas had fallen short of my expectations and had fundamentally failed to convey to the audience a transforming inner experience; witness What the Bleep, Siddhartha, Little Buddha, and others.Let me say this, simply and directly. They got it right this time, and they did it in a way which could be embraced by crowds at the multiplexes. By impressing the discovery of bona fide spiritual truths on a recognizable sports template, the movie makers will be carrying under-appreciated ideas and experiences to the masses. At least I hope so! I actually woke up early the morning after seeing this, with my mind full of things I might say in an exhaustive review. Never in my life have I felt that way about a movie before.The reason this movie succeeds is that it follows one of the most basic rules for good story-telling: it shows rather than tells. Although some fundamental spiritual ideas are described with words, it is the plot and character development that proves the truth of those words. You see the transcendence and the realizations in the faces of the characters, and you are not left to wonder why. You understand.The story, based on a book by Dan Millman, follows a college gymnast who has great potential but whose desire for success is one of the main obstacles standing in the way of that potential. In his mindless pursuit of a goal, he becomes sucked into the deep dark hole of life-is-what-happens-while-you're-making-other-plans. In its simplest message, our hero's real challenge is to find happiness by being present and finding interest and love for what's right in front of him.The film doesn't try to oversimplify the content of a spiritual path into a single dogma; there are many other seeds of thought strewn along the path by Socrates, each of which could have been the basis for a different struggle to transcend relative unconsciousness.For many years I have been convinced that non-religious spiritual thought and experience could be something to drive the world in a new direction. This movie provides an example of what life can be like if we ponder these thoughts and implement them in our lives in a concrete and practical way. It's not necessary to be a champion gymnast to derive the fundamental teachings from this film. It is a teaching that anyone can understand. This is why I see that The Peaceful Warrior can inspire those who embrace the possibilities which it offers to become peaceful guerrilla warriors, working tirelessly underneath the radar, changing the world.This is not only a good movie, it's an important one.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTNmMzU1YTMtMzU3OS00MmMzLWJmMTUtOThhYTE0ZjEyMGQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUyNjc3NDQ4._V1_UY209_CR8,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

He moves there with Rebecca (Lisa Pelikan), and soon after begins acting strangely, instinctively following his father's footsteps.If you're a fan of campy, cheesy horror films, as I am, Ghoulies is a must see. Everyone else should probably avoid this film. This is a Charles Band production. Charles Band means Empire/Full Moon, and Empire/Full Moon is almost a guarantee of some campiness/cheesiness. Not many of Band's films, however, approach the sublime ridiculousness of Ghoulies. We're almost in Troma territory here, but Ghoulies is played much more seriously than the typical Troma production, and in this case, it works to increase the entertainment value.Since Ghoulies was made in 1984, it features most of the mid-80s horror film clichÃÂ©s. Shortly after moving in, Graves throws a party, so we get big hair, tight miniskirts, skinny ties, recreational drug use, and so on. We also get our eventual fodder for our body count, although in this case, it is worth noting that writer/director Luca Bercovici introduces a ""twist"" near the end that significantly decreases the body count.Liapis is the focus of the film, though, and without him, Ghoulies might be more boring than campy. His absurd overacting, often in solo scenes, takes up a majority of screen time. Still, just the brief presence of two demonic minions, Grizzel and Greedigut, would alone make Ghoulies a must see, especially given how everyone continues their attempt to play the film seriously when they appear. And I haven't even mentioned the other ridiculous minions, which are obviously puppets and ""dead props"" (Band seems to love puppets), and were the beginning of a horror industry attempt to cash in on the success of Gremlins (also seen later in such films as the Critters series and Munchies). We also get zombies, a Star Wars-like battle of wizards, sunglasses as a major plot device, an evil doll, an attack with a 5 foot long tongue, and some probably unintentional homoerotic subtext. Who could pass all of that up? The film gets a 7 out of 10 from me--an 8 out of 10 would have been in order, except for the inexplicable absence of gratuitous nudity.Note that while Ghoulies is tagged ""comedy/horror"", it's very unlikely that it was intended to be a comedy in any way. Even if Band applied the label to the film prior to release, it was probably because even he realized how ludicrous the film turned out. At any rate, it would be misguided to watch it expecting intentional humor.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjIzMzhiOTAtNWM0Yy00MGQ4LWJhNDEtMzUzMjY4OTgyYWM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The film bears some similarities to the verite approach of Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song but is infinitely superior to that movie in the storytelling department. Based on Carson's autobiography, the title character (played with absolute conviction by Rony Clanton) is a bright young man who gets sucked into gang turf warfare that ends with him doing time in the slammer. There are good supporting performances by B.T. Taylor as fellow Lord, Crazy, and Joyce Walker as Sonny's girlfriend Virginia, whose addiction to heroin ultimately turns Carson's life around. The location footage in Bedford-Stuyvesant is excellent, and the battle between the Lords and the Hawks anticipates similar scenes in The Warriors and the Wanderers (both 1979).","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjY0ZjlmODUtZjM3Ni00OWY0LWIxZGItZjIyYzMxMjFjNDlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I urge everyone to get this DVD either by sending your three coupons to the promotion or by dealing with someone in the province of QuÃÂ©bec since it appears to be the only place in North America where this contest is void and one can buy it directly off the shelf.I have heard about 'Sunrise' all my life but the closest I ever got to see a part of it was, as a quote, in Martin Scorsese's 2-DVD made-for-the-BBC lecture with illustrations 'A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies' (1995). Nobody told me the following:It is a pioneering, overwhelming piece of cinema that still manages to move me (ME!) after I thought I had seen everything. It is a profoundly human film which made me cry for 15 minutes solid in its first part (a reconciliation scene that has to be seen to be believed). This film has more special effects than Terminator 3, all in the service of a thoroughly poetic, bucolic, pastoral, personal, contemplative, idiosyncratic, lyrical, late romantic and expressionist vision of humanity. Its love story, poignant and comic elements have inspired, in no specific order, RenÃÂ© Clair ('Le Million'), Jean Vigo ('L'Atalante', 'ZÃÂ©ro de conduite'), Charlie Chaplin (all his subsequent films), Fellini ('La Strada', 'Nights of Cabiria') and even James Cameron ('Titanic').The camera is extremely mobile (more so than in most of today's films, except maybe The Matrix) and the acting is superb. I finally understand why Janet Gaynor was such a big star and a big deal in her time. Her co-star George O'Brien would be hunk-o-rama of the month at the box office today if he was still around. Margaret Livingston (who she?) is also quite realistic as a believably enticing city girl vamp (of modest means) who tries to lure the hero away from his deserving wife.The DVD has more extras than a Criterion issue, including a tentative reconstruction of Murnau's missing American masterpiece 'The Four Devils' (a circus love story) and the entire shooting scripts of both 'Sunrise' and 'The Four Devils'.'Sunrise' is presented with two soundtracks: the original (mono) Movietone (i.e. optical track) anonymous composite soundtrack cobbled together from several sources (think Wagner's Siegfried Idyll) and a newly written and recorded (stereo) score with all-original themes, that closely follows the original in spirit but not in melody.Both soundtracks try to add an intimate, poetic dimension to the film, which is subtitled 'A Song of Two Humans'. The music is an integral part of the experience as the film is conceived as a tone poem and, as such (my theory) is a kind of transcription for the masses of Schoenberg's 1900 string ensemble tone poem 'VerklÃÂ¤rte Nacht' (Transfigured Night), a late-Romantic/early expressionist attempt to describe musically the 'truly profound and authentic' relationship between a man and a woman who have problems (the music follows a poem of the era).Both soundtracks succeed admirably, my preference going to the new one, despite the original's polish, historical value and magnificent preservation. And that would be because, although in the silent era there was no stigma attached to accompanying silent movies with a score made up of public domain and rather recognizable pieces, as long as they fit the mood, times have changed ('2001, A Space Odyssey' notwithstanding) and this practice is more distracting than anything for a contemporary, moderately educated spectator.Murnau had very highbrow ambitions but his film is totally clear and populist and made to reach the widest popular audience thanks to the incredible sums of money and artistry that Fox poured in the project. 20th Century Fox basically imported a genius from Germany, gave him a ton of money and told him: 'Make us a movie that will be the most prestigious ever made in this town and that will win us the first Oscar'. And that's just what he did!Needless to say, that was a long time before Rupert Murdoch took over the Fox Corporation...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDVkYmYwM2ItNzRiMy00NWQ4LTlhMjMtNDI1ZDYyOGVmMzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTgzMzU5MDI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

We were 21 at the time and lived about an hour and half from The Disney Studio in Burbank and the Hollywood, California area.  We grew up in front of the TV and probably some of the first generation of latch-key-kids.  Twenty years later, we still have lots of fun and are still 'heavy' or what ever is politically correct these days.  We don't pursue acting any more but have been know to 'come back' when the right opportunity arrives.  Carol is a Chiropractor in our home town of Southern California and I am in the Information Technology field in Georgia.I maybe bias, but I thought the film was cute, clean and fun.  We knew it wasn't a master piece or an Oscar nominee, however, it was and still is a movie the whole family can watch and have fun together.  It's nice not to have to worry if your young children can watch a video without having to fast forward certain parts.  And no one was more exited when it was released on video as Carol and I were.

I can't possibly agree with the individual who wrote this was possibly James Garner's worst movie. The exact opposite is true. The character of Charlie is callous, and self-serving, but he has a dedication to the admiral that is logical and touching. It is the admiral, after all, who saved Charlie from the realities of war.Listen to Charlie's speech about how he got there. He started off by going to war with all the ideals of any other Marine, but in the teeth of war he realized he wasn't the man he thought he was and ""the glory"" certainly wasn't worth it. Charlie is a coward, but not a deserter. He has priorities, which he lists to Emily. Garner does a fine job in communicating the role of an outwardly selfish and uncaring man struggling hard to suppress his principles.Julie Andrews' Emily is just the person to bring those principles out. And James Coburn is outstanding as the one person who actually takes the admiral's plan for a sailor to be the first casualty on Omaha Beach seriously. Very good acting by all. Fine comic performances in a film that is easily overlooked by today's audiences because it isn't the type of humor that hits you over the head with a baseball bat to make its point. Instead, it uses characterization and intelligence.How sad we are that we are no longer required to think about movies, since so many of them have no thought behind them other than making money.

Though the film has been characterized as ""bleak,"" the feeling tone is more like sadness and regret that many today have lost the capacity for compassion and empathy. Accompanied by Evgeny Galperin's rich cascading piano score, the film opens as cinematographer Mikhail Krichman surrounds us with the quiet beauty of a Russian winter.Almost immediately, we are staring at an cold-looking stone building that could easily be a prison in Siberia. There is no sound or movement. Suddenly a door opens and children, released from school, swarm through its exits. Though some are laughing, it is not a happy scene. 12-year-old Aloysha (Matvey Novikov) makes his way home through a barren forest but there are no warm greetings awaiting him. The marriage between his mother, beauty-salon owner Zhenya (Maryana Spivak) and his father Boris (Alexey Rozin, ""Leviathan""), a desk-ridden management functionary, is over. Seeking status, money, and freedom, both are immersed in new relationships. Boris is with the pregnant Masha (Marina Vasilyeva, ""Name Me"") and Zhenya with the well-to-do business executive Anton (Andris Keishs, ""What Nobody Can See"").Though their apartment has been advertised for sale and their divorce is in its final stages, custody of Alyosha has not yet been agreed upon. It is clear that he is an unwanted child, the result of an unexpected pregnancy and a marriage of convenience. Like emotionless machines, the warring couple continue their repetitive spiral of mutual recrimination as Alyosha crouches behind the bathroom door. Fearful and alone he absorbs every last ounce of malice, his face becoming contorted into a mass of silent tears that well up from deep within his being. It is a shocking scene that mirrors every despair the world has ever known.Since the film takes place in the year 2012, talk radio focuses on the Mayan calendar and its apocalyptic date in December. News reports tell us about the bloody war in the Ukraine. Amidst the barely-controlled paranoia in the air, Boris tells a co-worker that he is afraid to lose his job if his boss, a fundamentalist Christian, finds out about his impending divorce. Fear of losing his job becomes secondary, however, when Zhenya tells him that Alyosha has not shown up for school for two days and is now missing. Far from coming together to patch up their differences, however, the estranged couple only double-down on their mutual acrimony.The inefficient police offer little expectation that they can find the boy and try to reassure the parents that, in most cases, a missing child is with a friend or relative or out on an adventure and will soon return home. Not satisfied with officialdom's inertia, they turn to a volunteer group who put up posters, talk to teachers and neighbors. An interview with Alyosha's only friend points them to an abandoned apartment in the middle of a forest. In a scene of eerie darkness where there is a palpable feeling of hopelessness and loss, the rescuers, wearing bright orange jackets, comb every space in the decrepit building but Alyosha is not found.A boy matching Alyosha's description is found at a nearby hospital but it is not him, and a subsequent visit to the morgue only offers more tears. Taking a risk, the two visit Alyosha's mother but the visit only succeeds in bringing hatred up to a level of ecstasy. With no explanation in sight, Zvyagintsev teases us with the sight of an unknown man walking alone into the forest, a man hidden from the camera in a fancy restaurant asking a call girl for her phone number which she provides while looking directly into the camera, a man pausing at a bus stop to read the flier about the missing boy, then turning and walking away, and a teacher cleaning her blackboard after students have left.These tantalizing scenes, however, do not bring us any closer to a solution to the mystery of Alyosha's disappearance. Loveless is a deeply disturbing film that explores the dark places of human behavior, upending our most cherished beliefs about the bond between parents and children. Making it clear about what can happen when an unwanted child is brought into the world, Anton tells Zhenya that no one can survive a life without love. If Loveless serves as any kind of warning, it may be to help us discover that the world cannot survive either unless we begin to re-envision it as sacred.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU3ODQ3MzQ5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDQwMDIzNDM@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"
"Up!","","","80.0","Comedy, Mystery, Thriller","5.8","","Russ Meyer","Edward Schaaf, Robert McLane, Elaine Collins, Candy Samples","3,201","It begins with the murder of one Adolf Schwartz--who bears a striking resemblance to another famous Adolf--via a ravenous piranha fish in his bathtub.","19","A characteristically incoherent and outrageous dark comedy from Russ Meyer","During the 1970's Russ Meyer established a reputation for producing low budget movies exploiting violence and nudity which were very successful as midnight features in conventional cinemas, or at drive in cinemas.  They established a recognisable genre which usually followed a similar template and made a Russ Meyer film very easy to recognise. Now that these films have reappeared on DVD's for home viewing, and are being featured on some TV channels, interest in them may be reviving. Their most characteristic feature is one or more very violent sequences in which characters who have received what should clearly be fatal wounds, pull themselves together and continue to cut themselves to pieces until even the director has been satisfied. Another almost universal feature is a cast that includes several very generously endowed young women who are not adverse to displaying their natural assets unwrapped. Other common features in Russ Meyer films are (1) great photography of a variety of exceptionally scenic locations (to my mind this is often the most attractive feature of his work), (2) a naked siren or spirit who watches over the proceedings, and periodically comments on them in a moralistic way, (3) a corrupt law enforcement officer with a voracious sexual appetite who eventually meets a ""just"" death, (4) a script which ultimately delivers violent death to all those characters that Meyer regards as completely antisocial (these include all homosexuals, anyone associated with the drug trade, and any Nazi supporters who have survived World War II), and (5) some sort of postscript that summarises the lessons which we are expected to have learned from the film that we have been viewing. ""Up"" was released in 1976 and is I believe the best, (or the worst - according to ones point of view), of the films of this genre he produced.Such a film could not be easily imitated today, it dates from a time when the augmentation of mammaries was not usually practiced, so the fairly vigorous movements Russ required from his cast always led to very pronounced ""bouncing boobs"". Today most of the starlets who compete to participate in movies that feature their bare breasts, have had silicone implants which lead to a very different physical response. Whilst most of Russ's films feature such starlets in the cast, ""Up!"" may be the first where Russ recognised that these unusually well developed mammaries are often associated with an unusually generous pubic thatch, and also made a great effort to pay his photographic respects to this characteristic. Clearly the primary focus in the selection of the cast for this film was not acting ability, and too much should not be expected in this area. Nevertheless Raven de la Croix has an extremely expressive face which, when compared with some other Russ Meyer films, minimises any deficiencies in this respect. This film also features all the other characteristics of his work listed above. The naked spirit who provides a periodic commentary is playfully portrayed by Kitten Natividad, who has a role listed as the Greek chorus and whose comments are frequently delightfully pretentious. Gory violence is perpetrated with an axe and a chainsaw, both of which appear to have been chosen by the characters concerned in preference to the firearm that they could also have used. This scene would be completely intolerable to view were it not filmed with such extreme hyperbole that it is reduced to the level of black comedy. ""Up!"" also features the ultimate in surviving Nazi supporters - Adolph Hitler himself, together with his daughter by Eva Braun, who in some way appear to have escaped from the bunker in Berlin and taken up residence in California. The story, such as it is, starts with the murder of Adolph and follows the search for his assassin. Continued flashbacks make it difficult to follow, but this film is comedy rather than drama, and anyone viewing it today will be watching it for the visual effects (including both the types of spectacular natural scenery so generously featured), rather than the story line.A good review should help its reader to decide whether they would regard the film as worth watching. With ""Up!"" this is simple, if you are a fan of Russ Meyer but do not know this film, you should certainly, in my opinion, accept any opportunity to see it because it is a more mature production than many of those which preceded it. If you have not seen any of his films but are anxious to sample one of them in order to assess why they have become cult favourites, I would recommend ""Up!"" because it is very characteristic of, but less extravagantly presented than, many of his earlier works. If you are one of those to whom Meyer's somewhat incoherent films will not appeal, the information above should be sufficient to save you from investing valuable time watching it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmJlNTU2MjctZDc4NC00ZDc4LTlkNTAtM2Q0Mjg2NzZiNzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjQ5NzM@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

"The Country Girl","","","104.0","Drama, Music","7.2","","George Seaton","Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, William Holden, Anthony Ross","6,683","A director hires an alcoholic has-been and strikes up a stormy relationship with the actor's wife, who he believes is the cause of all the man's problems.","55","Incredible Highs.","Bing Crosby's career reached its dramatic heights in The Country Girl. In fact the trio of Crosby, Grace Kelly, and William Holden all hit incredible highs with this one. Clifford Odets's play was a good backstage drama without any great political statement that characterized his earlier work It would be another three years before Bing Crosby would do a film without singing at all. But for those who've never seen the Odets play, the story is one without any music. Crosby's role on Broadway was originated by Paul Kelly. When Paramount bought the screen rights they had Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin write the songs that Crosby sings in The Country Girl. Curiously enough none of them, good that they were, became any kind of hit for Bing. Also this was Ira Gershwin's last score for either the stage of screen.It's fitting that Grace Kelly won her Oscar for this part. Uta Hagen who played Georgie Elgin on Broadway won a Tony for her performance. Kelly was up against some stiff competition that year and upset the betting favorite Judy Garland for A Star Is Born. Other nominees included Dorothy Dandridge for Carmen Jones, Jane Wyman for Magnificent Obsession and Audrey Hepburn for Sabrina. I suppose it was the fact that Kelly was cast against type in her portrayal. Usually playing chic blonde princesses, she's almost dowdy looking in this film.Crosby plumbed some dramatic depths also and was nominated for Frank Elgin. However after three successive years of being nominated and not winning, Marlon Brando was not going to be denied in 1954. The rest of that field included Humphrey Bogart for The Caine Mutiny, James Mason for A Star Is Born and Dan O'Herlihy for Robinson Crusoe. Not a shabby field there either and Crosby's personal best came up against Brando's consolation for not winning for Streetcar Named Desire. Oscar politics at its finest.Bill Holden's part of Bernie Dodd was originated on Broadway by Steven Hill who today's audiences know as DA Adam Schiff from Law and Order. After years of playing what he called ""Smiling Jim"" roles, his acting took on some bite with Sunset Boulevard. He's a cynical man here also, but there was an additional edge here. One of the plot elements was alcoholic Crosby knowing about Holden's bad marriage and using that knowledge to blame his bad behavior on Kelly. Holden was in the midst of a bad marriage himself, the only one he ever had. Marked by bitterness, recriminations, and mutual infidelities, he and Brenda Marshall stayed married for over 20 years for the sake of their children. When Holden's Bernie Dodd talks about his former wife there's an edge that I'm sure came from personal experience.The only other role of any size is that of producer Phil Cook and it's played Anthony Ross. Another plot element is Holden's championing Crosby going head to head a few times with Ross who never really wanted him in his show. One of Ross's condition to using Crosby is that he given a contract with a two weeks notice clause and not a run of the play contract. Ross gets hoisted on his own petard for that one. Sadly this was Ross's last film, he died the following year.The Country Girl is mature and intelligent and avoids the usual Hollywood clichÃÂ©s concerning show business stories. Even if you're not a fan of any or all of its three stars, this can be enjoyed on its artistic merits.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTdjODFiZTItOGRkMS00YzNkLWJhNzMtMzBmZTQzMmNmYTJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I saw it in a packed theater at the Sundance film festival and I've never heard louder applause from an audience. I would recommend watching the first film, just because its also very good and introduces all the characters. However, this film stands on its own. The director sought to make this stand out from the first film and he succeeded. This has fantastic action, great dialogue, and some hilarious dark humor. But most of all, its intelligent, its extremely well made, it's not plagued with any awkward or out of place moments. For some viewers, this film might actually be a learning experience.

If I had encountered this Korean version first I most likely would have liked it better, but since this was not the case it was impossible to not do a comparison in my mind as I watched it and found it quite wanting. The Japanese version is superior in every regard, acting, direction, cinematography, and the writing.Although several minutes longer than the original, this version has a simplified story line and really doesn't develop any secondary characters much except a new one, an over-the-top comic uncle. Actually, although there were a few comic moments in the original they came about naturally and were at times subtle. This was especially the case in the comparison of the accounts of the leading characters when they encountered each other at school. In this new one the comedy is anything but subtle and is at times essentially slapstick. The young Woo-jin character is made so much a clumsy nerd that in some scenes he belongs more in a Three Stooges comedy. In the original his social awkwardness stems more from his coping with illness. His illness is central to the plot, but with the exception of a moment or two in this new version, the illness seems barely present at all leaving motivations that drive decisions illogical and not natural.The secondary characters such as the wise doctor, a caring co-worker, a baker, and the teacher at school all added considerable richness in the Japanese film that is sorely lacking in this one.I am tempted to say that the director is inept, but I think perhaps it is more fair to say that his approach in this movie is awkward and lacking in style. He doesn't manage to introduce much depth to the story or characters so ultimately his version is far less touching than the original. A key scene at the end of the rainy season is now barely there, but was an emotional highlight in the Japanese film. The characters are far more believable in the first film, the remake failing to come close in comparison. I think the actors, director, and screenwriter share blame for this. In particular I found Ye-jin Son's performance flat and not conveying the emotional core necessary to make her character's choices make sense and carry impact. I am tempted to think she was only cast because of her being cute and having a stunning figure.The Japanese film took advantage of interesting location shooting, in a field of sunflowers and at a local festival. The cultural touches added richness and provided a nice backdrop to the scenes, adding visual interest as well. The Korean version is shot in a ""matter of fact"" style they could be in virtually any number of places.In conclusion the original is far better nuanced, making it far more believable, involving, and touching. In watching this new one I found a tear or two coming to my eyes, but realized these were coming due to remembering the same scene in the original film, not the one I was watching. For those who have not seen either movie I would suggest seeking out the Japanese version first. For those who liked the Korean version I strongly recommend watching the first version as it most likely will deliver what was liked in this one, but in an even greater measure.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGVkZjdlMzAtNGFjZi00Zjc1LTljZmQtYjEzYjFjMjkxNDk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDcyMjQ4MzU@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In Children of a Lesser God the love is so simple, and the conflict so believable, that it feels less like watching a movie, and more like watching friends walk through their own personal story.  The attraction between Matlin and Hurt is obvious, but genuine, and is filled with the kind of ""touches"" that make it feel real. It is also a visually beautiful film.  Each shot is set like a still photographer capturing an image.  The overwhelming beauty of the New Brunswick coast creates a background for the film that leaves one with the feeling of watching a moving painting. Matlin has unfortunately not since been offered anything near this piece in which to display her amazing talent.  It is a shame that a woman who could stand alongside Katherine Hepburn and Jodie Foster as all time great actresses is not having the opportunity to display that talent because of her hearing disability.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ2MzY5NGMtMWU0Ny00ZDQ5LTgwOTUtYTUwYjVhNWFhMzc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It doesn't have the power and allegorical elements of the original,yet it doesn't go into outright camp like many of the sequels. The film is colourful,exciting and often witty,yet the fantastical story is handled relatively seriously.The plot is strong and,within the demands of a Japanese monster movie,logical. The human characters are mostly reasonably interesting and we don't mind spending time with them for the first half hour or so until the monsters show up. The effects are excellent considering the budget-the constant criticism of the effects in these films is sometimes valid but certainly not here. The two monster battle scenes are shorter then usual but exciting and amusing without being completely comical. Godzilla is at his most fearsome in this film,and he even threatens children,while the graceful,mystical Mothra is a great adversary. Akira Ifikube's music is thrilling {if repetitive}and there are even important issues such as the destruction of the environment and the evils of big business put into the film without spoiling the fun.Some other Godzilla films may be more funnier,or more exciting,or more spectacular,or whatever,but Godzilla Vs Mothra may well be the artistic peak of the series,with all the elements woven into an immensely satisfying whole,and,unusually for a Japanese sci-fi movie of the time,it was not altered much for it's US version,with only some minor cuts,not-too-bad dubbing and,best of all, the addition of a scene featuring Godzilla!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjBkNjk0NDAtNDcxYy00NDI3LThjM2QtYjRhOTY1NmM0N2NhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

(1990) was another sequel. During the 80's any movie that made the slightest of profits made a sequel. For one reason only, to make even more money. However many producers never made another dime off of the momentum of the previous film and were stuck with a sequel that cost two or three times as much as the original film, Another 48 Hrs. was a prime example. The only reason films that produced multiple sequels raked in the dough was the films were cheaply made, low overhead means more potential for a profit. When you pour millions into a movie and expect to make a buck, two out of three times you're going to lose your shirt. The movie has a ""rushed into production"" feel. I felt the same way after watching Scary Movie 2. The director was given what he had to work with. I can't fault Walter Hill because he made a pretty watchable movie. The problem was this film didn't need a sequel. The end results are a remake of the first movie. No more, no less. This film was made during the peak of Eddie Murphy's over exposure period. Like so many actors, he was a victim of his own excess. Nick Nolte seemed to be going through the motions whilst Eddie Murphy had that ""look at me"" thing going.Overall it's not a bad movie.

It is one of the most completely, openly joyful films I have ever seen. In many ways a totally Western film, it is yet completely un-Western, and absolutely invigorating.I found the (rather oddly looped in places) mix of Hindi and English dialog to be a lot of fun to follow (as incomplete as the subtitles sometimes seemed). The Indian/Western pop structure of the songs was entertaining and infectious. The choreography is simply amazing, and some of the most sheerly athletic I've seen. The Indian roots of the dance routines were at first almost unnerving--at once familiar yet bizarre, almost surreal (to my Western eyes). It was sheer fun making the cultural adjustment.The plot is predictable, almost pedestrian--certainly not what you'd call ""never done before,"" and yet I found myself completely absorbed in the story, and rooting for the main characters. This is in large part due to Shahrukh Khan's and Kajol's performances as Raj and Simran. He is totally endearing, and she is totally hot!, and their on screen chemistry is as cute & perky and smoldering & steamy as Fred and Ginger at their peak. It was, simply put, fun to watch them having so much fun.Director Aditya Chopra was, I understand, only 24 when he made Dilwale, and the film was so successful its Indian first run lasted a world-record 11 years (and may still be going on, as far as I know). A heckuva testimony to Bollywood indeed. This movie has instantly become one of my favorite musicals, and I look forward to finding more films from Chopra, Khan, and Kajol.

Directed by 27 year old Greg Marcks, the film is populated by up and coming young stars including Colin Hanks and Rachael Leigh Cook.  It's actually 5 stories that all take place in a small town in middle America at around 11pm on a random night.Characters keep running into each other and bad bad things happen, but the stories are all strung together in really clever, often darkly funny ways. The dialog is sharp and real, and Marcks has a real skill with his young cast. There are some really excellent performances, especially by Rachael Leigh Cook, who as the trashy Cherie is just the right combination of evil and desperate.Although even in her trailer park costume she's breathtakingly beautiful! Also look for Ben Foster, who surprised me with a very realistic performance, after something REALLY bad happens to him.  Hanks is also good, as is Shawn Hatosy.  I was blown away!

I was in a packed theater and there was hardly any laughing going on at all - that is a very bad thing. Laughter is contagious, but not in this film!The voice acting was average at best, although Owen Wilson was good, but one turkey cannot carry an entire movie, especially when the plot was so lame.The animation itself was OK, but without a decent story and characterizations, a movie is going to fail, and this one did big time! We didn't expect factually accurate obviously, you'd have to be crazy to think it was, but we were hoping the humans wouldn't be portrayed as either total morons OR really evil and vicious.

Its got a soap opera plot pasted on to some really fine cinematography, editing, music and racing sequences. The real stars of this film are the cars, the beautiful F1 'cigar' cars of the 60's with their exposed engines and elegant lines. Within a handful of years aerodynamics and advertising would change the look of racing forever. Even the plot hints at the change taking place at the time-- from the gentlemen's league of the 50's to the ravenously commercial and brutally competitive environment that Formula 1 was to become. Frankenheimer followed the tour through a season, to the storied old tracks such as Nurburgring, Spa and Monza (before safety and television considerations changed them to much shorter, less idiosyncratic shadows of their former selves). There are cameos by Graham Hill,  Bruce McLaren, Jim Clark and Lorenzo Bandini, names tinged with tragedy in retrospect. Technically this film is quite an achievement. Many of its developments, however, did not really take, such a multiple images, and the splicing of soft music to intense action scenes. The film, then, is not one of great importance in movie history.

When we finished the movie, the audience was happy and we were happy, this was a fun and cute movie. So I have to say that I am very very surprised by this harsh rating on IMDb, I mean, a 4.4?! You have got to be kidding me, this is by no means movie of the year, but for what it was, this was just a fun comedy to watch. There wasn't any major problems with this movie that deserves that kind of a rating that makes it look like the first major flop of the year. Diane Keaton, Queen Latifah, and Katie Holmes were absolutely adorable together and had great chemistry. They made the story an Oceans Eleven for the girls, sounds like such a chick flick, but I think this is one that most could actually enjoy.Bridget and her husband, Dan are in major debt, really bad debt, like 282,000 dollars in debt. They are about to loose everything they own, so Bridget gets a job as a janitor for the financial bank. When she notices the ultimate torture of how they shred worn out money, she gets a clever idea with the help of two other girl employees, Nina and Jackie, to find a way to break the system and get that money to get out of their poor situations. Once they get what they need, Bridget is so satisfied with how smooth everything went, she wants more and they go for it, but they should learn not to get so greedy since someone is on their tale.Mad Money is a chick flick, but it's one of the rare one's that I liked. I didn't think there was anything wrong with this film. I think they could have explained the situation with the boss of the bank a little better, I don't know if he was in on it or what, but it's something that could slide I think. Queen Latifah was just so funny and Diane Keaton was a perfect choice for Bridget, Katie Holmes was pretty decent for the comic relief. Please don't take the rating on IMDb seriously, I think that Mad Money was just a fun little comedy that deserves a better chance.6/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMTY2NTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg3NzczMw@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In this particular film, he gave us one of his best comedy-stilish acting (""no-one noticed it"", he said) which makes this movie working. Burt's acting would be enough to make it watchable, but also Ossie Davis and Clint Walker fit well in their roles.For me the remarkable of this movie is a) the way it is directed and edited (it ain't dull for one second), although there are some silly situations (e.g. Burt firing with a machine gun to save his friends killing all his enemies without hitting his friends...), but hey, it's a comedy and it's not the story which is most interesting. It's the mood of the film and the way characters are portrayed. It contains a lot of fine jokes and dialogue (""I'm not riding this long way to bury your bird"") and chemistry between Burt and Angie Dickinson is amazing. Also the more serious parts of the film (stealing the gold out of the fort) are working well.Also, there are some things which seem to be rare in a film: The fact that no-one of the ""thieves"" have intentions killing his buddies to keep the gold for himself. No, they even break in to return it back to the government! It's hardly believable, but it is that fact that make the film and these characters charming.I give it a 7 of 10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM4NDVmZDItYzU3Zi00ZTY4LWIwZmItZDA0MWNhMTNlNTg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I don't care if we revisit Boys or Girls state, I just need more! I LOVED Boys State from 2020, and so when I discovered this was coming, I instantly added it to the watchlist. Furthermore, when I learned earlier that it was released today I knew right away what I'd be watching tonight.Girls State has many similarities to Boys State but many differences! For the most part, I felt like it was pretty neutral to politics. You get a good mix of girls from both political platforms, I do think the documentary leans a little more left, but I think that's also just the nature of the movie industry in general. One thing I've found to love about these docs though is regardless of the person's political affiliation, I'm always so invested in their story!This one really had me invested in Emily and Nisha, though there wasn't one girl I disliked following. The doc points out a lot of problems with gender inequality and does it in a way that doesn't put down either gender, but acknowledges the issue and looks to the future of women leadership optimistically.There are female-empowerment speeches that were better than anything you'd hear in the Barbie movie, and they're literally from high schoolers. I may not have agreed with every topic discussed, but just like Boys State, I was glued to my screen from the start. Please seek both these documentaries out!!!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJhMDNkMjEtNDhiNy00NWEyLWFmYzEtNzI4YTAwODdlODU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzOTczNzYx._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

As a writer, he is often excellent with creative twists and turns for every story. As a director, he is often sloppy and mostly leaves you disappointed, thinking that a great opportunity has been lost. In his movies major characters disappear without explaination and whole chunks of plot often seem to be missing. All the while you are thinking ""what a shame on such a good story!"". To my surprise, I found that ""Ambulance"" actually is held together quite neatly. No chop-chop editing this time. The plot runs amok here and there, but not damagingly so. It is amusing and suspenseful with spunky performances by Gallagher and Roberts and a really good one by Red Buttons. Some effort have been put into the action sequences and interiors.

For an international (Irish) low budget indie film, it was better than some recent big budget Hollywood blockbusters I've seen lately. The cinematography by James Mather was outstanding, and even made basic inexpensive sets feel like that post-apocalyptic grungy future one would expect.The 98 min runtime felt a little long with the slow pacing and progression of the story. The writing by Bryan Edward Hill had some plot and technical issues with some convoluted dialogue, and the screenplay could've used some tweaking by a seasoned writer. Had the film been cut down to about 85 mins with faster pacing, and/or had more grit and suspense with a little more character development, this could've been a cult classic.The score I found to be excellent, especially for a B grade film. It was fitting, and certainly set the look and feel of the film appropriately. The performances were great by all, especially Fimmel, but I felt Pearce's character could've used more expression and energy.Overall I did enjoy this better than I expected.

I'm giving it a high rating, so go ahead and be a troll and give me a thumbs down and tell me my review isn't helpful because yall don't agree with me.When I saw the trailer, I did roll my eyes and didn't care much for the kid, but when I watched it, he grew on me a little bit. This new installment in the Home Alone series (We're up to the 6th one now) is a LOT better then the previous two films, but it's still not as good as the original. To me, this feels like the true 'Home Alone 3' because one of the original stars from the originals makes an appearance, and they use the classic John Williams theme music. I was intrigued by the story, and it managed to make me feel nostalgic, especially when they play 'Somewhere in my Memory' This time, we get to know the burglars, and come to care for them and why they're doing the robbing.Meet Pam and Jeff McKenzie, a down-on-their-luck couple who have to sell their house because it's getting too expensive to live there. They haven't told their children yet. During an open house, they run into 10-year old Max Mercer and his mom, Carol. They're only there because Max needed to stop and use the bathroom. On the way out, Max notices an ugly doll with an upside-down face. Max and Jeff have words over it and they finally leave. That night, Jeff researches the doll and finds that it's extremely rare and worth a lot. The only problem is that the doll is now missing.The next day, Max's family is on the way to the airport to Japan, and of course, Max gets left home alone. He reacts the same way Kevin McCallister did, then he gets bored and lonely. Pam and Jeff assume that Max took the doll, and track him to his house and try to get it back. Max unfortunately misunderstands their intentions and begins his battle plan to strike back against the burglars.I honestly feel that this movie is worthy of the Home Alone name. It gave me nostalgic feels like the first two, it has the classic John Williams music and it gave me a few laughs. I wouldn't mind watching it again. There are other easter eggs and nods to the original classic, too.

Typically, Korean films are very much based in real characters, social issues, and have an earthy approach that humanises their films beyond those of most countries. Bad Guy is no exception... while it is violent, confrontational, and decidedly dark, it bristles with underlying emotion and shows life without the rose coloured glasses. The characters are at times extremely emotional, and at others almost entirely emotionally void as they struggle constantly to keep their balance in circumstances that are spiraling around them.This is not an 'easy' film, in that it does not hand feed the viewer, there are no 'Jaws' style music queues to let you know when to be scared. You will need to work out how to feel for yourself with this one, which is fairly rare in this day and age. As said earlier, this movie is not for everyone, however if the concept sounds like something that interests you, then you should enjoy this film. If on the other hand you don't like the idea of watching a film based on the idea of a man forcing a woman into a life of sexual servitude, then stay well away from this film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFjMjk4MGQtNjYyMS00MjYzLTlhYjUtZGRiNWZhNDZjMTJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk4NTIzMzI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Like a Hitchcock Classic!","2008 Sundance Film Festival Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ (out of four)My favorite movie from the first day of Sundance 2008. Roy (a very young-looking Woody Harrelson) and Jessie (Emily Mortimer) are a young Iowa couple, returning from a church humanitarian mission in China via the Transsiberian Express, where they encounter the much more adventurous Carlos (Eduardo Noriega) and Abby (Kate Mara). Boarding mid-way is Ben Kingsley, who we have learned from the opening scene is a Moscow police detective.Like a Hitchcock classic, we are grabbed from the start with a feeling that things are not all as they seem, and don't lose that uneasy feeling that something very bad is going to happen until bad things really start happening. The tension is eerie and relentless, with telling glances and social conversation that suggest the relationships between these four are going to take a disturbing turn. Written by Director Brad Anderson (The Machinist), and inspired by a Transibberian trip he once took, the script is inspired and very tight, the characters infused with extraordinary depth and interest, the Russian state a harrowing umbrella and the dialog consistently powerful and compelling. (My favorite line, from Ben Kingsley, goes something like this: ""We have a saying in Russia: You can always go forward with a lie, but you can never go back."")As Anderson said in the Q&A, the confined spaces of trains make for heightened drama. Shot in Lithuania, the cinematography is haunting, capturing the mysterious, bleak and unsettled state of post-Soviet Russia, which makes for a marvelous backdrop to the action. This movie should do well in national release. Maybe very well. Sundance Moments: Brad Anderson and all the principals of the cast were at the Sundance premiere. More so than usual, they all praised Anderson as an extraordinary and meticulous director, one of the greats. Ben Kingsley noted that what attracted him to the movie, besides the Russian sub-story, was that the characters were archetypes and not caricatures, which is quite true. Anderson talked about how bitterly cold it was shooting in Lithuania.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ1NmQwY2QtOTBhNC00M2NjLWI2NjQtMzU2Yzg5Y2U5MGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEzNjc3MDQ5._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Where they are merely building characters.Catalyst happens, act two....If you have half a brain you INSTANTLY know who ""Mr Cross"" (The bad guy) is. Because of this, act two feels more like going through the motions. The repeated ""mystery"" behind Mr Cross is somewhat pointless because you will probably already know who it is.The reveal, act three....From here.. It's exceptionally fitting that Ludacris is starring in this film... because it all gets so very, very, very, ludicrous. It almost borders on an unintentional comedy. There are too many logic errors to list - wild leaps that wouldn't really be possible.All the acting was good, the constant unnatural lighting was an odd choice... purple, orange, green, pink.... never just normal lights. Made it visually more interesting.Overall it was an okay watch, but don't really expect too much.Regarding the ""propaganda"" aspect.....I would say the ""message"" here of exceptional bigotry by white characters is not really a good message for younger audiences. Portraying all white people as racist is no different than portraying all black people as pimp, hookers, or murderous drug dealers --- it's simply not true. Ya can't paint things with such a broad brush. While I don't deny bigotry exists.. I've never seen it to the extent expressed later in this film. And to be perfectly honest, I think it worked pretty well in act one of this film when it first rears its ugly head. However, all the usage after that scene was pointless and didn't add to the story in ANY way.I honestly wonder if these films which portray such bold, in-your-face, clearly defined, racism are not teaching mechanisms for younger viewers. And while this film avoided any white character using the N word.. it got as close as possible without it. So are they somehow showing younger white viewers what's ""okay"" in terms of how white people think of and act towards black people?? There's no subtlety in this film, no nuance - which is most commonly what actual racism looks like today. And there are no consequences for the racism, no pushback by other white characters.... it's simply portrayed as ""that's what all white people think.""","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE5YTA2YzMtNTY5MC00NmM4LTk5ZGYtZWE0N2ViNWJiZDMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAxNDE3MTE5._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Most people know Mervyn Leroy as a great director, but they may not recognize Beirne Lay, Jr. Lay was a B-17 pilot in the 100th Bomb Group, 8th AAF in WW II, and the co-author of the book ""12 O'Clock High"", from which the academy award movie of the same name was made.Many aspects of this film are great: its desert scenery, aerial photography and accuracy of detail in  regard to flight test during the 1950s are all top notch. The cast ,as played by such great character actors as Lloyd Nolan and an up and coming James Garner (a Korean War infantryman), are sincere and believable.What impressed me most then and more so now, is the way the film approached the issue of a Korean War POW who had ""cracked"". Remember, this picture came out more than 10 years before Americans saw the results of North Vietnamese treatment of our downed air crews. In the 1950s POWs were expected to give only name, rank and serial number if captured. Those that failed to stand fast, to what is now recognized as an unattainable standard, were shunned. Brainwashing and emotional torture weren't understood until years later.But this film used a very strong leading man (Holden) to focus on the sensitive issue of a ""broken"" pilot who tried to make his way back into American society and regain his dignity in the hardest court of opinion, the ranks of the active Air Force. Everything gels in this movie. It makes a good point many years ahead of its time. Under the same circumstances who knows how he'd survive being a POW? And ultimately we all can fail and redeem ourselves.I agree, they need to put this one out on DVD or VHS, so we can see it more than just on an occasional late night TV movie.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FkOTA2M2UtYWFmOS00YTViLWJkM2YtOTM0ZDg4MjQxZTQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQzNDI3NzY@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I think they are basing these complaints on how they imagine a ""normal"" person would react. The thing is...Betty is not a ""normal"" person, due to traumatic events in her childhood. She has problems way way before the movie ever even starts...and by the end of Opera...in my opinion...she has become totally unhinged.---------------------SPOILERS--------------------------------------- You have to keep in mind that when she was a very small child she witnessed her mother's lover commit at least one brutal murder while her sadomasochist mother was getting off watching it.She was raised by a woman who achieves sexual release tied up watching girls get hacked, slashed, and strangled to death. That does not make for a healthy home life. I think it's pretty easy to conclude that her mother would have employed all sorts of emotional manipulation and negative reinforcement to ensure that her daughter never snitched on her. It is also likely that at her impressionable age, Betty might have been deeply confused by what she saw. Is this just something that adults do, etc.Betty obviously looks up to her mother...I mean...she's become an opera singer just like her. If mommy likes it it can't be bad, can it...mommy can't be bad, can she? She couldn't tell the police on her mommy or this mysterious hooded fellow she associates with mommy.Betty has a lot of deep-seated emotional issues. Her mind has for years been trying to block out the memory of what she saw her mother doing...but it keeps coming to the surface, manifesting itself in the form of horrible nightmares, skull-throbbing migraines, a dependence on relaxation techniques, and sexual frigidity She associates brutal violence/bloody death with sex on a subconscious level. There's an inner struggle between the part of Betty that has confused murder/sex and the part of her which believes these things to be wrong.After she's seen her boyfriend murdered by the hooded man...she calls the police, yet is unwilling to give her name. The part of her that thinks murder is wrong forces her to make the call, but the part that is ambivalent won't allow her to admit personal involvement. The ambivalent part of her takes control before she can go all the way. So she walks away from the phone in the rain...and when she's picked up by the director she's acting surprisingly calm, not as upset as you would think a ""normal"" person would be...because the part of her that's been blocking stuff since she was a child is trying its damnedest to block the horror of what she's just witnessed.The state of affairs in her life all contribute to an impasse within Betty's psyche. Her singing career is starting to bear fruit...she's going to be a great opera singer like her mother was. But is she going to become like her mother in all ways? In the darker ways? Or will she be able to make her own path? Add this to the re-emergence of the hooded man murdering everyone around her.It's not until the hooded man kills Daria Nicolodi's character that Betty really takes an active role in defeating the killer. Here's someone who loves Betty, who's supported her wholeheartedly in her emerging career, who is in fact a maternal figure in Betty's life now since mommy's dead. Imagine how terrible it would be to lose your real mother and then to see the woman who is the closest thing you have to a mother get shot through the eyeball.I could go on...but I won't. The main gist of what I'm saying is that the character of Betty is a lot more complex than most of the reviewers on here have been willing to acknowledge.Opera is one of Argento's best...and not just for the visuals alone (although they are truly magnificent) and not just for the inventive murders (although they are). There is a depth here...and attention needs to be paid.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY3MjBhYTEtNmFjMi00ZGY2LWFjNDItMjJjNGIxZjc4NzFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Both men have a similarly nutty knockabout comic sensibility with a touch of the surreal, and this wacky farce about a motley crew of Miami citizens embroiled in a race to recover an atomic bomb seemed like the perfect vehicle for them to pool their talents on.  Well, it was! Hubby and I had a grand time -- but alas, we seemed to be among the very few moviegoers who even gave the flick a chance!  I guess it didn't help that BIG TROUBLE's originally-scheduled December 2001 release was delayed due to worries that a plot involving smuggling an A-bomb through laissez-faire airport security would seem more disturbing than funny after the horrific events of 9/11/2001.  Maybe most audiences are still too spooked right now to appreciate the satiric possibilities in Sonnenfeld & Co.'s cynically funny, Billy Wilder-esque treatment of these elements -- but I hope that down the line, folks will give BIG TROUBLE a chance, because really, it's like what might have resulted if Billy Wilder had ever had an opportunity to direct The Marx Brothers.  We were laughing throughout!  The ensemble cast is superb, from Patrick Warburton and Janeane Garofalo as members of Miami's Finest, to Tom Sizemore and Johnny Knoxville as dunderheaded crooks, to Tim Allen and Rene Russo's chemistry as single (well, unhappily married in Russo's case) parents who get drawn into the shenanigans when their respective teenage kids Ben Foster and Zooey Deschanel (both delightful -- I wouldn't be surprised if these two became big stars someday!) accidentally foil a hit on Stanley Tucci (hilariously obnoxious as Russo's dreadful second husband) by Jack Kehler and Dennis Farina (spoofing his earlier role in Sonnenfeld's GET SHORTY adaptation).

These were the vehicles the studios created for its stars of that era. It was either a Joan Crawford picture, or a Barbara Stanwyck, or a Bette Davis one, since their presence, bigger than life, was the only reason to bring these stories to the big screen.Take this one, for instance, under the direction of Irving Rapper. It had all the right elements, yet it was chaste enough to pass the censor. Undoubtedly, this movie owes a lot to the fantastic score by the talented Max Steiner who was a genius. Mr. Steiner's music plays the haunting melodies with such flair, we feel we are listening to a great symphonic work.The story, by today's standards wouldn't raise an eyebrow. At the time it came out, it was a different thing. After all, Jerry was a married man with a daughter and a situation that had no easy solution then. That makes Charlotte Vale suffer after she found her soul mate aboard the ship that served to free herself from a despotic mother.Bette Davis plays Charlotte to perfection. Her scenes with Paul Hendried lighting the two cigarettes is something to cherish by film fans. The chemistry that Bette Davis shared with her leading men was no small accomplishment. She was an actress that knew how to pull the heart strings of the general public. She had such a charisma and power to lose herself in all those strong women she played through the years. The transformation of the plain Charlotte to the smart woman, who embarks on a tour to begin a new life, is something out of a fairy tale, but Ms. Davis pulls it with great panache.The rest of the cast was excellent. Claude Rains, Gladys Cooper, Bonita Granville, Ilka Chase! They only come once in a lifetime. No one in present day Hollywood comes near to that. It was perfection.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ2YWUxOTctYWNjMi00NzE3LTg4MjUtMzUyNzA0OTJjZjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyOTc@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Hardly any other film comes as highly recommended as Black Sunday and after viewing this incredibly moody effort, I can easily see why. It's by far one of the most beautifully photographed films I've seen of any genre. It's also one of the most atmospheric; a sense of horror and dread hang over every frame, and yet it is a film whose power does not lie entirely in the narrative. It's hidden somewhere, pretty much everywhere... in dark corners, in secret crypts, in fog, in shadows... The shots in this film are brilliantly composed. It is a true triumph for director and cinematographer Mario Bava, who provides such rich, dream-like technical depth that (pardon the clichÃÂ©) this film truly does transport viewers somewhere else in time.Even though this movie is best appreciated as an exercise in style and technique, the plot line (witch who is executed and returns centuries later to get revenge on the descendants of her executioners) is also enjoyable. So is Barbara Steele, who is ideally cast in a dual role as both the evil witch and the pure heroine. She's an actress who can switch from innocent and ravishing to hideous and horrific with the flick of an eyelash. No wonder she's considered the queen of horror.

"Sangue per Dracula","1989.0","A","103.0","Horror","6.1","","Paul Morrissey","Joe Dallesandro, Udo Kier, Vittorio De Sica, Maxime McKendry","6,622","An ailing vampire count travels to Italy with his servant to find a bride.","69","Gory, sexy, witty and political updating of the classic tale.","'Blood for Dracula' began shooting the day principal photography for 'Flesh for Frankenstein' finished, and utilised the same three lead players: Udo Kier (as Dracula), Arno Jeurging (as his manservant) and Joe Dallesandro (as a socially conscious and randy farmhand). In comparison to the earlier film, 'Blood for Dracula' may appear somewhat more restrained, with less of the delirium and dementia which made it's sister movie so memorable, but in place of the outrageous black humour and OTT excesses it possesses a more subtle sense of satire and a frequently beautiful and poetic visual style.Just a quick recap of the story: Dracula, who is here only able to feed from the blood of virgin girls, is forced to leave his ancestral home in Transylvania (apparantly he's exhausted the supply there) and travel to Italy with his manservant, under the pretence of seeking a 'suitable wife'. They come across a family of supposedly noble stock, whose daughters are not in fact as pure as they might seem to be. This is due to the presence of a hot-headed young farmhand, whose political ideologies have been much influenced by the recent revolution in Russia...Morrissey's first image in the film is a mischievously existential sequence that immediately works to blur the distinction between the realm of the film and that of the filmmakers. Dracula, a bone white albino, is seen applying black dye to his hair, rouge to his cheeks and ochre to his lips in an effort to appear more robust and more human. The obvious parallel is that of an actor being made up in preparation for a scene; Dracula's 'scene' is the rest of the movie and therefore we do not see this process repeated. Opening with such an introspective shot, one that is entirely outside the narrative and which so successfully marries the worlds before and behind the camera, denotes the artistic sensibility which will lend the film a modernist flavour and throw the hokier aspects of vampire lore into sharp relief. Here Dracula merely has an aversion to sunlight, garlic and crucifixes, rather than crumbling to dust at the sight of them; if outside during the day he only shields his face with his hat, and in his room at the inn he simply takes down the cross on the wall and puts it away in a drawer. It's a good example of how rules of legend as interpreted through iconic cinema (think Bela Lugosi repulsed by a crucifix, or Max Shreck dissolving in the dawn's light) are not binding in any sense, and in any case such constraints on the character would sit badly with the plot of the film. The director's personal touch allows him to express his ideas with more structure and balance, which makes for a more satisfying and coherent picture.In 'Flesh for Frankenstein', Morrissey used the basic set up of the Frankenstein story, itself heavy with Freudian overtones in the context of Man attempting to create life independently of Woman, to showcase and satirise a gallery of corrupting behaviour and sexual deviancy. Here the contemporary relevance is the political subtext of the Dracula myth. The Count as a wealthy aristocrat is presented as both a literal and metaphorical vampire: he drains the blood of innocents in order to perpetuate his existence, and his social class figuratively leeches off the lower orders for it's own survival. His sickly pallor and physical frailty is both representative of his caste's dying influence and perhaps also a comment upon the debilitating results of long term inbreeding; a sharp contrast to the youthful strength and virility of Joe Dallesandro. The character of the latter is a dedicated communist who despises the Count for being, as he sees him, the wasted product of an archaic and fading tradition of social inequality, and the perception of aristocracy as decrepit and defunct extends to, and is reinforced by, the Italian family upon who's daughters the count has set his sights. Clearly once wealthy and influential they have now fallen on hard times and are under financial strain; the daughters work in the fields and gardens and the house is in need of repair and redecoration which they cannot afford. Hence the Mother's desire to marry one of her children into a moneyed lineage, in spite of such an unattractive groom and her daughters' unsuitability for his requirements, is an act of both base greed and snobbish ambition.The film also makes great use of the power of human sexuality. One character early in the film remarks, upon hearing of the Count's intention to marry: 'A wife? He doesn't look up to it!' Indeed the key to Dracula's undoing is ultimately sex. He cannot drink the blood of non-virgins, yet is tricked several times into drinking the contaminated blood of the family's daughters, which leads to bouts of copious vomiting. His servant's somewhat erroneous belief that Italy is a good place to find a chaste wife, because of that countries Catholicism, demonstrates his unfortunate reliance on, and faith in, the upholding of old fashioned principles. The girls' unrestrained sexual familiarity with Dallesandro is indicative of their embracing of a more modern and unconcerned attitude to sex, where the crumbling social climate and values of their parent's generation have little bearing. When Dracula reveals that due to his families' 'traditions' he can only marry a virgin, the Marchesa knowingly tries to palm him off with her daughters, whom she knows are experienced, anyway. There is little genuine sense of honour about such duplicity; the motivation is wealth even at the expense of her children's happiness. Morrissey is always quick to savage the supposedly sacred community of the family; in 'Flesh for Frankenstein' it was blighted by incest and depravity, and here the briefly seen relationship between Dracula and his sister (also a vampire) is more touching and heartfelt than the caustic behaviour of the Di Fiore's toward one another. The film remains to the end a coruscating and biting take on human values. At it's conclusion the enforced tyranny of an autocratic society has symbolically been put to a bloody end and supplanted by another: that of communist oppression. It is not a happy ending, perhaps because Dracula here is a much more pitiable and ambiguous character than generally depicted in other films. He does not communicate a sense of being an evil and vicious monster; he comes across as a weak and highly strung aesthete, delicate, sensitive and refined (the fact that he can only drink the uncontaminated blood of virgins is an extension of his discerning tastes and a genuine reflection of the traditional requirements of well-bred families in matters of marriage). Violence is abhorrent to him, yet ironically it is concomitant with his survival, whereas Dallesandro's character is brutish, self righteous and far more morally dubious (he more or less rapes the youngest daughter so that Dracula cannot now feed from her impure blood).The key performances here are perfectly realised and genuinely involving. Kier captures the lethargy and malaise of the ailing Count with inimitable panache, although in order to shed the necessary weight for the role he simply didn't eat anything and was therefore actually too weak to move most of the time anyway! Arno Jeurging here plays an authoritative, arrogant and controlling servant who is worlds away from the submissive and degenerate Otto character in 'Flesh for Frankenstein', while Maxime McKendry imparts a very real sense of desperation in her part as a declining aristocrat grasping at straws in a changing economic climate.  Dallesandro here seems as out of place as he was in FFF, with a hilariously anachronistic Brooklyn accent despite supposedly being a second-generation servant to the family. You could look at this as the Director articulating his indifference to the conventional importance of verisimilitude, or merely the inclusion of a bankable international star for the purpose of returns at the box office (I suppose it depends on how cynical you're feeling). Whatever, Dallesandro endows his character with the sense of preening and aggressive self-importance that is vital for the film, where the intention is to have no clearly demarcated hero and villain. The girls are all achingly beautiful and shed their clothes at almost every opportunity, while two notable directors, Vittorio De Sica and Roman Polanksi (!) have brief parts as the Merchese and a cunning villager respectively. Jeurging's mother also plays a small role as a customer at the inn.Gore wise, although the film, as noted, somewhat lacks the unrelenting intensity of FFF's flying entrails and severed heads, it is still not for the squeamish. The protracted scenes of Dracula throwing up unsuitable blood into the bath are pretty gross, as is his lying on the floor to sup at the remains of the youngest daughter's hymen after Dallesandro takes matters into his own hands. The conclusion takes the grotesquery to the heights of blackly comic inevitability, with a mess of severed limbs and a double puncture with a single stake. However, the elegance of the cinematography, despite the low budget, renders these scenes almost as beautiful in their own perverse way as the long establishing shots of the Italian countryside.This film, like it's predecessor, remains a genuine cult classic, and in my opinion they are both valuable documents of the prevalent artistic attitudes of their day and two of the most important, literate, well composed and intelligent horror films of the last thirty years. Maybe someday Morrissey and Kier may make another. Here's hoping.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGU2ZGJmODYtZWUwZS00NTcxLWE2ZGMtMWY1NzUxOGJiZTM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTc5MDI5NjE@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Mad indeed! I had a hard time relating to the characters, and simply couldn't understand what this movie was about, other than Harley and her friends talking, arguing, shooting up, and repeat. After an hour or so, I simply gave up trying to care of understand what this incomprehensible mess was trying to get at. I don't mean to sound harsh, but it's been a long time that I have felt so utterly disconnected from a movie (and I see LOTS of movies). I got the sense that the Safdie brothers were going for that same vibe usually associated with Harmony Korine (""Kids"", ""Spring Breakers""), except that they lack the vision which Korine lays out in his movies (and you may or may not agree with his vision, but he has one).""Heaven Knows What"" opened without any pre-release fanfare or advertising at my local art-house theater in Cincinnati last week. As a fan of indie movies, I took a flyer on this and, despite not knowing much of the movie, I went to see this a few days ago. The early evening screening where I saw this at turned out to be a private screening, as in: I was literally the only person in the theater. Had I known more about the movie beforehand, it surely would've been a completely empty screening. As it turns out, I made a mistake going to see this movie as it's not worth seeing.

I just saw it again on DVD and my first impression of the film holds up. But through my having aged my perspectives have matured, and now I also find 'An Unmarried Woman' to be perhaps the finest capturing of 1977's zeitgeist - but only the zeitgeist of upper middle class New Yorkers (Mazursky better captured the wider 70's zeitgeist in 'Harry and Tonto).Here Mazursky shows that, whatever else he is accused of being or doing or not-doing (with which I don't always agree or disagree), is a thoughtful director taking a good, long, realistic look at this drama and at more than just its central character. I liked that some scenes ran on for a bit longer than some people find necessary or comfortable, because this is how life's scenes often play out beyond one's wanting them to end swiftly and tidily: indeed, the slight overrunning of some scenes contributes what today might be called ""value-added"" realism to 'An Unmarried Woman.' After all, Erica has, involuntarily, been thrust into a new life in which she's not at ease in every one of its developing, novel situations.The saxophone score - probably considered hip in 1977 - is today often more than a trifle annoying; but then it could be said that the score is part of the film's capture of the 70's zeitgeist: like all decades the 70's had its annoyances (not the least of which was the dismal monotony of disco, and all those decor-saturating browns, olives (avocado it was called!), honey-golds, and tawny oranges).The cinematography here is quite good, nicely tailored to the film's intimate subject, situations, and relationships. Throughout the acting is uniformly good; Jill Clayburgh's effort here is, and will remain I expect, a cinema original and classic. I especially enjoyed - not when I first saw the film but much more so now in 2006 - Cliff Gorman's portrayal of self-satisfied, on-the-make Charlie. Andrew Duncan in the minor role of Bob lends great verisimilitude with his pre-""hair systems"" comb-over but especially with the touch of about-to-be-over-the-hill despair in Bob's attempt to bed Erica; Bob demonstrates that most men in that decade, beginning as they were to be flummoxed by emerging liberated women and feminism, still clung to the suddenly obsolescent notion that a divorcÃÂ©e would and should be eager to remarry in order to traditionally assure her security and peace of mind.At my first viewing I agreed with what Tanya, Erica's therapist, said to Erica about guilt being a manufactured, unnecessary emotion. But a good many more years of living have taught me that guilt is not manufactured, and that without it a person is doomed to emptiness and isolation, and a society is doomed to decadence, and even to barbarism. Rather Tanya should have held that guilt is natural, and that it is one's mature management of it that enables one to distinguish, in oneself and in others, venality and narcissism from generosity of spirit.'An Unmarried Woman' still stands on its own - more as a socio-cultural than as a cinematic landmark. It's that rare kind of film that's worth watching every five or ten years, if only to help us to recall where we've come from, and to help us to profit from, or to enjoy, a sense of where we might be going.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNhNzU5OGItZDk5Zi00NjJlLTkzMGMtZDNmNjQ5ZjZjZjRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The plot was thin and the story was ropy but the design of the space crafts and space battles scenes gave it a stylish look that could have been built upon with the sequel.Instead in terms of the VFX work nothing really connects the first film with the sequel and the style is lost.

Nelson, Dennis Hopper","9,431","During the Cold War, a controversial television journalist is asked by the C.I.A. to persuade certain acquaintances, who are Soviet Agents of the Omega network, to defect.","60","Ahead of its time - brilliant, entertaining, insightful","When this movie originally came out, five years after CONVOY (a muddled, but in many ways spectacular entertainment), many critics moaned that Peckinpah had yet again displayed his diminished talent. A Ludlum spy thriller, pulp material, given the Peckinpah stamp was not to be taken seriously, period. What nonsense. To begin with, all of Peckinpah's films spring from pulp, and all of them, even the least successful ones, buck and spin with the way Sam applies his vision to the genre conventions he's messing with. In simple terms, a Peckinpah movie always illustrates the world according to Sam; like a novelist writing in first person, Sam's point of view is the movie's. And that's why they endure today. In THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND, Peckinpah focuses Ludlum's cold war spy antics into a exploration of urban paranoia and governmental abuse. Video as a means to manipulate perception is one of the themes he exploits here, but that's not his main thrust. A group of affluent characters come together for a weekend that turns into a surreal nightmare. The trappings of success that surround this group are not in any way secure enough to withstand the violent, reckless games played on them by a rouge CIA agent (played by John Hurt) who's motive is personal revenge. And that motive, the revenge that fuels his need, in actual fact, has absolutely nothing to do with the affluent group he's playing with. Like the gods in Greek tragedy, the Hurt character uses the Osterman Weekend and its players as pawns, stepping stones, as a way to get at his real goal, the head of the CIA. This notion obviously strikes a chord in Peckinpah; the vision is certainly domestic, but the idea is epic: in the privacy of our homes a kind of virus colors our perceptions and poisons friendships, creates anarchy, and causes death. And the virus - where does it come from? Our own back yard - the CIA. The film is charged with a constant underlying tension that holds and holds until all hell breaks loose and the affluent house becomes a battle ground. Visually, the movie is stunning. But then, so was CONVOY, but this time Peckinpah has harnessed what he shows and what he wants to say in a simple, tightly wound spy thriller package, Watching the movie today, it's hard to believe that some of the notions that seemed more like the paranoiac mechanics of a potboiler in 1983 have actually come true and don't seem quite as far fetched. By all accounts, Sam Peckinpah was a terribly difficult man, but he was also a visionary film maker who's work gets better and better as the years pass. THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND is not the bad film critics at the time bitched about, and it's not the sad conclusion to a career that started out brimming with possibility. It's a splendid, brilliant - better than brilliant - work of American art by a true American artist: a giant. The world according to Sam is a world that will be looked at a hundred years from now; it will inspire debate, continual analysis, and be ranked with the major artist of the entire 20th century. By 1983,Peckinpah's health may have diminished, but as a film maker he was still powerful and strong as hell.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDk0MGM4ZjMtNjQ2Yi00NmViLTk5ZDUtZDA0ZTUxODgzNGQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

First let me say, I'm a horror fan, not an expert by any means, but I like a good horror film as much as the next guy.Secondly, I actually saw the movie at the NYC Horror Film Festival, where the movie got a standing ovation. Let me repeat that: The movie got a STANDING OVATION. And from what I understand, this was the only time this movie has screened thus far, so I wish someone could please explain to me how and where all these negative reviewers saw it. Everyone in New York seemed to love it. There's no way all these people writing negative stuff could've seen the movie as there were only 300 or so people in the audience and everyone loved it. Remember the standing ovation? I do.Regardless of what these frauds have written, the movie was good. I'm certainly not claiming it was the greatest or scariest film ever made, but it was certainly a good, fast moving, hide- your-face in your hands movie. The lead actress was hot, and moved from ""put upon"" to ""tough"" very well. In addition to having a great body, she was self-assured and sexy. The other girls were hot as well.The horror beats were scary and the movie had enough tension and mystery to keep me interested the whole time. There were also some great scares, original kills, and a few great gory moments. Look for the scene where Tamara emerges from the grave -- I was freaked out. Compared to a lot of the clichÃÂ©d, over-the-top-gore out there, Tamara stood out as a good movie. It has a story and some excellent tension. Sexy and scary (and hot high school chicks) in one movie -- my kind of flick.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MzA0NDI0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjEwNjkzMQ@@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

They love each other, but maintaining a relationship through technology proves challenging.","11","An honest and tender representation of how relationships cope with an ocean between them.","Ready for some bold words? If 10.000Km remains my favorite film of the London Film Festival I will be 100% satisfied. Either way, it's set a high bar for Mr. Turner, Whiplash and Foxcatcher to beat. On the premise alone, Carlos Marques-Marcet long-distance romance had my investment. I've gone through, am going through, will go through everything the film is about. I can attest that the characters and situations are painted authentically in every facet. While some may argue that the film is coming late to document the modern ways that couples connect with each other, it doesn't feel that the film is latching onto any zeitgeist and is simply a matter-of-fact part of our lives from now on. Marques-Marcet's economy in the storytelling is terrific. It begins with a stunning but simple 23 minute long take. It's more Before Midnight than Gravity, but the poetic and organic blocking adds so much to a deliberately limited dynamic. Within that shot, we know everything about the bond between Alex (Natalie Tena) and Sergi (David Verdageur) and how painful it's going to be to see them torn apart, as the former receives the opportunity to live in Los Angeles for a year. But this opening also showcases the endearing sense of humour the film has, particularly from Sergi, who teeters on mean-spiritedness with his well-meaning sarcasm. They're immediately identifiable in their mid-20s joys, hopes and dilemmas, and they're the only characters we'll see on screen throughout the film. Everyone else is but a blurred out face. The length of that opening shot is key to the rhythm of the film. There isn't much of a narrative besides the abstract form of their relationship's turbulence and so once Alex is in Los Angeles the structure becomes very fragmented into daily sections, some lasting less than a minute. It truly captures the isolation and the way time flies waiting without progress. But it also captures the warmth couples feel as they interact via Skype in a sincere way while still having natural friction. Every little freeze of the program feels ideally orchestrated by Marques-Marcet as it feeds into the spontaneity and sensitivity of the performances. It takes a little to upset the balance. There's an interesting idea about the physicality of their online relationship when Alex visits the server farms of Silicon Valley and contemplates about how their relationship has been stored in 1s and 0s somewhere there. It raises fascinating questions about subjective representation, something that anyone who's met an online friend can confirm. For something that matters to most to people Ã¢ÂÂ romance Ã¢ÂÂ something that feels the most real, is only a simulation of a feeling. It's easy to project feelings on someone whose not there, which the characters feel often. It's bolstered by Alex's role as a photographer, as she takes artistic representations of things, and her photos of camouflaged antennas are our only hint to her job. It digs its fingers under the anxiety of romance being artificial under the circumstances and studies it gently, pulsating through the character's actions. This is the starring role that Natalie Tena (of Game of Thrones and Harry Potter) has been waiting for. I'd always known her since I saw About A Boy upon its release and didn't recognize her until halfway through the film. She's tender and visceral in the best way. Both performances are perfectly measured and restrained until they reach their respective explosive points. Every little thing builds and builds and you can read everything they feel in just their expressions. David Verdageur appears to channel last year's Oscar Isaac's Llewyn Davis, not only in the bearded look but the subdued disgruntled temperament with the sense of humour. However, he makes it his own and his contradictions lead our opinion to constantly fluctuate but ultimately sympathize with him. They deservedly won the acting duo award at this year's SXSW festival. Finally, it boasts a refreshingly ambiguous ending in a sea of overtly technophobic films. It knows that it can't be conclusive about the positives and negatives of a long distance relationship bonded by daily Skyping. It doesn't spell out any assumptions as it's not as simple as a happy ever after or a break up for good. Instead, it's a quiet reflection on what their relationship had been missing, one that the film leaves for the audience to judge for themselves instead of the characters. It's a thoroughly profound note to leave the film and one that rewards on consideration, true to it's otherwise slight but powerful nature. It truly connected with me on every level, not only in things I personally relate to, but in things that I hadn't even thought of. It's not a requirement to have experienced a long distance relationship to like this film as it certainly has something to admire for any empathetic viewer. If there were any justice, 10.000 Km would join the race for Best Foreign Language film, but as Spain submitted Living Is Easy With Eyes Closed, hopefully this will find a mainstream audience that can also relate to its anguish. With nuanced and relatable performances, rich textured cinematography and a keen sense of pacing; it encapsulates every honest high and low about contemporary relationships with an ocean between them. I really can't give enough praise to 10.000 Km and it deserves way more attention. 9/10Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTU5OTlhZGMtN2IzZC00MTY5LWI5MWYtMzFhNzFlZjZkZTA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTU3NDU4MDg2._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The very structure of the film's slums serves itself as a visual metaphor for the Camorra crime institution in Naples. It's a bureaucratic shuffle, rivaling a large capitalist corporation, equally ruthless but in different senses of the term. Their products are drugs, extortion, and toxic sludge. Their version of corporate take-over involves murderously shameless acts of extreme violence.Matteo Garrone deftly directs Gomorra, based on the novel of the same name by Roberto Saviano. It contains a labyrinth plot serving to depict a labyrinth lifestyle. One storyline focuses on a young boy, Toto, who lives in that decaying pyramid, and wants to join up with the gangsters who run it. By the end of the film, his youth will be shattered, and he'll have done things to those around him that would have seemed unthinkable before. He's the ground soldier in the gangster empire.Don Ciro is an aging money runner, delivering rations to the families of mob prisoners. He gets increasingly caught between the war between factions within the complexes, and before long takes to wearing a bullet proof vest in fear of his own safety.Roberto is a college graduate, given a high profile job working with Franco, who runs a scheme disposing of garbage and waste from the city by burying it in the countryside - a move that has sent the cancer rate in the countryside through the roof. Roberto must face his own conscious as he becomes more and more aware of the corruption of work.Pasquale is a talented designer, who's put to work by his friend and boss completing a contract for dresses in less time than he and the workers should like. At great personal risk to himself, he takes an offer from a Chinese factory boss to gives lessons to his workers. The job means crossing the Comorra, so he is hidden in the trunk on the drive to the factory, with a modified hole behind the backseat so he can stick his head out to breath and chat.The other storyline follows two Scarface-wannabes who long to be the crime bosses of all bosses. They cross the local boss by stealing drugs from dealers, causing trouble, then by stealing weapons from a mob cache, raising Cain. They are knuckle-heads, a couple of kids too stupid to see the truth behind the phony glorification of the gangster lifestyle.That phony glorification is entirely absent here. Garrone observes his gangsters with an eye of contempt. There is no Robin Hood imagery in Gomorra. It puts on full display the ruthlessness of the gangster culture. It's a gangster as capitalist world, one where turning to killing kids or a woman is looked down upon, but not off-limits.The film starts off with a fantastic sequence of tanning machines and surprisingly graphic murder, which would lead one to think that they were moving headlong into a Scorsese-like blood bath of macabre. You'd be wrong though. Gomorra is a very patient film, slowly unraveling its stories. It's clearly influenced by the early Italian Neo-Realists, and also has elements that reminded me of the gangster pictures of Jean-Pierre Melville. Garrone shoots in a documentary style with hand-held camera shots. It jumps between its story lines with utmost patience, which might slow down the film's pace more than many would like or are accustomed to. If you do not realize the scope of the Camorra's activity in nearly all facets of commercial and communal life in and around Naples, the connection between the stories may seem unclear. But that's one of the main services of the picture, to show us just how entrenched the mafia has remained in parts of Italy.Although mob movies are a dime a dozen, Gamorra enters as a gangster epic with freshness. It's a very European film, and as far as gangster pictures go, with its no nonsense documentary style, and only slowly escalating violence and patience it feels like a unique addition to the genre. Gomorra is sure to split, maybe even downright annoy audiences looking for something more conventional. It defies at least most of the genre's clichÃÂ©s, and aims high with its quiet ambitions.Gomorra won the Grand Prix at this year's Cannes Film Festival, and has been slotted as Italy's official entry into the 2009 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NDgzMDY4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzUwMzg5MQ@@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I have been a happy and healthy Dominican Sister for over 40 years, and I was optimistic that this would be a good film. I'm really sorry I wasted two hours on it. It does not do justice to the times, the complexity of the changes that began to emerge with Vatican II, and it is not even accurate in describing the process of becoming a nun. So I just wonder where Margaret Betts got her information. Did she interview anybody who actually stayed and found happiness in religious life? I doubt it. There was no joy, no sense of companionship or sense of being part of something exciting. No real narrative about what the impact of Vatican II had on Catholic thought, just a few superficial conversations between the Archbishop and the Reverend Mother. It is a bleak and morose story of postulant Cathleen's struggle to survive a mean and closed minded mother superior whose ego should have driven her to confession.Too bad, this could have been a great story, with compelling dialogue, dramatic tension, and a breakthrough moment of personal change. Instead it was a painful exaggeration of the predictable inaccurate stereotypes of Catholic Sisters, complete with Nun-Zilla. It gives people who have always hated the Catholic Church a good reason to keep hating it. Margaret Betts was scheduled to Skype in and have a conversation with the audience at the theater we attended. I'm kind of glad she could not make it. The sisters in the audience would have had a hard time coming up with something nice to say.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NDQzNTY2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjgxMTMyMzI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

And this particular movie wasn't really all that great. But by The Asylum's usual standards, then it was actually a step up the ladder.""The Coed and the Zombie Stoner"" seemed to borrow a little bit too much from ""Warm Bodies"", whether intentional or by random sheer luck, I have no idea. But it was also mixed in with some fairly average standard teenage college comedy. The end result, well it could have been better. And speaking of borrowing things, then the whole '28 days earlier' segment was actually one of the brighter moments in the movie, as it was a clear spoof on ""28 Days Later"".The storyline was adequate, but just don't expect the movie to challenge your intellect in any possible way. This is the type of movie you just sit back and switch off your brain to while watching.One of the flaws of the movie were the cast and their acting. It wasn't particularly great in any way, nor was it particularly convincing most of the time. And that made the movie suffer a terrible blow.For zombie aficionados, then there is very little good stuff to find here. The zombies are mere people with basic make-up added, don't expect decayed shambling corpses or corpses with missing limbs, you will just be sorely disappointed.There was a little bit of gore throughout the movie, and it was used in a good enough way for a comedy such as this. And while speaking of comedy, then there were awfully few times throughout the movie that I was laughing, or even just smiling for that matter.While ""The Coed and the Zombie Stoner"" is hardly a noteworthy addition to the collection of any zombie fan, do take note that there are far worse and less entertaining zombie movies on the market that actually try to pass as proper zombie movies in the horror/action genre. ""The Coed and the Zombie Stoner"" is the type of movie that you watch one, and never make a return trip to.And do take notice that there is a fair amount of unnecessary nudity throughout the movie. So if you are offended by such, consider this a friendly heads up warning.""The Coed and the Zombie Stoner"" scores a mere 4 out of 10 stars from me.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwMDYwMDg2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTcwMzk4MTE@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Satanic Rites is an infinitely superior movie, however, and easily the best of the Hammer Dracula sequels. Previous sequels had seen the Count resurrected only to lurk in the shadows and momentarily reveal himself to take his revenge on his foes, reducing Christopher Lee's Dracula to little more than a glorified extra. Satanic Rites is different because it uses Lee's scant appearances to its advantage, keeping Dracula aloof and mysterious and instead concerning itself with the disease of vampirism, which is compared to a plague. Because of it's science fiction overtones, this feels more like an instalment of The Avengers or Doctor Who than a typical Hammer film. In its present-day setting and apocalyptic storyline, it also seems to be a definite influence on the highly-regarded TV series Ultraviolet. For the fan of classic Hammer Gothic Horror, this is probably best avoided, but for those who enjoy British telefantasy it's an absolute must see.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWUwNDliOTYtN2IwZC00MzlhLTgwMTAtNmU0ZWZhNTA2NDViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDc2NjEyMw@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

"Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead","1989.0","","117.0","Comedy, Drama","7.3","","Tom Stoppard","Gary Oldman, Tim Roth, Richard Dreyfuss, Livio Badurina","23,881","Two minor characters from the play 'Hamlet' stumble around unaware of their scripted lives and unable to deviate from them.","130","The Play Without the Play","As an architect, I am often asked what is the world's best building. The answer: a small chapel outside Barcelona started by Gaudi but never finished. We have the model (a bunch of strings) and the basement. But when one visits, it is a profoundly lifechanging place. Gaudi exceeded the building's budget, and then that of the whole community (which was to have been built) before getting out of the ground. But the ambition was so grand, one can see it with only the barest explicit minimum. But, you have to have the reference of what the master intended.Hamlet is the same. It was never really finished, being so large a conception. Shakespeare tinkered and added over decades. So what Stoppard does here is expand Hamlet by shrinking it. The plot is only glimpsed, but that part was always incidental anyway. The play is about reasoning, and when things are real and when not, and about what element of reality is causal. So instead of giving us the language, Stoppard seizes on one device, the play within the play.In the raw Hamlet, this is pretty rich, but Stoppard weaves new dimensions of inversion and self-reference. There are at least four levels of play here, and we keep switching about, together with most of the characters. This is not just amusing, but elaborates on `Hamlet,' when is fate real? would it change if we could see the larger clockworks of the universe? does language (specifically query) aid in this endeavor? considering that, are ideas tied to time and fate? This last point is comically illustrated as one of the pair (they don't know who is who) keeps `stumbling' on great ideas, which then vanish.The play (Stoppard's first) seems to have been his one excellent work, followed by the mundane. Some are unhappy because the film is not so frantic as the 1967 play, but I think that is because there is a different dynamic with a film audience than a stage audience. Fewer tricks can be played. But this is a wonderful solution to the problem of language in film: it is just not cinematic, so best to exploit the dissonance.There's risk here. The film as film is not great, so set that aside. And the notions are dangerously sophomoric. But that's what makes the whole thing so darned funny. Some critics (notably the normally intelligent Stanley Kauffmann) think Roth and Oldham are poor. But this is a strange sort of acting demand, one for which no measures exist: part surreal, part comic (in different traditions, half Monty Python, half Abbot and Costello) and part tragic confusion. They reward my trust and that's what matters I think. Dreyfus is supposed to be over the top, and he complies.In the great Hamlet sweepstakes, many recommend seeing Mel Gibson and then Gwyneth Paltrow. I suppose that's a colorful route. But the real sense of what this is all about comes through with more real reward via Branagh and then this clever film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc0MTU0MDY1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDI2OTY2NA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I think it's because: A) Milos Forman is unquestionably a better director than Frears, especially when he can call on the photographic talents of a cinematographer like Miroslav Ondricek; B) ""Valmont"" takes the time to develop some of the relationships between characters on screen, while the other simply injects the viewers into preexisting relationships; C) Colin Firth and Annette Benning are quite simply sexier than Glenn Close and John Malkovich; ""Dangerous Liaisons"" is too intellectual, while ""Valmont"" works at the hormonal level too. D) Fairuza Balk is far more believable as a virgin than Uma Thurman (can anyone say differently?!?).

After watching the film 7 times in Tokyo, I can say the film's production was world-class. Cinematography, film editing, sound design, sound editing, production set design, costume design, hair and makeup, music are other aspects to die for. Miike had done an excellent directing job on the cast, especially its leading role, Manji (Takuya Kimura). Miike had successfully brought the best out of Kimura, shedding his KimuTaku's branding. In the film, Kimura portrayed Manji through and through. I almost forgot I was watching an idol actor who used to characterize squeaky-clean images in TV dramas. The role was so deep that you believed it was Manji's story and his immortal life that you really care about. Of course, the film will not be complete without the fine acting skills from co-stars. Hana Sugisaki, Sota Fukushi and Erika Toda had put on their ultimate to-die-for performance. The fighting scenes were artistically choreographed. The sound of swords clanging made your heart beat in sync with its rhythm. The script was well paced. There were moments of thrilling fights and there were moments of quietness.

The two main leads in this film seemed more like pretty faces on a billboard than actors with real chemistry. The acting, to put it kindly, was subpar to say the least, which is ironic given the big names who came to play in this. Don't even get me started with the cringetopia that was the first meet-up between the main leads.And let's not forget about Gina Torres, who sadly became a caricature of herself in this film. Known for her captivating performances in the past, it was disheartening to see her reduced to a one-dimensional, over-the-top cringe portrayal.And oh, the patchy editing! Is it an avant-garde attempt at abstract art, or did someone accidentally spill coffee on the cutting room floor? I must admit, it was quite the artistic statement-except the statement was ""please stop torturing me with this jumbled mess."" The sporadic cuts and disjointed scenes were positively headache-inducing, almost like a migraine set to music. Irritation level: off the charts!Here's the thing: I didn't go into this film expecting a cinematic masterpiece or an Oscar-worthy performance. I simply wanted a guilty pleasure romcom-a light-hearted addition to my list of shamelessly enjoyable flicks. But alas, I ended up drowning in a sea of regret for sacrificing a precious 90 minutes of my life. If only I could request a refund for lost time!Now, let's talk about that third act. What on earth was that? Seriously, it was a blob of unnecessary events which left me questioning if someone was trying to live out their wildest fantasies through the characters.In conclusion, this film was a cringeworthy disaster that left me irritated to the core. The lack of chemistry, subpar acting, and puzzling editing choices made it a regrettable experience. If you're looking for an award-winning performance, you won't find it here. But if you're in the mood for an unintentional comedy or a masterclass in what not to do in filmmaking, then by all means, grab your popcorn and prepare for a wild ride.Rating: One star (for every pretty face, but that's about it!)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDFiNjQ0NWMtZjgwZC00MjRlLThlMjAtMDg4YWIzY2QzNmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDc5ODIzMw@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

With subject matter as complex as this, the viewer can see where one could easily become lost in C.S. Lewis's story, but ""Shadowlands"" never falters. The film remains quiet, simple, and highly effective through Attenborough's understated direction, and its cast's uniformly excellent performances. However, what sits at the very core of ""Shadowlands"" beauty is its ultimate truth. There are moments in this film so full of genuine, unflynching emotion that its power practically hits the audience member in the gut. Yes, the film's magnificently depicted scenes of death and grieving never fail to jerk tears from my eyes, but Lewis's closing lines regarding the choices he made as a boy and a man make me sob.

Wellman","John Wayne, Claire Trevor, Laraine Day, Robert Stack","6,561","When a commercial airliner develops engine problems on a trans-Pacific flight and the pilot loses his nerve, it is up to the washed-up co-pilot Dan Roman to bring the plane in safely.","154","Not the classic everyone ""remembers""","I went to the DVD premiere screening of THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY tonight (12 June 2005) at Paramount studios. It was a big red-carpet event, and I saw a number of people associated with the film there, though there are a scant handful of the cast still surviving. Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez, William Campbell, and Robert Easton were there, and from bits of applause during the screening, I suspect that a few others were there as well. Of course, all of the major character players are gone: Wayne, Stack, Trevor, Day, Sterling, Harris, Newton, Brian, Kelly, Blackmer, and Qualen. Other than Karen Sharpe and William Schallert, I'm not certain whether anyone yet unmentioned is still alive. Doe Avedon probably is (she was really lovely as the flight attendant).As some have speculated, there's no way for this film to live up to the hype that has grown up because of its near-forty year unavailability. It's been beautifully restored. The picture quality seems to my uneducated eye to be impeccable, and the sound is really magnificent. And there are some moments of nice performance, particularly by Wayne, Robert Stack, Jan Sterling, and John Qualen. But as much as I would love to say this is a resurrected masterpiece, it simply isn't possible for me to do so honestly. After AIRPLANE!, I'm not sure it's reasonable to expect people to take a Fifties airliner disaster movie seriously. But the level of corn and hokum and treacle and syrup in which the film wallows (especially in the primary sections dealing with the passengers rather than the crew) is simply intolerable in today's world. I'm not referring to the fact that it's a different practical world now, one in which it would be ludicrous to show a passenger pulling a gun on another passenger on an airliner of today. I'm referring rather to the simple unbelievability of the human behavior exhibited. I'm willing to accept a passenger getting aboard a trans-Pacific airliner with a gun in his pocket in 1954. I'm not willing to accept him pulling that gun, threatening other passengers with it, having it taken from him, and later having it handed back to him just because he says, ""I'm all right now, I've calmed down."" Phil Harris, fifty at the time and looking sixty, plays a 38-year-old, and 43-year-old Ann Doran plays his 30-year-old wife. Laraine Day berates her husband and demands a divorce, and good ol' Phil says to the husband, ""You think you got problems?"" and proceeds to tell him about how rain and crummy hotels ruined his vacation, and the husband (John Howard) thus sees his own life in a new perspective. Every clichÃÂ© imaginable comes into play, and rarely is there a moment that can be easily swallowed, even with Herculean efforts to place oneself mentally in the zeitgeist of the film.Only in the cockpit are things comparatively realistic and believable, and even there big pills must be swallowed. One of the reasons John Wayne comes off so well in this film is he has relatively little to say. It's probably the lowest line-count of any of Wayne's leading roles, and thus unsaddled with the maudlinities and sappiness of the dialog the passengers are stuck with, he comes off better than anyone in the picture. Spencer Tracy was supposed to play Wayne's role but turned it down (according to various stories) either because he thought the script was lousy or he didn't want to work for taskmaster William Wellman. I'm betting on the former reason.There are still things to like in THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY (Dimitri Tiomkin's Oscar-winning score among them), but an awful lot of people have been waiting forty years to see this ""masterwork"" again, and an awful lot of them are going to be either seriously disappointed or forced to convince themselves that it's not as bad as it seems.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDJkZjIyMTgtYjdlOC00MDY2LTg5MzQtNzc4MmFmMzJjNjRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It doesn't matter that it isn't high satire or even reasonably solid on a technical level because when it comes down to it, some guy sat down one day and decided to make a movie that combined two of the average drunk male's favorite things- zombies and strippers, and ""Zombie Strippers"" doesn't just contain zombies and stripping (actual stripping included, by the way), it goes as far as fulfilling its title and providing a horde of surprisingly sexy... you guessed it, zombie strippers.Commenting on the quality of the direction or the quality of the script with a movie like this just isn't worth it. This movie isn't the worst ever made (that's a fact, sorry), but it is a pretty terrible movie anyway. Could this movie have actually been funny for its jokes? I don't know. Could this ever have been a quality project in the first place? ""Zombie Strippers"" is a movie about zombie strippers. By nature it is going to be pretty darn stupid and pretty darn bad. Using this criteria, ""Zombie Strippers"" is nowhere near as awful as it could have been. I even chuckled a couple of times. The girls all look good too, Jameson being the least attractive, and to think she was the object of every North American man's desire in the 90's (don't go near plastic surgery, girls).

Who can't relate to that sentiment? At school, you have to deal with peer pressure and bullies and, at home, you probably have issues with your siblings and parents who just don't understand. You may be experiencing your first real crush, but not know how to talk to that special someone Ã¢ÂÂ or what you're supposed to do after you manage to have a conversation. You're just starting to figure out who you are as a person, but there's still so much that you're not sure about. You're only beginning to make sense out of life, but you lack the life experience and perspective to understand what's important and what's not. You're confused, frustrated and maybe a little bit lost. You just wish you had someÃÂ someÃÂ control. All this is why the James Patterson novel turned-big-screen-adaptation ""Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life"" (PG, 1:32) is so relatable Ã¢ÂÂ and so fun.Rafe Khatchadorian (Griffin Gluck) is having a rough year. His younger brother died of leukemia, his father has left the family, Rafe's often fighting with his even younger sister, Georgia (Alexa Nisenson), and his mother, Jules (Lauren Graham), is struggling with all of this and dating an obnoxious, two-faced, self-centered guy named Carl (Rob Riggle). Rafe deals with all this through the drawings and imaginative worlds he creates in his sketch book Ã¢ÂÂ and by acting out in school. In fact, Rafe has been expelled from two different schools and is transferring to the last school who will take him. In his new middle school, he really has only one friend, his partner-in-crime, Leo (Thomas Barbusca). Rafe does get along well with his homeroom teacher, Mr. Teller (Adam Pally), and he hopes that one day he can be more than friends with Jeanne (Isabela Moner), the sweet and socially conscious A.V. Club President. Unfortunately, Rafe's more immediate concerns at school are Miller (Jacob Hopkins), the bully who sits right behind him in class, the school's tough and unreasonable Vice Principal, Ida Stricker (Retta) and the strict disciplinarian and completely kid un-friendly, Principal Dwight (Andy Daly, the principal on TV's ""Modern Family"").Principal Dwight only really cares about two things Ã¢ÂÂ his school's continued high scores on an annual achievement test known as the B.L.A.A.R. (Base Line Assessment of Academic Readiness) Ã¢ÂÂ and his long list of school rules which he enforces on his students without compassion. Dwight is the kind of principal who ""welcomes"" a new student by pointing out a slew of dress code violations before the new kid even enters the school for the first time Ã¢ÂÂ and then destroys that same student's treasured sketch book just because some kids were passing it around during a school assembly. At Leo's urging, Rafe decides to get his revenge on Dwight by destroying the principal's book Ã¢ÂÂ his rule book Ã¢ÂÂ as in, making it a goal to literally break every rule in the book, but not get caught. What follows is a series of creative and intricate pranks which inhabit their own Facebook page: ""Rules Aren't For Everyone"". While Rafe is busy with his own brand of ""don't try this at home"" stunts, he's also dealing with an escalating situation between him and Miller, Rafe's growing feelings for Jeanne and the increasingly serious relationship between his mom and Carl, whom he and his sister unflatteringly call ""Bear"".""Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life"" is very enjoyable and surprisingly poignant. While mainly focused on Rafe's complicated family life and his war with his principal, the story works in some subtle criticism of modern trends in education Ã¢ÂÂ and an emotional twist near the end that will shock those who haven't read the book. Daly makes a perfect antagonist (effectively supplemented by Retta's, Riggle's and Hopkins' characters), while Moner is fittingly adorable and Gluck and the other actors who play members of the Khatchadorian family create relatable and sympathetic characters. This cast is full of actors many Movie Fans will recognizeÃÂ and have trouble placing, but they make for a great ensemble.Throughout the movie, there are creative and entertaining animated sequences which bring Rafe's imaginative pen-and-ink creations to life Ã¢ÂÂ and his equally imaginative rule-breaking makes for some great (albeit over-the-top) visuals. Realism isn't the main consideration, but a sense of (relatively) harmless fun is Ã¢ÂÂ and that we get in spades. This story feels like it's actually being told from the perspective of a middle schooler Ã¢ÂÂ and is likely to have a lot of appeal for an audience of the same Ã¢ÂÂ and maybe even for their parentsÃÂ and for the odd movie reviewer who remembers well the trauma of middle school, is happy just to have survived it and would've liked to have been as brave and resourceful as the main characters in this movie.

And that's because he's so utterly convincing as the tortured, bisexual teen genius poet Arthur Rimbaud, that it would undoubtedly set many of those young ladies to wondering if he'd played the part a little TOO well, if you get my meaning. If ever there was any such thing as a male femme fatale, It's Leo right here. Rumor has it that he tried to have the video pulled a few years ago, right after his ""Titanic"" success. It's a good thing he wasn't successful, because I think that this film rates right along with ""The Basketball Diaries"" as possibly his best performance.But it takes two to tango, at least in this case, and David Thewlis is almost as good opposite DiCaprio as Paul Verlaine, who began as Rimbaud's mentor and wound up as his long-time lover. As Verlaine was ugly and overweight, whereas Rimbaud was lithe and handsome, the two seemingly would have made an unbelieveably odd couple physically, but were drawn together more by their mutual likes and dislikes rather than physical attraction. And that's what you sense through all of their scenes together, a meeting of minds more than a meeting of bodies.There were many who praised this movie, there were many who hated it, but love it or hate it, it holds a strange fascination which makes you remember it long after you've seen it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTdiMDEyM2ItOWYzYS00OTM1LWFlYWEtZjdhNWNhNzZmNTQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTIzMzQ1ODg4._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

To clear the family name, he revives the creature and tries to rehabilitate him.","111","A necrophilic family reunion; ""We're all dead here.""","With the runaway success of the re-issue on a double bill of both ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein"" in the late nineteen thirties, Universal Studios decided it was time to resurrect their most lucrative property, the Frankenstein Monster, if the studio was to have any chance of surviving the fiscal year. True to form they originally intended to produce nothing more than a quick cheapie to cash in on the public's renewed interest in horror films. Director Rowland V. Lee had other ideas. He envisioned the film as a modern fairy tale with Frankenstein's Monster as the traditional giant ogre stalking a primordial landscape, and to be sure it is in this film that he first enters the realm of myth. To help achieve this goal he set Jack Otterson to create the most expressionistic sets of any horror film since ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"". The universe of ""Son"" is a world of perpetual night and fog; rain swept castles and blasted heaths; terrifying flashes of lightening; shadowy corridors where giants lurk; hidden passage ways leading to underground crypts, where time, dust and the worm aren't the only things that move among the dead. ""Son of Frankenstein"" is the most visually impressive of all of Universal's horror films and George Robinson's gorgeous black and white cinematography captures every shadow, every out-sized distortion beautifully.This would also be the last time a Frankenstein film would have a script worthy of the subject. Willis Cooper fashioned a contemporary Grimm's fairy tale in which the journey of the film's ""outsiders"", Wolf, Elsa, and Peter will become progressively more nightmarish the deeper they descend; where even breakfast in the morning will be overseen by a pair of monstrous gargoyles. They're journeying by train to inherit the Frankenstein estate, unknown to them a house literally at the edge of Hell, and these opening shots are the most ""normal"" in the entire film. They think of themselves as ""explorers"" and ""exploring something so foreign we can't even imagine what its like."" They speak of the castle being ""haunted"", while outside the window we see through the wind and the rain a gray expanse of desolation and dead trees. ""What a strange country!"" Elsa exclaims. Their passage into the subterranean netherworld of mad doctors, murderous hunchbacks and monsters has begun and will climax in a necrophilic family reunion, (""We're all dead here."") in the Frankenstein crypt, in which both grandfather and father are dead, but the step-brother, the monster and family black sheep is very much alive. ""Do you mean to imply that is my brother?"" Wolf asks. Igor, the true Frankenstein family retainer replies, ""Only his mother was the lightening."" And it is Wolf's voyage from arrogance and ignorance, (""Why should we fear anything!"") to humility and wisdom, (""Never in my life have I known cold fear until that moment I felt his hand on my shoulder!"") which is central to the film.While the film is a follow up to ""Bride of Frankenstein"", it very much stands on its own. Gone are any references to the Bride and Dr, Praetorious, both presumably ""blown to atoms"" at the climax of that film. Also the monster doesn't speak. All traces of speech, at Karloff's insistence were eliminated. The portrait of Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein dominates the castle's study, and recalls the earlier films. In the scenes on the train Wolf refers to the, ""Blunder of a stupid assistant who gave his father's creation the brain of a killer instead of a normal one."" This is of course, a direct reference to the first film. Karloff's return to his greatest role completes the linking of the three films. And consistent with the impressive visuals, the Monster is given his most striking look. Gone is the distinctly twentieth century black garb so beloved of the Universal Frankenstein films. Instead the Monster is clothed in a crude sheepskin jersey, with heavy shirt and trousers stitched together with strips of leather. Indeed, his whole appearance has become that of a giant, an ogre out of Grimm or Perrault. He even gets the traditional giant's club in the form of Krogh's wooden arm at the film's climax. As if to underscore this, Peter gives the Monster a present-a storybook of fairy tales!The film may have the greatest horror film cast ever. There is Karloff dominating as the Monster. Given less screen time than in the previous film, his scenes are still among his most powerful. To cite just two examples, the scene where he rises like Lucifer out of the pit is like an image from Dante's Inferno while his primal howl of grief upon discovering the dead Igor is one of the Monster's greatest moments from any of the Frankenstein films. Bela Lugosi easily has his best role after Dracula as the broken neck, hunchback, Igor. Creepy, roguish, even pitiable, one is reminded of what a fine actor he could be with a role worthy of his talent. Lionel Atwill with his beautifully clipped vocal delivery and sardonic sense of humor has his definitive screen role as the one arm Inspector Krogh; he doesn't miss any opportunity for scene stealing bits of business with that wooden arm. And there is Basil Rathbone as Wolf. He doesn't have Karloff's make-up or Lugosi's broken neck or Atwill's wooden arm, but he gives a full-blooded commanding performance that refuses to get lost in this who's who of cinematic ghouls. William K. Everson once said that only a truly great actor can get away with a little deliberate ham now and then, and if Rathbone is a little over the top, it is ham well seasoned and served and adds enormously to the enjoyment of the film. Finally Frank Skinner's incredible film score would set the standard for Universal's horror films for the next decade.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDdjNzJiOTgtMGE2Ni00NDFkLTliYjItZWQzZGQ5NTg1Y2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc5NjEzNA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

This thought-provoking film explores a world where advanced robotics has revolutionized household chores, introducing the 'Maid Droid'-a mechanized marvel designed to make everyday tasks a breeze.At first glance, the film appears to offer a utopian vision of domestic life, as the titular Maid Droid effortlessly whirs through chores, tending to each task with precision and grace. The result is a meticulously clean and orderly home, seemingly devoid of the chaos and messiness of human existence. The visuals are sleek, depicting a world that is both alluringly futuristic and eerily sterile.However, as the film unfolds, a disconcerting undercurrent emerges. The protagonist, a skeptical homeowner, gradually becomes uneasy with the perfect faÃÂ§ade presented by the Maid Droid. A series of inexplicable events begin to unfold-objects misplaced, unsettling noises heard in the night, and a growing feeling of isolation within the once-hospitable walls of the home.The tension mounts as the protagonist delves deeper into the Maid Droid's programming, uncovering disturbing secrets that challenge the very nature of artificial intelligence. The film deftly navigates the ethical and existential questions raised by technology's encroachment into the most intimate aspects of human life. Is the Maid Droid truly just a tool, or does it harbor intentions beyond its programming? Can a machine designed to serve develop a sense of agency?The performances by the cast, particularly the homeowner and their interactions with the Maid Droid, are engaging and thought-provoking. As the narrative builds, the sense of unease is masterfully intensified through clever cinematography and a haunting score that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.""Maid Droid"" ultimately challenges viewers to reflect on the consequences of unchecked technological advancement and the potential loss of human connection in an increasingly automated world. It serves as a cautionary tale, reminding us that while convenience is a desirable goal, it must be balanced with an understanding of the boundaries between human and machine.In conclusion, ""Maid Droid"" successfully blends elements of science fiction, psychological thriller, and existential drama to create an engaging cinematic experience. It's a film that leaves audiences pondering the impact of technology on our lives long after the credits roll, and it serves as a timely reminder that even in a world dominated by machines, the human spirit remains as enigmatic and fragile as ever.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YwOTZiZTItNjRlMy00ZDlhLTliMWEtZDcyODFjNmVkMTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzM1MDM3MDA@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"
"Marshall","1997.0","16","118.0","Biography, Crime, Drama","7.3","66.0","Reginald Hudlin","Chadwick Boseman, Josh Gad, Kate Hudson, Sterling K. Brown","26,857","The story ofThurgood Marshall, the crusading lawyer who would become the first African-American Supreme Court Justice, as he battles through one of his career-defining cases.","91","Thurgood 101","Greetings again from the darkness. The question must be asked: is the movie worthy of the man? The man was the first attorney for the NAACP. He won 29 of the 32 cases he argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, including the ground-breaking 1954 Brown v. Board of Education (separate but equal public education). This man was a trailblazer for Civil Rights, and in 1967 became the first African- American Supreme Court Justice. This man was, of course, Thurgood Marshall ÃÂ a man who unquestionably deserves not just a movie, but a really good and important one.Chadwick Boseman has taken on film versions of such icons as Jackie Robinson in 42 and James Brown in GET ON UP, so he likely jumped at the chance to play the revered figure, Thurgood Marshall. Mr. Boseman has true movie star screen presence, and supplies the young Mr. Marshall with a self-assured swagger that accompanies a brilliant legal mind Ã¢ÂÂ a mind that refused to be ignored during a time it was desperately needed. Lest he be labeled a superhero, the film does portray Marshall smoking and drinking, while also hinting at his carousing. The common flaws of a great man.It's 1941 and the young (33 years old) Marshall is the lone NAACP attorney, so he spends his time ping-ponging around the country fighting for fair trials for those African-Americans accused simply because they aren't white. He works only for ""innocent"" people and his efforts during this time were crucial to the Civil Rights movement gaining attention and legitimacy. Most of the film centers on a case in Connecticut (no, not the Jim Crow south) where a black man, Joseph Spell (Sterling K Brown), is accused of sexual assault of a ""respectable"" married white woman, Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson). If you are reminded of the great book and film TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, you must know that those literary and cinematic standards are such that few can ever hope to reach. What follows is not one of the more dramatic or tension-filled cinematic courtroom dramas. There is simply too much levity for the film to be classified as a historical heavyweight. That said, the man and his story are fascinating, and though director Reginald Hudlin chooses a deft touch rather than a sledge hammer, it's likely the wise choice if the goal is to entertain, while also educating the masses to Marshall's early career. Josh Gad co-stars as Marshall's co-counsel Sam Friedman, a specialist in legal technicalities within the insurance industry. Boseman and Gad have nice chemistry (at times it feels like a buddy movie), and as a Jew in those times, Friedman is himself stuck in limbo between staunch racism and acceptance by the white community. James Cromwell plays Judge Foster, yet another man caught between the old world he has lived in his entire life and the fast-changing society and legal system that permits him to silence Marshall, while also forcing (somewhat) fair treatment of the accused Spell. Dan Stevens (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST) is Loren Willis, the disgusted and disgusting prosecutor. This character is so cartoonish that the only thing missing is a neon necklace that flashes ""racist"" as he speaks. Sophia Bush has a brief, yet important scene and Sterling K Brown (as Mr. Spell) has the film's most heart-breaking moment as he sits on the stand and explains why he lied. Director Reginald Hudlin seems like an odd choice for the project. He has been working mostly in TV since back-to-back-to-back bombs BOOMERANG (Eddie Murphy), THE LADIES MAN (Tim Meadow) and SERVING SARA (Matthew Perry). Mr. Hudlin has experienced more success as a Producer, having been Oscar nominated for DJANGO UNCHAINED. Here he works with the father and son screenwriters Jacob Koskoff and Michael Koskoff. The elder Michael is a well respected criminal attorney and legal historian, and certainly understands the expectations that come with offering a public look at a near- mythical figure ÃÂ especially one as revered as Thurgood Marshall.This isn't so much a movie about the icon as it is about a young man on the path to greatness and importance (he served on the Supreme Court from 1967-1991). The soundtrack is filled with jazz which complements the light-hearted approach, and further distances from any semblance of ""heavy"" or ""historical"". Director Hudlin adds a contemporary touch by having Trayvon Martin's parents (Sybrina Fulton, Tracy Martin) appear in a scene near the end. On the downside, multiple upshot camera angles are designed to make his lead character look larger than life. The truth is, Thurgood Marshall required no help in looming large. Hopefully this mainstream approach pays off and many are introduced to the legacy of a man who is more than worthy of this movie ÃÂ and another.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzg3YTc4N2ItZmZkZS00OWE1LWIyNGMtNzYzZWQzMzVkZWI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTQ3MjE4NTU@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The only movie I could actually relate to up until now was ""All Over Me"" If you haven't seen it...go rent it!! Loving Annabelle is such a straightforward love story that fortunately doesn't involve lesbian circus performers or travelin' hippie painters.

Now, now yes it was HOT but I loved it because like the movie, it to was straightforward, passionate, necessary.

I give this movie 2 thumbs way up for giving me something I can relate to, for being such a straightforward story about love, letting go, putting happiness first, etc.Now as an added bonus, since it was the premiere I was able to nervously chat with writer/director Katherine Brooks and the 2 leads (ALL HOT by the way) and they were all so super cool so it makes the movie that much more enjoyable","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTY2MGY1YWQtNzJkMi00Yjg4LTg3ZTgtYmZjNWUxMjI3MDdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg3MTIwODI@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I found myself looking at Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara as a very well rounded person. Not as an ideological self fulfilling man but as an articulate man with thought out rational decisions as well as a man with many useful talents.The acting of the cast all around was very good but Benicio Del Toro took the movie by storm but he did this in a very subtle way. His performance displayed how Che's spirit was able to superseded the hardships faced in the Cuban Revolution. It did not display any brutality or recklessness but a devotion to a cause. Del Toro's perforations was that worthy of an Oscar nomination but I don't think Che Guervara cared to much about awards.The directing by Steven Soderbergh was visually stunning at times with much of the scenes shot in the forest. What kept the movie upbeat though were the scenes of Che in New York giving interviews and addressing the U.N. It added an extra layer to the film allowing you to see another side of Che. The side in which he shows his political and speaking abilities. The writing was very good with the dialog always keeping you engrossed. The music, though not much of it, was very good and stayed within rhythm of the rest of the film.Overall the film succeeds in showing Che as a well rounded man never developing into oversimplified or unnecessarily complex portrayal of a man. The movie was very accurate and refused to take on a role of being inspiring or Hollywoodish which I enjoyed. The only problem with the film I had was that it seems to have a little too much of a feel of a war film rather than a biopic. Still I highly recommend this film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2JiNjE4YjItNTFhNS00ZmYyLWEwNzctNzJmYzNiYWYzOGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"
"Perdita Durango","1997.0","R","129.0","Action, Crime, Horror","6.3","","ÃÂlex de la Iglesia","Rosie Perez, Javier Bardem, Harley Cross, Aimee Graham","9,870","A psychotic criminal couple kidnaps a random teenage couple. The woman rapes the male captive, and lets him watch his lover being raped by the man. They then plan to sacrifice the couple.","69","Another overlooked gem...","Right after the success of his masterpiece, the dark comedy ""El Dia De la Bestia"", Spanish director Alex De la Iglesia took a stab at Hollywood with this wild ride of marvelous insanity and bizarre entertainment. Sadly, the resulting movie was severely cut in the U.S. and the U.K. and didn't had the expected results as many labeled as another Tarantino-style film. While at first sight ""Perdita Durango"" indeed looks like a rip off of the movies by the Tarantino-Rodriguez tandem, this really black comedy is more a witty satire than a serious action flick.The film is the story of Perdita Durango (Rosie Perez), a young criminal who one night meets Romeo Dolorosa (Javier Bardem), a crazed priest of an extreme form of Santeria who makes a life doing jobs for the mob. They fall in love and Perdita comes along in Romeo's latest job: the traffic of human fetuses for the cosmetic industry. On their trip, they kidnap two American teenagers for Romeo's human sacrifices. However, things go wrong as a DEA agent (James Gandolfini) follows them closely and the kidnapped teens try to escape.Based on Barry Gifford's novel of the same name, the movie follows the criminal couple's adventure in the style of a road trip movie with the two couples (the criminals and their victims) as main characters. I can't tell how faithful the movie is to the novel, but it is definitely closer to Gifford's previous film adaptation, David Lynch's ""Wild at Heart"" than to the Tarantino films that are often compared to it. The movie is charged with black humor and disturbing violence, and is a brilliant satire of modern society.Alex De la Iglesia crafts a film that is at the same time disturbing and funny, and he plays with those two very different emotions with very good results. The pacing of the movie is very good although it is true that at times it feels a bit disjointed. Still, De la Iglesia manages to tell an intelligent and different story than what we are used to. On a side note, the edited A-Pix version is missing what is probably the most important moment of the film due to copyright troubles, so to fully appreciate the film, the 125 version is the way to go.The acting is good for the most part, with Javier Bardem showing exactly why is he considered the best Spanish actor of his generation; his Romeo Delarosa is one of the best performances of his career. Rosie Perez is effective, but at times it feels as if she weren't up to the challenge, something that hurts the film badly, as she is the main character. Harley Cross and Aimee Graham are very believable as the kidnapped teens and show potential for comedy, but the real joy comes from supporting actors Gandolfini and a surprising Screamin' Jay Hawkins.Personally, I liked the film a lot and it is a personal favorite, but I must be fair and point out that it is not a perfect film. Alex De la Iglesia's main mistake is to focus too much on Romeo Delarosa's character, almost to the point where Rosie Perez almost becomes a supporting actress. The fact that Bardem's acting is enormously superior doesn't really help Perez' performance. On another point, the movie seems to lose steam at the last point, and while it does recover some of its initial power, the edited versions definitely take out this final improvement.As written above, this is a personal favorite, and while I wouldn't recommend it to everybody (due to its disturbing images), I would definitely recommend it to fans of black comedies, disturbing thrillers and overall bizarre film-making in general. 8/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExOGUxZTUtNWYzMi00Y2Q3LWFlOGQtZTc4YTFkYTNkNjQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzgzODI1OTE@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

A film is advertised as Elvises robbing a Las Vegas casino during an Elvis convention.  How much more lead in do you want? You expect, action, thrills and ... content?  Amazing.  Listen.  This is one of the funniest, outrageous films I've seen in a long time. Yes.  The story's incredible.  But, in any film, we have to consider the level at which we're willing to ""buy in.""  I mean, some people were outraged at the farting scenes in Shrek.  Now, they're complaining because Russell and Costner-- especially the latter-- are too violent.  Well, let's go back a year or so when Russell and Costner both made Wyatt Earp films, playing the title roles.  From my view, both vehicles were ghastly but entertaining. So, I submit that what we have here is the COSTNER and RUSSELL Revenge vehicle.  Costner is always on the leafy edge, whether he's dancing with wolves, building baseball fields for ghosts or water-skiing as bait for sea monsters.  Russell, whose track record in shoot 'em-ups is no less than Stallone or Arnie, is likewise coming off some hound dog roles, such as being an automated soldier, a remake of his Escape from New York (LA?  Why'd anyone want to go there in the first place?) and the sci-fi Stargate.  Now, we get these two guys in a mindless, black comedy, full of S&V-- the most since the cult film Thursday-- with quirky twists and turns.  Mindless violence? Yes.  Gratuitious sex? Yes.  Entertaining?  Yes-- but only if you don't take it too seriously.  I loved it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExMDA0NDAyOTReQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDM4ODg3OQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

As his wife heals, Matt's sanity unravels, facing terrifying consequences.","2","Decent enough for what it is","Trying to care for his dying wife, a husband willing to do whatever he can to care for her finds a controversial method that could potentially save her only to be unaware of the true cost it will take on him to do so, and as he condition unravels he finds the cost eating away at his sanity.This was a fairly solid effort overall. One of the better elements present here is the genuinely likable and sympathetic storyline that takes place here which brings everything into play. Getting enough of a backstory on his wife's condition that has been going on throughout the first half where the outcome of her condition affects both his way of life and their relationship together where the debilitating sickness that has him running his life taking care of her as well as the medical professionals trying to help take care of her makes for a great starting point. The implication towards using the black magic means to try to help out further is thus ably explained and has enough logical implications that it feels introduced quite nicely into this setup as a result. That setup allows for the more genuinely chilling genre elements to have a solid baseline to work with going forward. After this drama-centric approach. Knowing the truth about what's going on with the boost in health due to this strange ritual he performed and how it correlates to the strange figure he sees hanging around the two of them, these scenes manage to generate a rather fine air of unease between them. Being unable to tell her what's happening as the visuals and sudden appearance of the figure freak him out despite knowing the rules to the situation, the way the figure begins taunting and tormenting him to drive him over the edge creates a highly unnerving scenario the more this plays out, managing to provide this one with some fine positive points throughout here. There are some issues with this one that holds it down. The main drawback present with the film is the excessively overlong running time for this type of story that, despite not appearing egregious in the general sense, is still way too long for the type of story being presented. With far too much of the first half devoted to the relationship issues struggling with the condition she has and the care required to control it, it makes for a somewhat bland time waiting around for something to happen with the specifics of the ritual hidden so that it has a central idea but the general means it works kept away until the end. That also causes the second half to be incredibly redundant and repetitive watching him go through the same thing over and over again knowing full well that the whole thing is supposed to take place in a specific way which he's ignoring. This does tend to undo a lot of the positive points and hold it down overall.Rated Unrated/R: Language and Violence.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NmI3MjYtMGYyNy00NzZkLWJjNzgtODQzM2RiYThmZWE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTMzOTMzMTg@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The film barely got anywhere while maintaining an incredibly slow pace and irritating visual style consisting of incessantly restrained deep-focus cinematography. There was so much potential wasted on scenes far too peculiar and insignificant to add any depth to the story or further develop the characters. Seldom did anything rightfully earn its place in the film; the multiple sex scenes seemed to be there with the sole purpose of being extremely awkward and obscene, while all the attempts at absurd humor felt slightly forced and weren't as effective as they should have been due to the narrative's intermittent solemnity.This brings me to the film's greatest problem, which was thatÃ¢ÂÂ on top of struggling to find its own voice and tone in its ridiculously irrational approachÃ¢ÂÂ it never really figured out what message it wanted to convey to its audience. Evidently Lanthimos was trying to say something about human nature and the craziness of consumer society, but he didn't succeed in delivering his thoughts coherently this time around. I hate comparing, but I must say I found the profound social critique that seeped through the bizarre surface of ""Dogtooth"" to be far superior in elaboration.The end result of ""Alps"" was a confused, detached (albeit well-acted, especially by Aggeliki Papoulia) jumble beyond anyone's realm of comprehension, so overwhelmingly filled with unjustified senselessness that the most I could do was simply sit and stare at the screen, patiently awaiting some real substance, only to be disappointed by sheer staleness.I suppose I somewhat admired ""Alps"" for all that it could've been following its eccentric uniqueness, but I can't see how anyone in their right mind could have truly enjoyed it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3NTk4ODI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzE1Mzg4Nw@@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I usually only see movies of a more sophisticated, thought provoking quality during its first week in theaters. I was in the mood for some stress relieving comedy and after seeing the trailer, I thought this movie would do the trick. It's almost as if they went through the entire film and pulled out every funny part (believe me, they are just that few) and used them for the preview. I probably laughed only two times during the entire film. Everything else was either already shown in the preview (so it was no longer funny) or so stupid that it didn't even deserve a laugh.This film totally lacks creativity and, with the exception of all the gross and tacky sexual references, looks as if it were written by a 4th grader (seriously). The only thing truly laughable about this film is the film itself - It's a Big Joke - and The Joke Is On Us!! (the paying viewers). Who did they think their audience would be - Cavemen!? I hate to take it to that extreme, but the script is just that simple. I wasn't necessarily expecting it to be a great movie (I mean, it is supposed to be a comedy), but since Malcolm D. Lee wrote the Best Man (a very enjoyable film), I thought this movie would at least be worthy of my time and money. Boy, was I wrong. Lee obviously has no real friends, because if he did, they would have told him this project was a load of garbage. I'm still amazed that he was able to secure James Earl Jones' participation in this movie. I am sure he'll still make money because many people will go to see it (with false hopes of a comic relief), but for those of you reading this....I'd recommend waiting for the DVD - or better yet, why not just wait for a movie that is actually deserving of your attention.

Director Luis Mandoki knows how to pile on the tension to this chilling premise, delivering genuine suspense and thrills every minute without losing momentum. The story even holds a few decent surprises that caught me slightly off-guard, if not necessarily shocked.As well-tuned as the direction was, what impressed me the most were the performances. The central story focuses on Theron and Bacon, and both make for one of the more effective protagonist/antagonist duos in recent memory. Dakota Fanning also shines as the kidnapped daughter; this is one of the best performances from a child actor all year (the other is from Fanning herself in the miniseries Taken). Stuart Townsend and Courtney Love aren't as effective as Theron and Bacon, but come through with solid performances.Trapped is still a very flawed movie, considering the script is hardly original and the subject matter itself is a little unsavory and disturbing. The tit-for-tat matches between kidnapper and hostage can get a little repetitive, but the fact that it revolves around three pairings does add more tension to the proceedings. Still, the movie nicely builds to its thrilling conclusion, a climactic sequence that is a bit overdone but nonetheless exciting. It's a pity Trapped was ignored at the box office, since it's easily far superior to recent similarly plotted kidnapped thrillers such as Don't Say a Word or Along Came a Spider.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjc3YzMwMmEtMTZlOS00M2U5LWFiMDctNmZhNzU3ZWU2YmVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0NTI0Nw@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The beauty of it is, you will find someone you know. If you haven't tricked yourself into thinking this might be like Christmas Vacation or Planes, Trains and Automobiles, then I hope you can appreciate its evenly paced, nostalgia filled beauty.De Niro has outdone himself with this simple heart-filled ""grown family"" film. I can truthfully say I liked him more in this than anything else he has done, although I also believe he probably didn't have to dig too deep into his soul to be Frank Goode. I will be surprised if he has not turned the heads and hearts of those who can nominate him for an Oscar. While all the characters were easy to relate to, this movie was more about Frank Goode's journey from state to state and through life.Believe me, Everybody's Fine is more than just fine.9/10 and one giant hug for everyone involved in making this beautiful film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NzEwNzA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE0NjAyMw@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Eventually they develop a romantic and affectionate relationship.","78","Love can be found anywhere......","I saw ""Breezy"" last night on the Universal HD channel. I hadn't seen it since the '70s when I saw the TV version. One would expect to enjoy a film such as ""Star Wars"" in HD-you wouldn't immediately think that a film like ""Breezy"" would benefit from this treatment. However, the crystal-clarity of the presentation brings back the look of Southern California of the early Seventies in all of its glory that can only really be appreciated by those who lived here back then. Seeing the locations in Topanga Canyon, Malibu, and the Valley; the hippies, the straights in their suits and ties, and the way the Generation Gap (back in the day when there REALLY was one) is treated is definitely a trip down memory lane.Anyone who has ever had a love that has dissolved into sadness with the passing of time (most of us) can fully relate to this film. This is a story about a young woman who has so much to share: her exuberance, her unique way of looking at the world, her evolving femininity, her inner and outer beauty. It's also about a powerful and successful man who is at the crossroads in his life. It is a film is about two people that, for a brief moment, are able to look beyond the constraints of societal disapproval and just simply appreciate what the other has to give.When I first saw this film, I was the same age as Breezy. Now thirty three years later, I'm getting close to Frank's age. Nobody prepares you for the passing of time. They don't teach you how to handle it in school, there's no handbook that you can refer to as the years slip away. No, the greatest challenge in life is something you can't prepare for, you can only live through it, and each person's journey is different from the rest. In that aspect, this film is a wise and knowing look at real life. Sure, there's some stilted dialogue, and some of the scenes are a bit too predictable. but if you scratch the surface, you'll find a diamond underneath.I am fortunate to be able to say that I see Kay Lenz frequently. I'd like everyone to know that she still has a unique beauty that is greatly unaffected by the passing of the years. Sure, she's not twenty anymore, but who is? She has an easy, graceful way about her that is a pleasure to experience, and just hearing her angelic voice, which has changed only slightly through the years, brings me back to that world of beach walks, undeveloped L.A. canyons, and six bedroom houses in the Valley that cost $88,000 (!!). For you non-actors out there, remember, Kay was playing a role. Breezy was a character, not a real person. However, if you were smitten with that character, you would not be disappointed to see the real Kay today. If anything, she is even more endearing in 2006 than she was in 1973.Let's face it folks, growing old stinks. Falling out of love is even worse. This film handles both of these issues with a grace and acceptance that is missing from most of the films made about these themes. I truly believe that there is something in this film for all who care to look for it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE2ZDIxNGYtM2MxMS00ZDEzLWE2ZjktNDdiOTE1NmUwNzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I actually am still wondering how it got through the Censor Board without taking out the stuff that I saw. If this movie has an uncensored version, I would buy it in the blink of an eye.I am quite ecstatic that Aamir has branched out from the typical movies he produces to invest in something so uncanny.

Influential concept which shaped style of Giallo films from 1970s-1980s and American Slasher subgenre of 1980s. Mario Bava filmed each murder sequence in their own distinct flavor.  Blood and Black Lace(1964) is an example of making every death scene in a body count pic memorable.  Years later, Mario Bava did another body count driven giallo in Reazione a Catena/Bay of Blood(1971) which surpasses this giallo in number of death moments.  Mario Bava was an innovator in horror and general cinema whose visual style continues to influence.Blood & Black Lace(1964) offered audiences in early 1960s a candy coding spectacle of death and violence.  A positive is the lack of a moral preaching which is a major weakness of the American Slasher film.  Adult orienated horror film which thankfully lacks the basic elements of a Teenage Slasher film.  Follows in steps of Grand Guignol, and theater of cruelty theater forms.  Death moments are filmed in Grand Guignol style with physical intensity.  Theater of Cruelty influence is based on film's preference of metaphysical and mise-en-scene forms over motives of character and psychology.The first murder which takes place during opening moments is an intense preview of things to come.  Murder of Nicole includes colorful setting and stylish weapon.  Peggy's death scene begins with build up sympathy for character.  Forth murder sequence concludes with macabre modeling image. Tao Li's death beings in abrupt fashion and features erotic elements.  The sixth and final murder sequence is the most tragic of them all.Greed is main reason behind murders in the story.  The rich are unsympatheticly depicted by Bava as being decadent and selfish.  Greed is a driving force for most of Bava's characters who barely care for anything else.  I think of film as part of an informal trilogy which I call Greed trilogy.  Greed trilogy consists of Sei Donne Per L'Assassino/Blood and Black Lace(1964), 5 Bambole per la Luna D'Agosto/5 Dolls for an August Moon(1970), and Reazione a Catena/Bay of Blood(1971).  River of greed in Bava's films results only in death and tragedy.Mario Bava paints many scenes in gorgeous technicolor process.  He exercises different colors in Blood and Black Lace(1964) with flamboyant vision. Colors of blue, black, green, purple, red, and yellow are used to represent different types of predictaments.  Bava's expertise as cinematographer and painter is a plus in the film's look.  Scene in antique shop is a lesson on how to film something in extravagant colors.  There are few filmmakers out there with exception of Dario Argento and Martin Scorsese who are able to incorporate color into film with artistic flair like Mario Bava was able to do.Suspense in murder sequences is manufactured via extreme colors and physical intensity.  Bava depicts an aura of paranoia and suspicion as a result of photographing scenes with extreme use of colors.  He detaches himself from identifying with murderer by showing face in a white blank.  In photographing sequences with visual flair, Mario Bava treats the viewer to a large helping of voluptuous desert.  I consider film to be director's most sightly color photographed giallo.  Blood & Black Lace(1964) stands out in giallo genre because of artistic touch and visceral flamboyance.On the surface, the Haute Couture Fashion House is a place of idealized beauty and social priviledge.  Under the facade however, reveals a backdrop of aristocratic decay, blackmail, drugs, murder, and sex.  Deception is a motif which frequents the art and cinema of Mario Bava.  Bava presents aristocratic society in film as heartless and selfish.  They live in their own isolated environment with concerns only for sensual pleasures, power, and wealth.  Aristocrats in Blood and Black Lace(1964) and other Bava films appears to be patterned after Mussolini regime.Effect on Italian horror was slow but reached cinematic importance with emergence of Dario Argento's Bird with the Crystal Plumage in 1969.  Sei Donne Per L'Assassino(1964) is considered to be the first full blown giallo in Italian cinema.  Landmark film filled with elements which became staples of giallo and slasher cinema.  Part of the film's brilliance is its flamboyant visual style and flair for the macabre.  Director's other landmark horror picture in his career was influential Bay of Blood(1971). Blood & Black Lace(1964) blends in elements of giallo and noir with perfect fusion.There are interesting allusions to Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity(1944) during second half.  Relationship between Massimo and Countess Christina shares comparisons with relationship between Walter and Mrs. Dietrichson in Double Indemnity(1944).  Last scene is an updated take off of final moments in Whip and the Body(1963).  Very good performances are given by Cameron Mitchell and Eva Bartok who play their parts well characterized by detachment and passion.  Bava did a variation of fashion world in another giallo called Il Rosso Segno Della Follia/Hatchet for the Honeymoon(1969). Red Diary is a wonderful plot device used again in Bay of Blood(1971).Luciano Pigozzi earns the title of Italian Peter Lorre with Lorrish and sinister presence.  Death of Peggy via hot stove was slightly cut especially in moment when face is pulled off to reveal it to be destroyed and steaming. Moment was cut due to being too graphic in its time and has never appeared in any print of Blood and Black Lace(1964).  Heroes are almost non existent in Mario Bava's universe and Sei Donne Per L'Assassino(1964) is no exception.  Tightly directed and nicely edited with wonderful trashy jazz film score by Carlos Rustichelli.  What it lacks in gore is made up with physical and visual intensive drive.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA3MjgwMzQ2MjBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDY5NTIyODMx._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The trailers show nothing except the little monster growing quickly and swimming around happily. What I did not expect is the wonderful, and entertaining background story set in Scotland during WWII. Now the film has a modern frame as well as the WWII story. An old man tells two young visitors to Loch Ness what they assume is a tall tale. Frames usually don't add much to movies but in this frame is an exception.In WWII a young boy, who doesn't know his father was lost at sea, finds a strange egg. While the egg grows into a likable, gigantic plesiosaur, a strange man, who might be a German spy, starts as caretaker of the boy's father's estate, and a gunnery unit takes over the estates grounds. The captain of the gunnery unit takes a shine to the boy's Mom, and tries to instill discipline to the boy by treating him like a drill sergeant would a recruit. Meanwhile, the new caretaker decides to keep the boy's new pet a secret. and wins the respect of the boy's mother. Although there is no real violence in this movie there is a killer (hunter) cook and some shooting. In fact there is a scene with cannon fire that might scare young children. And of course the cook has a tough bull-dog who likes to chase things. The characters here are well developed and the acting and cinematography is superb.

To merely recount the violence that human beings are capable of perpetuating against each other makes for transgressive reflection rather than a useful one, because it denies us hope. Sobibor passes Ebert's test: From the first scene to the last, the horrors of the Holocaust are contrasted against the humanity of its victims and the courage that they ultimately find to rise up and fight back. It helps that the Sobibor camp is more cinematically satisfying, as it represents one of the only successful uprisings in concentration camps - 400 prisoners successfully escaped, led by Russian soldier Alexander Pechersky, and the third act breakout generates genuine tension as the heroes slowly begin to implement a plan that begins with individual acts of violence and ends with a convincing revolution. It is one of the great prison-breaks in the movies, made all the more jaw-dropping when the closing scroll reminds us that it is all true. In contract, Inglorious Basterds (a great film) had to create a fantasy ending that was as emotionally satisfying as the history featured in Sobibor.  The scenes leading up to the escape depict the daily lives of both soldiers and prisoners within the camp, in both its banalities and horrors, and there are some truly gory and disturbing moments here, but they never feel unnecessary because of the way that lead actor/director Konstaintin Khabenskiy depicts these events through the eyes of the prisoners who, slowly but surely, refuse to be victims any longer. Khabenskiy makes for a dogged and convincing hero, but it is Christopher Lambert's depiction of Karl Frenzel, the Nazi administrator of the camp, that really elevates the film's tension-Lambert plays the part as a man barely holding onto his sanity, having internalized the suffering that he constantly orders and witnesses. It is the most chilling portrait of an unhinged Nazi official since Ralpph Fiennes in Schindler's List. Less successful is Khabenskiy's decision to suggest a romantic connection between Pechersky and a female prisoner that he knew before the war, mainly because I struggled to believe an opportunity for such a romance convincing in this setting; nevertheless, this relationship is well-acted and leads to one of the best character exchanges in the film.  Sobibor is the Russian submission for the 91st Academy Award for best foreign language film. The film was shot in Lithuania, in six languages: Russian, Polish, German, Dutch, Yiddish, and English. This helps give the film the epic scope of a truly international production, and that is exactly what it feels like. This is one of the best films centered on the theme of the Holocaust that I have ever seen-well-acted, handsomely stages, filled with sobering imagery, and ultimately, a satisfying resolution that makes an often difficult journey worth taking. What begins as a tragedy ends as a victory; the film's success, and whether or not we accept the set-up of the first two acts, hinges on the execution of the escape. Khabenskiy absolutely delivers. I would be very happy to see this film appear on the list of nominees.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU4ZGEyYjAtYmE0Ny00NzNmLTgzODAtNmU3YmRmODMwN2Q2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDM1ODc2NzE@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Next time I was 25 and was bowled over by its imagery, and as I've got older come to appreciate it more and more.So much for watching it through a child's eyes and accepting the fantasy at face value! At the beginning Cocteau states ""Once upon a time..."", but really for discerning adult cineastes (and/or poets) to drop their guards and enjoy it for what it was - a magical filmic fantasy. It's uniformly marvellous in all departments, direction, photography, acting, music, design, and Cocteau trotted out all his favourite cinematic tricks - just part of the sequence between Blood of a Poet in '30 and Testament of Orphee in '61. The script was suitably steeped in non sequiteurs and puzzles to add to the heaviness of it all. Er, not that it matters but what happened to Ludovic?The wonderful dark brooding smoky atmosphere is the most important aspect though - there are few films I've seen with such a powerful cinematic atmosphere, Reinhardt's Midsummer Night's Dream is one and Dead of Night another etc. But the romantic melancholic atmosphere here was something ... incredible. It was only possible with black and white nitrate film stock to capture such gleaming, glistening and time- and place-evoking moving images - it hasn't been quite the same since 1950 with safety film in use.If you're an adult about to give it your first (let yourself) go, I envy thee!

Oh, and it made Humphrey Bogart a major star while it was at it.  Therefore, I'm not entirely sure that your film collection, if you have one, can survive without it.Based on a pulpy novel, it chronicles the story of Roy Earle, sprung from a life sentence in prison so that he can knock over a casino along the California-Nevada border.  It's easy to miss, but notice the first minute of this picture closely:  it's of course the Governor -- bought off by a mobster -- who gets Roy released from his life sentence, indicating that the corruption has finely infested the top of the social order.  This is the usual tough-minded, whistle-blowing gangster-picture stuff that Warner Bros. specialized in.  But there's also something else at work here, perhaps something new:  one gets the sense that what happens to Roy in this movie has been engineered from On High, in advance . . . in other words, he's in the Jaws of Fate.  And thus we're in the unforgiving world of Film Noir.More than the opening scene, it's Bogart who almost single-handedly invents film noir with his groundbreaking work in  *High Sierra*.  Not cocky like Cagney and Muni, not psychopathic like the early Edward G. Robinson, not as smooth as Raft, Bogart is a ruthless professional with a wide stripe of sentimentality.  His Roy never shirks from killing, but he doesn't get off on it.  He's more a rebel than a gangster, a poetic soul denied respectability, a man longing for the innocence of his youth. Unfortunately, he thinks he finds in the personage of a transplanted Okie farm-girl  (Joan Leslie)  a reasonable facsimile of that innocence. Competing for his affections is Ida Lupino, a sour  ""dime-a-dance girl"" who's been up, down, and around the block a time or three.  She's the baggage that comes with the two new-generation hoods whom Bogart is assigned to babysit for the casino heist.  Not until later in the picture does Bogart recognize Lupino's better suitability to his own temperament and experience. (They share in common, among other things, suicidal impulses, a desire to escape a corrupted world.)Roy Earle was a new type of character -- the truly romantic criminal. Bogart would play variations on Earle throughout his career, though he rarely exceeded his triumph here.  And while I've given the actor much of the credit, some more credit must be extended to the screenwriter, John Huston.  *High Sierra*  was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.Oh, and did I mention that the movie -- aside from its importance in American film history, yadda yadda -- is quite simply a good time?  Witty dialogue, great on-location direction by Raoul Walsh, a cute dog, and a climactic car chase that wouldn't be equaled until 1968's  *Bullitt*, are just some of this movie's other virtues.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzg2MzBjNWUtMDgyZS00ZWFmLTljMDEtZmUxMTEwNGM4M2RlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The United States was just climbing out of its worst postwar recession, while Japan was enjoying an unprecedented industrial boom. Manufacturing industries were still a significant part of the US economy, and factory workers were a good example of the ""average American"". The word ""downsizing"" hadn't entered the general vocabulary yet, but everyone knew the phenomenon. Bruce could be heard on the radio singing, ""Foreman says these jobs are going, boy, and they ain't coming back to your hometown."" Chrysler had just been bailed out by Uncle Sam. Bumper stickers could be seen saying ""Buy American -- the job you save may be your own.""""Gung Ho"" does a better job of capturing the mood of the American industrial workforce than just about any other popular movie made during that period. Certainly the movie has its flaws -- some loose plot threads and mediocre acting jobs by everyone except Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe. But the story really is about the meeting of East and West: Keaton's Hunt Stevenson personifies America, brash and confident on the outside yet insecure underneath. Watanabe's Kazuhiro personifies Japan, on top of the heap with a successful system, but wondering if there is more to be learned from their Western rivals. The movie's plot, flawed as it is, simply provides a framework for the conflict, and eventually synthesis, of their two personalities.Keaton's acting overshadows everyone else's, and practically makes the movie by itself. I've always admired Keaton for his ability to deliver  lines that feel improvised, no matter what script he's following. His character, Hunt Stevenson, is a likable, affable everyman, a natural leader with a wise-ass streak. But he has a fatal flaw common to many of us: he doesn't want to disappoint anyone. He'll distract the crowd with inspirational anecdotes, and even lie, rather than point out the ugly truth.Kazuhiro is the mirror image of Stevenson: shy and introspective, but also, because of his Japanese upbringing, reluctant to be the bearer of bad news. The scene in which Stevenson first comes to Kazuhiro with the employees' grievances captures perfectly the Japanese approach to workplace conflict. Kazuhiro replies to Stevenson's complaints with ""I understand what you are saying,"" but won't refuse his requests out loud. Stevenson misinterprets this as agreement, and goes away saying, ""Okay, we've got that settled."" (This is still a problem in Japanese-American business relations in the 21st century!)Ultimately, Kazuhiro and Stevenson have the same problem: get the factory working smoothly, meet production goals, and fulfill their responsibility to the workers under them. In working towards this goal, they each have to take a page from the others' book. Kazuhiro's family becoming more ""Americanized"" is an obvious example. Also note that Stevenson thinks it's odd when Kazuhiro explains how he had to make a public apology to his workers for failing them -- and yet, later in the movie, Stevenson does exactly that himself.The plot and its resolution are a little cornball, but hey, this is a comedy. If you can overlook the movie's flaws, there is a great story about self-realization and open-mindedness here.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ1MjdhZDItMjQzNS00ZjgzLTgzNjYtOGE4NTNkOGI0YWIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I was 19 years old then, and it was the first time for me to read ""Norwegian Wood."" The novel captured my interest, and I have read it again and again since then, and I still read it even now. ""Norwegian Wood"" is one of my favorite books.The novel ""Norwegian Wood"" depicts the university days of the main character, Watanabe Tohru. In the novel, he lives in Tokyo, and goes to university. He likes reading American modern literature. He did not have any friends except for one best friend during his high school days, but the friend killed himself at the age of seventeen. Watanabe has several relationships with women between the age of 18 and 21. Some characters in the novel, other than Watanabe's best friend, have also killed themselves. The novel consists of sex, death, literature, and intelligence.I went to university, and had some close female friends. In addition, I liked reading classic literature. Furthermore, I did not belong to a sport clubs at university, so the scope of my friendship was limited. In essence, I felt a sense of intimacy with Watanabe while reading the novel. (In fact, I learnt ""The Catcher in the Rye"" by J. D. Salinger and ""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald from Norwegian Wood, and both books were the first English novels which I completed reading in their original language.) Norwegian Wood is an important book for me, so I was glad to hear, 2 to 3 years ago, that the movie version of this novel would be screened. The movie was released about one week ago, and I went to see it today.Locations shot in the movie were beautiful, and the music sounds good. In particular, I was moved by one scene in which Reiko sang ""Norwegian Wood"" by the Beatles with a guitar, and Naoko lost her mental stability during Reiko's performance. In addition, the cast members in the movie were also good, especially Mizuhara Kiko, who played Midori, was very cute and vivid.Since I have read the novel over and over, and remember the whole story in detail, I can go so far as to say that I do not need any explanation for the story in the movie. Because I know the story, I was purely interested in how the film director, Tran Anh Hung, had expressed the novel through the media of a movie.The movie version of ""Norwegian Wood"" was not solely a converted version of the novel, but represented its originality and creativity with the help of movie techniques, such as music, voice (cry, laugh, or angry), facial expression, and scenery.However, it is certain that those who have never read the novel will not enjoy the movie.(The above comment is forwarded from my blog at http://metropolitantokyo.blogspot.com/)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3NTM0Nzg3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE3MDMxNw@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Chu (Sihung Lung), a celebrated chef who runs the kitchen of a huge restaurant, finds himself at an impasse however; his daughters, Jia-Jen (Kuei-Mei Yang), the eldest, a teacher, Jia-Chen (Chien-lien Wu), his second, an airline executive, and Jia-Ning (Yu-Wen Wang), the youngest, who works at a fast food restaurant, all still live with their father, and though they are adults (all in their twenties), he feels responsible for them, as they are still under his roof.  They, on the other hand, feel responsible for him; he'll soon be retired, and they fear age is catching up with him.  And it makes them each, in turn, think twice about career opportunities and any romantic entanglements that may appear on the horizon. it's a situation they all realize is not conducive to a happy, fulfilling and fully functional family life; the love is there, but it's seasoned with frustration, and no one seems to know what to do about it.	Lee has crafted and delivered a complex, involving film, laced with poignancy and humor that deals with the kinds of problems most people face during the course of their lives.  And, of course, there's the love, the many faces of which are all explored here.  Food is the metaphor; Chu sets his table with a variety of tantalizing and exotic offerings, even as the table of life is set with like fare, and once set, it is up to the individual to sample what they will.  Fittingly, it is at the dinner table that many of the meaningful events in the lives of the family members are revealed.  Working from a screenplay written by Lee, James Schamus and Hui-Ling Wang, Lee uses the intricate emotional weave of the story to optimum effect with his ability to illuminate the sensibilities of his characters, and that he does it so well demonstrates the depth of his own insight into human nature.  And that he can so proficiently transfer the emotions of the written page to the screen demonstrates his mastery of the art of film directing.  As he proves with this film (as with films like `The Ice Storm' and `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'), he is simply one of the best directors in the business.	Lee's unique touch is also felt in the performances he exacts from his actors, a number of which are outstanding in this film, beginning with Lung, who brings Chu so credibly to life.  Wang, Wu and Yang are also exemplary in their portrayals of Chu's daughters.  To their credit-- as well as Lee's-- there's not a false moment to be found in their performances, all of which stand up to even the closest scrutiny.  These are all very real people in a very real setting, which enables the audience to identify and relate to the characters and their story, assuring that connection which makes this film such a satisfying experience.		The supporting cast includes Sylvia Chang (Jin-Rong), Winston Chao (Li Kai), Chao-jung Chen (Guo Lun), Lester Chit-Man Chan (Raymond), Yu Chen (Rachel), Jui Wang (Old Wen) and Ah Lei Gua (Madame Ling).  As with real life, `Eat, Drink, Man, Woman' is far from predictable, and is filled with twists and turns, including a surprise at the end that equals anything M. Night Shyamalan could come up with.  In the final analysis, this film is a delightful, entertaining reflection upon the human condition that will awaken your taste buds and prepare you for the feast of life.  And, like life, it is there for the taking; grab it with both hands and embrace it. By the end, you'll be glad you did.  I rate this one 10/10.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGEyNDI0OGQtMjY3Yi00NGU5LWFiNTQtNWMyZmJmNDAzMDMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

His unsettling mixture of compassion, anger at the world's injustice, and a complementary willingness to laugh at cruelty made him a unique performer. But ten years' good work has been undone in an instant Ã¢ÂÂ though it felt like a small eternity Ã¢ÂÂ with this film. A stultifying 94-minutes of non-plot, non-acting, non-scripted tedium which was filmed on video over five days in a caravan park. Hoyle plays the eponymous character who has sex with his hunky young nephew Ashley (Ashley Ryder) and sometimes pimps him out to other men.The film comprises mostly of Uncle David giving boring lectures on consumerism and heteronormativism to Ashley. There is a small break in the tedium when they dance around their caravan for a bit, and a nice 45-second interlude when the two characters charm some cows in a foggy field. But then we're back to Uncle David drivelling on for the third time about how people who go to work are drones and mortgages are bad. The film ends with its ""shocking"" climax, but it's shocking only in that it's dragged out for so long. Seeing Hoyle live, he has a tremendous energy which somehow seems to evaporate when captured on cheap video. Even when he's smashing up some china figurines (daringly representing the Christian family) there's something quite soporific about his performance. It's a good bit of marketing having Ryder as co-star though the man can barely act. Even a relatively simple line like ""that blue's nice, it matches your top"" Ã¢ÂÂ which is hardly ""once more into the breach"" Ã¢ÂÂ seems beyond him. Hoyle should have remembered the 27th Law of Showbiz: Porn stars and actors should never be confused. This is the law which explains why Ian McKellen was never asked to do World Soccer Orgy 3.Although I thought it the most tedious film I've seen in years I'm sure others will warm to its critique of Western Society, its ""transgressive"" nature, and its shots of Ashley Ryder naked.Oh, and one other thing. If, for some reason I can't fathom, you want to push up the film's IMDb star rating probably best not to give it ten stars as it looks a tad suspicious. Although I loathed the film I could imagine someone giving it a six or a seven. Possibly an eight. Maybe, God help us, a nine. But today's stats show that 7 out of 18 voters have given it the maximum rating believing that Uncle David is up there with The Passion of Joan of Arc, Bicycle Thieves, Vertigo, Citizen Kane, 2001: A Space Odyssey,Rosemary's Baby,ÃÂ.I could go on but I'd imagine you get the point.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjcxZDUyMWItZjk5NC00ZGEzLTg0YjEtZWZhODE4NDZkYTFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0NTI0Nw@@._V1_UY209_CR4,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Forget about this being a RHPS sequel. It's not. The whole tone is different. RHPS was an affectionate salute to B-science fiction movies of the 50's married to the seventies punk rock movement. ""Shock Treatment"", if it is related to RHPS at all, is a satire of the whole RHPS fan culture. Consider: ""Shock Treatment"" takes place in a TV studio where the audience lives 24/7. They live for the highs received from Denton TV, yet are a pretty conservative lot on the whole. Isn't that like the typical RHPS audience where straight laced Brad and Janet types go to the show, enjoy the freakiness for two hours, then go back to their normal, suburban lives? ""Shock Treatment"" goes to great lengths to satirize the horrors of suburbanity, and the costumed entertainers they worship. The most blatant example? Two of the main characters, who profess to be doctors, turn out to be character actors. Character actors who have great fun in costume and in the end, drive off into the sunset, in a cool new car, back to suburban normalcy. And you know what? I have barely scratched the surface of what makes ""Shock Treatment"" so clever. If you've read anything recent written about it, you know the film is a huge piss take on reality television, and a prescient(by over 20 years)parody of our current culture which makes stars of...well, whomever the TV industry, film industry, and Hollywood publicists tell us we should think of as stars. Paris Hilton? Vin Diesel? Even Jude Law. Did we discover these people? No, they were foisted upon us,we were TOLD they were stars, much as Janet is in ""Shock Treatment"". When Janet wakes up and realizes she wants her real life back, another cute chick is pimped up and easily accepted.""Shock Treatment"" is a very smart movie that works on the intellectual level RHPS did not. Hey, I love RHPS, but it operates from a gut, instinctual level. ""Shock Treatment"", if you give it a chance, will make you think about the media's grip on society, make you take a second look at the ""stars"" adorning the covers of magazines such as Entertainemt Weekly, give you a whole new take on the audiences lining up for RHPS every Halloween (unlike the 80's when we went every month or weekend), and, having been made in 1981 (!) add no surprise to the fact that Richard O'Brien is a prescient futurist who made a killing in the stock market.Heck, I haven't even talked about the fact that ""Shock Treatment""s use of primary colors, editing, and music video style sequences, predates the birth of MTV by at least a year. This movie could be called a template for the 80's music video boom.Lastly, I have to comment on one facet which will either a) draw RHPS fans and non fans to check this move out or b) disregard this entire review. I absolutely, unequivocally, LOVE the music in this movie. Every song is fun in the best tradition of the short lived ""rock musical"" genre (I often sing a somewhat edited version of ""Lullaby"" to my kids at bedtime)and, on screen, every song is presented with a strong sense of atmosphere. Come to think of it, this IS ""Shock Treatment""s greatest commonality to RHPS, except in RHPS, the atmosphere was dark and cluttered, in ""Shock Treatment"", it's bright and sterile. Two different settings. Two different themes. Both brilliantly achieved.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWM1NThjMmUtMjM5Zi00NzBhLTljZjgtYjYxOTJkYzA1NmQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

However veterans like Om Puri and Anupam Kher looked disposed. All the characters grow gradually in the film and make you think their way. Everyone is given enough space to justify their talent. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra is a director of the new emerging Indian cinema, he always tries to bring in something very different. I was really impressed by his last attempt in 2001 for Aks (Amitabh Bachchan and Manoj Bajpai ), and he definitely has succeeded in making another fabulous master piece. The highlight of the movie is the great use of cinematography techniques. Its probably for the first time in Indian cinema that juxtaposing has been used with such a great effect. The way each character gradually immerses into scenes from the past leaves you fantasizing about the hard work that has gone in the background to create this, both technically and on the part of the actor.The movie starts on a very high spirit reflecting today's youth mindset who believe that patriotism is something that looks good in history chapters and today's world is far ahead of all that, they would prefer to go boozing and dancing rather than thinking on any of those lines. The way the campus scenes are shown really makes everyone go down the memory lanes of beautiful college days. This is followed by some intriguing drama and events which turns the life of a group of buddies upside-down altogether.The film grows on you gradually. The director has made sure that there is a clear message in everything he presents, even the group of boys represents different sects of society and religion. Hence creating an appeal for everyone watching it. Music is another high point of the show, its foot tapping and very much with the mood of the subject. The songs give you a sense of freedom from within, a freedom to think in one's own way. A.R. Rehman doesn't need any introductions and he is surely one of the most original music directors we have in the country.The brilliance of Aamir Khan is something very difficult to narrate, he has proved it umpteen number of times that he is truly the most versatile actor in the industry. His comic timing in the first part is better than anything seen in recent past. He is extremely fluent even with difficult Punjabi tongue twisters and the acting prowess he has shown would be very difficult to match by anyone around. He appears so natural and his complete look with new hairstyle (which is now part of his every new movie) gives a very striking combination.Well the most wanting part of the whole thing has been the script to certain extent, it appears very loose in the second half and at times gives a droning feel. Few new ideas presented by the author looked half-baked. However it has been the technical expertise of the director who managed to save the things with some outstanding camera work and editing.Rang De ÃÂ is for sure a must watch movie, it doesn't have any preaching but still it will force you to think once. As they say it ""There are two primary choices in life, to accept conditions as they exist or take upon the responsibility to change them"". I believe most of us want to bring about the changes without doing anything, so its time to think again folks and take some responsibility, lets Paint It Yellow","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThmZDA0YmQtMWJhNy00MDQwLTk0Y2YtMDhmZTE5ZjhlNjliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@._V1_UY209_CR3,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The unlikely courtship of Mr Darcy and (in our movie) a beautiful Indian girl starts with mutual contempt, but moves forward as they become wiser and learn that their first instincts, based on pride, prejudice and illusions, were wrong.The scene moves between Amritsar and Goa to London and Beverley Hills, all in brighter-than-bright super-saturated colour, with an assortment of equally colourful characters, wonderful costumes, lavish dance pieces and heavenly bollywood-style ballads. While almost everything is in English (except for a few subtitled songs), nearly all the characters are top Indian performers.In the golden age of musicals, stars such as Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire had a whole sub-industry to draw on for good dancers who could also sing and act well, plus the technicians used to producing high-end musicals. As demand waned, so did supply, and the West is now hard pressed to produce song and dance films that don't rely on snappy editing to suggest good dancing from top actors, or heavy coaching to suggest top dancers can act. Bollywood, on the other hand, has no such shortage, and Bride and Prejudice is the sumptuously choreographed musical with Indian dancing that has become nigh impossible with western dancers.Admittedly it's a bit cheesy at times - but it's self-consciously so, and as endearing as warm, gushy Indian hospitality. The sets and dialogue give authentic, if stereotypical, glimpses of Indian life and values. Like many east-meets-west movies, the stereotypes are a handle to allow easy assimilation of foreign ideas, and the heavy Indian involvement wards off any tendency to patronise (which is one of the themes explored in the film).This is not high drama or high art, but it's an accomplished romantic comedy / song-and-dance film, and one that warms the heart and makes you want to wave your arms in the air Indian-dance-style for the sheer joy and exuberance of happy endings.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI2N2M3YzYtNTI3OS00ZTgxLTg1OWEtOTQ1NWY3N2NlMDYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Viewing it, as I did, at a morning showing on opening day, however, is not to be recommended. Having said that, I am not sure when the optimum time for seeing this film would actually be.There is a lot of very uncomfortable viewing here. The subject matter - such as it is - is very bleak, but, paradoxically, more life-affirming than depressing. That is to say, I looked at the majority of the characters on screen and thought: please don't let me end up like that.The plot is thin - that is not meant pejoratively, it's not a plot-driven film - but the performances of the cast simply roar off the screen. Peter Mullan and Eddie Marsan are fantastic, but then again, they always are (as an aside, does Marsan not tire of playing scumbags?), but the real revelation in this film is the performance of Olivia Colman.She is perfect in this, absolutely note-perfect; incredible acting. Awesome in her delivery. So good, in fact, that you forget this is just a movie. Her performance here is definitely going to propel her into the upper echelons of British acting - if she is not already there.Tyrannosaur is not faultless, there are some scenes that linger too long and others that linger not long enough, but for an early effort from Considine this promises much for the future. This is Considine's 'Taxi Driver' and I will queue around the block for Considine's 'Goodfellas'.Superb writing and gritty direction; performances better yet and Colman delivers on every level. Bravo Ms Colman, and bravo to everyone else associated with the best British film of the decade.See it.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNzAxMDgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODM5NzU4NQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

In itself, it was a highly successful experiment: the variety of creative camera techniques and the fast-paced progression of images create an effective portrait of the city of Moscow as a typical day goes by.  Now, several decades later, it remains distinctive in its style and content, and is even more interesting in that it also allows us a glimpse of daily life in an unfamiliar place and time.Starting with a look around the city in the morning before things start to happen, it then moves through the day, often coming back to the same site or individual at different times.  The incidents shown range from routine daily activities to recreation to emergencies, with everything in between.  The sense of realism is such that, despite the rather short clips of specific individuals, you can sometimes feel almost a part of what the persons on-screen are experiencing.  At other times, it's just intriguing to have this kind of look at a different era.The thorough-going experimentation, especially with the unusual camera methods, could easily have led to an unwatchable mess if not done with care. Even experienced film-makers, especially at the present time, too often over-indulge in such techniques to the point where the substance of their films becomes secondary to mere artifice.  But here, Dziga Vertov achieved a skillful fit between technique and material, creating a film that has held up very well over the years.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTc3NGVlN2QtYWJlZi00YjhjLThiZjctZDA1MmE1NGI4ZmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODQyNDU4OTk@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

For them, sexuality has become a substitute for love, resulting from emotional neglect.","3","If you are a parent of a teenage girl this movie is not for youÃÂ or is it?","I remember when I saw ""kids"" (1995), somehow I thought it provided an educational purpose and it it made me plan for the future.Some of us do everything we believe is the right thing to do as a parent, some others don't, and some of us worry, trying not to think about every time we let our kid out the door. And ""Little Thirteen"" (2013) is a scary movie, not because of ghouls and decapitations, but for the portrayal of the behavior of the protagonists.""Little Thirteen"" at first, seems to have the only reason as to arouse the ""perverts"" or to remind us of our own sins and the sins that our own kids may or may have not yet committed. But let me play the guy standing on the middle of the street with a big sign that says: ""No salvation"" unless... we lock up the M iley Cyru s, and Snookies of the world, and throw the key away.Certainly there is not too much that is new in this movie, it's more of a nasty reminder, seasoned with some porn, and a couple of traumatizing scenes such as a kid slapping a baby to wake him up, or when the same kid is resting in the street like a common drunk, after eating too much candy, for some this is an implausible scenario, for others part of a crude world. It also crossed my mind that this movie was to promote promiscuity and somehow make us believe that such behavior at early age should be acceptable. But as the movie went on, the intentions for it became clearer.The movie opens with what it is supposed to be a very young girl in a t-shirt and underwear, still, the director, manages to send our attention to a hamster's cage, so I hoped that it would be more of an art movie than exploitation. Instead it pounds on what most of us supposed to know by now, that as ""glamorous"" as it may be on young minds, sex and alcohol without a real education is just the beginning of the end with irreversible consequences. That is where the movie does its best, telling, once more, how dumb is just pleasing our senses and desires, ignoring what is in front of the eyes.""Yvonne"", one of the characters already has two children and not much to look forward to, and ""Charly"", her sister, is merely a continuation of that vicious circle. If it sounds familiar it's because it could be your own story or the story of your neighbors, or the person you just crossed on the street. You don't need to be a genius to anticipate that the unhappy forever comes after the ""I want to have fun now"" and that is what the scene of Yvonne looking through the Pirate Telescope represents while she weeps ""seeing"" everything she has lost and all she will never have.My only complaint is that the movie could have done without the last bedroom scene; still, I understand that the writers and director used it to make a point for Sarah's closing thoughts. Overall if you are looking for a good time this is not a movie for you, but if you are in the mood for planning someone's future or your own, then welcome to the life of this girls.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU4NDA0MzE5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgzMTQ5NzE@._V1_UY209_CR8,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

There, he discovers a centuries-old forgotten passageway into the fantastic world of Mozart's ""The Magic Flute.""","16","Good looks, bad singing","Since there is no review of this movie so far, I will try to do the first one. Unfortunately, it won't be a very nice review.Let's start with the good parts: The look of the movie is quite okay. There are nice shots from Austria, and some parts I even know. Also the fantasy-sequences (i.e. The part where the plot of the opera is set) are nice to look at. Sure, it's not ""Lord of the Rings"", but the effects are okay and the sets are, well, not really lavish, but convincing. Also the connection between the parts in the reality and the fantasy-parts was well done, without giving away too much. Yes, there is a bit of clichÃÂ© regarding the pupils in the 'Mozart-school', but that's okay; it's not more than usual in a High school movie, and to a certain degree this is a High school movie.The parts I can live with: Not surprisingly, there is a lot of political correctness: Monostatos, who in the opera is a slave from Africa, is now some old white guy (very white indeed!); instead, Sarastro, 'the good guy', is now a person of colour. Okay, why not! Having a boarding school in an old castle is a big clichÃÂ©: All important music schools in Austria are, of course, at places where you have ample opportunities to stay on stage, i.e. In the big cities, i.e. In Vienna and in Salzburg. But okay; the castle is a nice location.The bad parts: Well, there is one thing which wasn't as bad as I thought: After having seen the trailer, I was afraid that they would try to 'update' Mozart's music somehow. Fortunately, they didn't: When we hear Mozart in this movie, it is the original, classical music. (Or more or less; I am no expert on that. The music we get is basically a 'Best Of' of the opera.) There is also some additional, modern score by Martin Stock, but separated from Mozart's music. So far, so good - as long as there is no singing! Because this is by far the biggest problem of this movie: The voices of the actors might be okay for a musical, but not for Mozart. Clearly, they are no trained singers, and this is a big issue for a movie which is mostly about classical music! The only exception seems to be Sabine Devieilhe, who is doing the Queen of the night; it is just impossible to do her part in an un-ridiculous way without some training. Otherwise, the singing is more or less embarrassing. Why haven't they chosen some young singers? There should be enough of them, who are also good looking, and probably even some, who also can act on the screen. Pity ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjg3MDY1N2ItMzZjZC00MTc0LThiYjYtYmFkNWNmODEyZDU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAxNzQ1NzI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

And the lazy writing. And the cheap 3D gimmick.","Remember Saw? Remember what happened to that franchise? After becoming a Halloween staple, it was immediately overshadowed by the newer, fresher Paranormal Activity series, with the last Saw using 3D as a final resort to churn out one more film from the dying franchise. Now, we're seeing the same thing from Paranormal Activity. In fact, the desperation to milk one last film is apparent, and it's sad. Alas, this is the cycle every horror franchise goes through. I have to admit, I personally enjoyed this series longer than I would expect. To call PA4 disappointing is an understatement, but The Marked Ones made up for it and surprised the hell out of me.However, TGD is easily the worst film in the series, one of the worst films of the year, and a sad, cynical, soulless attempt to salvage whatever is left from this franchise. There's literally nothing memorable here, nothing iconic. It's all so generic and inept, from the constant jump scares, to the forgettable actors, to the 3D, which is used in the most clichÃÂ©d way possible. The story doesn't make a lick of sense compared to all the buildup in the previous films, most likely due to the noticeable absence of Christopher Landon, who wrote all the sequels up until this point. And why the hell did it take two years for four writers to write the script? Was that really necessary? Overall, there's not much to be said about TGD because there's not much to actually talk about. By the time of writing this review, I've already forgotten about 90% of the movie, and you will too. So don't watch it. You don't need to see the activity. Whatever you come up with in your imagination is probably far scarier than this movie would ever dream to achieve.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMjE5OTA3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDAxNTg4NjE@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Nicolas Pesce on writing/directing debut shows true class and masterful control of his story. Every scene is beautifully laid out and haunting in its own way. This is the work of a master, not a novice.One of the things I liked most about this movie was that it never insults its viewer. A lot of the story was left up to interpretation. We are given small hints towards things in the dialogue here and there, but must make our own decisions on what the truth actually is.The first two-thirds of the film were so strong that I was almost expecting to be let down by the final third. It seems today that films struggle to be consistently good throughout and usually end up mucking up at least one portion of their story. Instead 'The Eyes of My Mother' makes the final third its strongest of the lot. Modern horror tends to rely incredibly heavily on jump scares. In fact it's all a lot of them have going for them. There is not a single jump scare in this film and yet it is infinitely more scary and memorable than 99% of horror films released today. This is a movie that will stick with me for a while and one that I will probably watch again. Do not miss this film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyMDkyMDA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE5MDExMDI@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Pret-a-Porter is a pretty good Robert Altman film that is no better or worse than Short Cuts, which, while I feel it is a good film, I also think it is overrated. This one is, however, heavily underrated, and they both got the same imdb score from me: 7/10 = 3/4 stars.This is another attempt to make another Nashville. There's a humongous ensemble cast of actors, some of the best on the planet, a couple of the best who ever lived. The screenwriter doesn't connect it all very well, and lots of the characters seem superfluous or underdeveloped, unlike in Nashville where even the characters who are only in a couple of scenes are as familiar to the viewer as a close friend. I would particularly have liked the Danny Aiello/Teri Garr section to have been removed. It falls pretty flat. The Sophia Loren/Marcello Mastrioanni section, the section that most film buffs are going to be excited for, also plops by its end. And Kim Basinger, a good actress, truly deserving her L.A. Confidential Oscar, is not very good as the Southern U.S. reporter: her accent is difficult to get around, and her character is often annoying, too. Sometimes, though, her pieces succeed.Many other of the vignettes succeed quite well, although there are never any fireworks about to shoot off. The Tim Robbins/Julia Roberts plot is very funny. The three publishers, Sally Kellerman, Tracy Ullman, and Linda Hunt's attempts to sign photographer Milo (Stephen Rea) to their magazine are all very humorous. The love quadrangle between the two designers, Forest Whitaker and Richard E. Grant, and their lovers is very good, also. Anouk Aimee's section is also great, maybe the best part (Rupet Everett is good, also). I loved her so much in La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2.

This is not for film-goers who seek amusement, light entertainment, confirmation that the world is a just place. This could have been an unrelentingly grim film, because we see a great deal of the dark side of human nature. Instead, the characters have a wonderful complexity that allows us to empathize and hope. The themes are also rendered with complexityÃ¢ÂÂwe get to understand what initially seems incomprehensible. The acting is very fine, indeed. The landscapes are haunting. There is a lot of tension in the movie that provides forward momentum.

Cathartic for her maybe, but pretty boring for us.","Cult actress Asia Argento, daughter of Italian horror legend Dario Argento and his former leading lady Daria Nicolodi, almost uses 'Scarlet Diva' as therapy. She is the first to admit that she has a lot of demons to battle, and this semi-autobiographical digital video movie about a successful Italian actress (and ""the loneliest girl in the world"") trying to find happiness, or at least some relief, through sex, drugs and some disastrous relationships, was obviously cathartic for her to make. Unfortunately it is a very uneven and at times unbelievable film and is almost impossible to get involved with. Anna/Asia's pain and despair isn't hidden but the script is so shallow and the acting so unconvincing that it becomes little more than a freak show. Personally I found Argento's commentary on the DVD much more interesting than the movie itself. In it she spells out just how much of the movie is based on real situations in her life, and explains what has been changed or slightly fictionalized. Hearing her talk honestly about how much this movie means to her, and how for example, getting her own mother (Nicolodi) to play her fictional mother altered their relationship for the better, was more effective than watching the actual movie. It also makes you feel bad for slamming this, but what can you do? It just isn't very good. Argento also talks about how she felt betrayed by her friend Vincent Gallo ('Buffalo 66'), who agreed to play the rock star Kirk Vaines character, but then blew it by asking for too much money. If you look closely you will see Asia stand on a picture of his face in one scene.  She also discusses how working with Abel Ferrara on the troubled 'New Rose Hotel' inspired her to direct, and how Ferrara and her father Dario Argento (who gets a production credit) were the only two people to encourage her with this project. I just hope that if she directs again the results are a lot more interesting than this amateurish effort. I say avoid this movie unless you are a complete Asia Argento nut. Otherwise if you must watch it, make sure you listen to the commentary and watch the interview segment, as you will get a lot more out of them than 'Scarlet Diva' itself.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjg1M2ZjNmItM2YwMy00Y2RmLThmNDAtNTJjZmVjMTcxMjVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTkyMjQwNw@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

To be fair, Sienna Miller does a wonderful job with the material she's been given. Sadly, it's not a lot to work with.One of the major flaws in Factory Girl is that there is no character that you can like. I wasn't sure who I was supposed to care about, possibly because no character was ever developed enough to get past their surface. It's hard to portray Andy Warhol in film, after all of the versions that have been done, and his own status as more icon than man. This film only proved the point, by playing him in a way that felt more like a parody than a person.Over and over again, the film takes the easy road, from its After School Special depiction of drug use to the predictable dialogue, walks through Central Park, even the establishing shot of the Eiffel Tower to show ""hey, look, they're in Paris!""New York looks like a studio set, and the filmmakers give the impression that they aren't even familiar with the city. A cab is told to go to ""2nd Avenue and Fifth,"" where somehow a massive concert is taking place - despite the fact that the address is in the East Village, with only mom & pop stores and small bars in the area. The casting is nothing if not bizarre. Hayden Christensen as Bob Dylan, sorry, ""Billy Quinn,"" comes off as an opinionated (though incredibly fit and Gentile) jerk with a guitar, Guy Pearce is too attractive for Andy, while Sienna Miller doesn't have Edie's soft beauty.The greatest crime is that this will be many people's first introduction to Edie Sedgwick, and they will go away with an impression of a simple, disposable girl - with none of her glamour, whose problems can be neatly wrapped up in a few lines about her father. Her entry into Andy's world is nothing more than an entrance to a party, and her fall is just a soap opera decline.If you have any interest in Edie Sedgwick at all, do yourself a favor and watch Ciao Manhattan, but by all means, avoid Factory Girl.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTQ5ZTM1OGEtOTg4NS00MTU1LTk5NGItZDBkYTRhODcwN2JhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzI1NzMxNzM@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The story centers primarily on Molly and Johnny, two teenagers who are deeply, madly, and wildly in love, but their parents just won't have it. It seems their parents are willing to do just about everything to keep them apart. Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue are both magnificent as the star-crossed lovers. All right, so Troy seems a little stilted at times, but Sandra is perfection as the beautiful young girl who constantly finds herself at odds with her eagerness to do the right thing, and  fulfilling her love for Donahue. Dee hits all the right marks as the emotionally troubled girl, delivering what is possibly her all-time best performance. It was certainly a breakthrough for the gifted young star who proved that she could do more than play smiling, giggling, relentlessly perky teens. It's a magnificent achievement, and anyone who has ever doubted Sandra's acting abilities are in for a big surprise when they see her in this film. Other acting honors go to Richard Egan and Constance Ford as Dee's unhappy parents, and the always marvellous Dorothy McGuire as Egan's old flame. That's not to say that the actors don't stumble at times with some supremely silly dialogue, but their star power and great talent rides rather smoothly over the film's bumpy spots, making this film an enjoyable classic of the teenage-angst genre. It's also one of the most stylishly done films in the genre. The great director Delmer Daves gives the film his full attention, and it's a sleek, colorful production that ranks right up there with other films with similarly-related themes like REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE and SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS for example. It all may seem rather dated, but truthfully, this film is just as enjoyable now as it was when it was first released in 1959, and that title theme is still hauntingly beautiful and memorable.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFjZTU3NGYtYWU3OS00YzE1LTlkYzQtODg4NjMzOWM1YTMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk2MzI2Ng@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's a very dark movie and it gets a bit bloody sometime so if you're not into that be warned. My vote is 8/10 i recommend it to everyone and hope to see more of Mr. Fiennes work behind the camera.

It isn't one of his best pictures since he really was just the director and the script and the actors did more work than he needed to do on the picture.  Like The Color of Money, it's a film that if he didn't direct it it wouldn't of made much of a difference in the outcome.Still, give credit where credit is due, and those (very few I might think) that heard what Cassavettes said to Scoresese after the movie got released (he told Marty that it was a piece of s*** and to work on something better- which he did with Mean Streets) should disregard it.  Overall, Boxcar Bertha is a watchable and good piece of cinema with some decent performances and an overall feel that works in it's ""tradition of Bonnie & Clyde"" genre.

I was aware of Webb's writing and vilification at the time they occurred, in the late '90s, but for over 50 years I had a front row seat for even pre-Nixonian ""drug wars"" through the ""crack epidemic,"" genocidal American imperialism, and the treatment of many other reporters who dared challenge the status quo, who had the courage to painfully examine the quaint and naive notion of collective national decency.Webb's story, so artfully recounted and performed, was unfortunately true. He was accused of distorting the actuality of Reagan-era hypocrisy, but his reporting was accurate. He never accused the CIA of intentionally destroying the social fabric of minority communities, but made it clear that Harlem and Watts and Chicago's South Side were victims of ""collateral damage,"" the inevitable consequences of the abandonment of any pretense of morality ostensibly possessed by the Reagan administration.Indeed, spurred by new information about the practice of questionable property seizures, Webb had once again picked at the scab covering the decade-old, gangrenous infestation of our government, later well described by Robert Parry in his October 2004 Salon piece, ""How Kerry exposed the Contra-cocaine scandal."" To get the story, Webb had exposed himself to blood curdling danger, both at his own home in the U.S. and on the scene, in Central America.Perhaps the worst betrayal of public trust by this film is depicted in recapitulation of the collective response of the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, after being pressured by the CIA and the State Department. The papers' responded with hyperactive involvement in the personal destruction of Webb's reporting, reputation and life. Previously. the same papers, pressured by Reagan administration officials, buried Senator John Kerry's investigation, and shared subsequent malfeasance in their facilitating the Bush/Cheney administration's illegal and genocidal invasion and occupation of Iraq.The NY Times and Post had some odious history themselves. Reporters Ray Bonner and Alma Guillermoprieto were reassigned to boring beats after their courageous exposure of the incredibly savage El Mozote Massacre in El Salvador.There, the U.S. trained, funded and armed Atlacatl Battalion murdered almost a thousand peasants, largely neutral evangelical Protestants, and mostly women and children, on December 11, 1981. Stanley Miesler's El Mozote Case Study, published in the Columbia Journalism Review, exhaustively documented their fates.This film captured all those similar disgraceful elements. It needs to be seen by a wider audience just as it would be wise to make ""Dr. Strangelove"" part of a core curriculum in the formal education of American adolescents.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM5MDIxNzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUzMTk4MTE@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

At no point did I feel I was looking at real characters. I just felt I was seeing Bernie Mac playing the role of the father, and Ashton playing the 'boyfriend'. Ashton was silly while trying to be funny, which is his style and personality. But he was unconvincing and awkward while trying to be serious. Ashton is just in over his head with this kind of acting. He was in his element with the show 'Punked', and 'Dude Where's my Car?'.In short, this is one I would suggest waiting to see on video. If you were thinking of a good evening out, I would suggest Hitch or go with a totally different genre of movie.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjIyYzBlYmUtYzg1Yy00MDhjLTlmYjUtMTZlMWI0NmFmZTFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwNDU1MzEy._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I have to admit the first act has some really funny moment, and the actor who portrays Leslie Vernon is great. That being said, the second part turns into a full-blown slasher. The break is WAY too rough to really make it believable, plus the slasher part does not deliver the suspense nor the action, nor the gore we would expect from that kind of movie, which makes it quite monotonous and basically, dull. The director did an okay job, alternating between hand-held video cameras for the documentary parts and stable HD cams for the slasher parts. The guys does have a respect for the genre, but that won't necessarily make the movie good. The cast is pretty solid, especially the guy who plays Leslie Vernon like I said earlier. So the ''mockumentary'' part is pretty funny, but the ending is terrible.

By 1981, the Blaxploitation action film was exhausted. - Although Fred Williamson had made a couple of action films in the mid-'80s, these don't really count, because Williamson can't act and can't direct. The good news was that African-American cinema could say farewell to a stereotype; the bad news was that Hollywood wanted to find some way to say farewell to African-American cinema. The mid-'80s were lean years for anyone with dark-skin in Hollywood. One of the problems had been that people critical of blaxploitation had missed the fact that Hollywood only does two type of films with any regularity, the action film (Western, Sci-Fi, crime, etc.) and the sit-com (domestic comedy). The notion that Hollywood does dramatic or otherwise serious films is a myth Hollywood likes to drag out at the Academy Awards. So if you're not making action films or comedies, you're not in Hollywood.By the late '80s it was clear to everyone that African Americans (now constituting a sizable portion of regular movie audiences) were going to have to be represented on film again. But by then it was also clear that this audience wasn't going to tolerate being relegated to pimp and gang roles, at least not completely. For one thing, Eddie Murphy had broken the blaxploitation mold in 48 Hours and Beverly Hills Cop. I don't think anybody realizes that Murphy's roles in these films are a basic blaxploitation stereotypes, because Murphy clearly wasn't going to let himself be stereotyped. Murphy's popularity and savvy probably caused more anxiety than the anger of Melvin Van Peebles or Richard Pryor ever had, because it was clear that he was there to make money, something Hollywood could really understand.At any rate: In 1988 the Wayans produced I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, a knock-down parody of the blaxploitation genre that pretty much assured that it would never raise its afro-covered head again. But it was still clear that African Americans needed a new action hero; so enter Action Jackson. The reason why this film is not better remembered as the return of the black action hero is clearly because of the script. This is paint-by-numbers formula movie-making; this script has been written and filmed a hundred times, and every action star in Hollywood has appeared in some version of it, all of the Baldwin brothers in turn, Sly Stallone, Kirk Russell, Seagal, Schwarzenegger, Brandon Lee - I'm sure the reader can fill in the titles of each actor's version, regardless how unmemorable the films may have been. This formula was a kind of rite-of-passage for anyone wanting to make action films in the late '80s - early '90s. So why not Carl Weathers?Actually, Weathers' performance in this film is quite good. It's hard to come up with a bone-breaking/rule-breaking cop who also happens to be suave and savvy (think part Dirty Harry, part James Bond), but Weathers nearly pulls it off. The decision not to play him with a 'black-english' accent and with no chip on his shoulder were exactly the qualities needed to leave the whole blaxploitation question away from the film at the time it was made. There are also some important ethnic transgressions here - we first find Vanity as the new mistress of the white bad-guy, whereas it's clear that Sharon stone's character has had a fling with Carl weathers'. Essentially, then, the film portrays a fantasy Detroit, where racism has indeed become a thing of the past that its all but forgotten. If only that were really true! But, again, that was exactly what was needed to get African Americans back into action films - i.e., back into Hollywood.The direction of the film is fairly tight. The characters are so two dimensional, it may not be noticeable but the performances are all pretty solid; the whole film is professionally produced and presented. Also, two years before everybody in America would discover who Jackie Chan was and that he came from somewhere called Hong Kong, there are some terrific stunts in this film. And I noticed that other critics have reported that both Sharon Stone and Vanity get naked in this movie; frankly, I find such comments tasteless. On the other hand, there's no denying the attraction some men will feel for such important examples of women taking proper care of their health.But the main point is, the film should be preserved if for now other reason, than because it was indeed the return to the mainstream of the strong African-American male hero; and we still need that in the cinema, and always have.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjc0Y2E2ZjYtZGQxNi00NDgxLTk0OTctMDAzYTg1MzFmMjI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc5NjEzNA@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

A good story let down by poor dialogue; some great acting as well as some mediocre and good direction marred by irritating and indiscriminate ""motion blur"" filming.The film has the elements and sometimes the feel of a charming love story, a modern-day fairy tale. The gentleness and innocence of the two main characters is in sharp contrast to the world inhabited by the secondary characters, where addiction to alcohol, gambling, desperation and suicide are the order of the day.Jude Law as Jeremy seems to have lost the plot. His half-hearted attempts at a Manchester accent are woeful. Why bother with the accent anyway? He is a coffee shop owner in NY, and his origins have no bearing whatsoever on the storyline. However, his natural charisma and his gentle demeanour do suit the role, and he pairs well with Norah Jones as Elizabeth.As for the flaws; is there ever total silence outside in the street in NY at night? And would customers really give their house keys to the person behind the counter in a coffee shop, to be kept in a glass jar? And would customers ever be known not by name, but by what they eat? And is there anyone in Manchester actually called Jeremy? As for Norah Jones, although she is on screen for most of the film, she does not have a lot to do or say ÃÂ which is just as well really. She spends most of her time watching in silent, doe-eyed admiration, as she is given a master class in acting by the ""real"" actors.The *real"" actors here are David Strathairn and Rachel Weisz. Strathairn gives a memorable, finely crafted performance as Arnie, who is a cop by day and an alcoholic barfly by night. Rachel Weisz as Sue Lynne his beautiful, wild, estranged wife makes full use of her short time on screen to create a wayward, tumultuous character at once sensuous, and sensitive. Between them they steal the show.But gripes aside, the director does manage to create an appealing, if flawed, film. It's a mixed bag.

A few films might focus on the dreaded Kapos in the camps -- or on the elitist Jewish Council members who helped organize the transport groups -- or on the musicians/performers who entertained the Nazis -- all of whom hoped that they would be allowed to survived.  But this film focuses on the Sonderkommandos -- the special workers -- who ushered Jewish victims to the gas chambers and burned the bodies.  They too hoped to survive.  But they must have known that they were going to be murdered eventually, if only because they had become the most dangerous witnesses to the cold Nazi horror.  And the film begins by informing us that these groups of Sonderkommandos were never allowed to live longer than four months. There are several reasons you must see this film.  First, it is based on the diary of Dr. Miklos Nyiszli, a Hungarian Jew chosen by Josef Mengele to be the head pathologist at Auschwitz.  And it dramaticizes the true attempt by Sonderkommandos to destroy the Auschwitz gas chambers. Second, it focuses on ethical dilemnas faced by Dr. Nyiszli and the various Sonderkommandos who are trying to save themselves, their families, or ... just someone ... anyone.  To say that these men were ""co-opted"" by the Nazis is to ignore the horror of the coercion, debasement and dehumanization that the Nazis inflicted -- not only on their prisoners, but upon themselves. One can imagine that some Sonderkommandos were selfish -- just as some Kapos were cruel and some doctors who assisted the Nazis were accomplices.  But the question remains -- what would you have done in the face of such coercion and duress?Third, the film -- based on Tim Blake Nelson's play -- is not the typical Holocaust film.  There is very little redeeming behavior.  There is no uplifting ending.  The grey zone of moral ambiguity is presented as a cold, unfeeling, horrifying place -- where you are damned if you do, and damned if you don't -- which means that they are all damned!  For the first third of the film, the script is obtuse, confusing, and disconnecting -- as it should be, considering that we may as well be taking the point of view of someone who just arrived on a train and entered the gates of hell.  How can any of this make sense?  In the opening scene, the Doctor is asked to save the life of a Jew who attempted suicide.  How absurd can that be -- to save the life of someone who will sooner rather than later be murdered by the Nazis anyway?!In conclusion, the play/film contains dialogue and scenes that are memorable.  This is one of my favorites.  One Jewish leader is demanding that they destroy the gas chambers as soon as possible.  But another Jewish leader is still planning on escape, arguing that he has every right to expect to live.  The first leader replies, something to the effect that, after what he has seen and done, he does not want to live! Today is Holocaust Memorial Day, April 18, 2004.  Last night, after seeing a Holocaust documentary on Kurt Gerron (""Prisoner of Paradise"") a friend of mine asked me what I would have done?  I told her that it would depend on whom I was caring for -- my wife and my daughters -- my parents.  It was then that I realized that I would have probably done everything that every Jew did during the Holocaust.  I would have tried to save myself and my family.  I would have abandoned others -- even betrayed others.  I would have killed.  I would have fought the Nazis.  And I would have probably been killed for it.  I would have despaired -- tried suicide -- become depressed, useless to everyone.  I don't think I would have survived.  I think the only question in that regard -- and it shows how irrelevant the question really is -- is ""how soon would I have died.""  That is why I remember Holocaust Memorial Day -- so that I will never forget -- and I can help work towards a time when such a hell will not occur in Europe, in Africa, in the Middle East, in the US, ... anywhere.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzNjQzMTQ0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjA0Mjc3._V1_UY209_CR2,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The title gives a clue to the meaning of Fellini's masterpiece: The Way. The brute, Zampano, buys the urchin-like Gelsomina to be his traveling companion in his one-man carnival act. He is physically and emotionally cruel to her. Her longing to love and be loved, and her child-like, yet acute perception of life, and desire to live it, despite hardships, makes her the perfect complement to the selfish and despicable Zampano. Their unification affects each other. However, although Zampano's harshness adversely effects Gelsomina's life, it is her influence that will eventually, and more significantly, change him. This may sound like the familiar Beauty and the Beast fairy tale, but it is more than a love story. It is about love, but it isn't until the very end of the film that we realize it. More than love, it is about a man who gains insight and awareness because of love. It is his finale transformation that demonstrates both the frailty and vitality of the human condition. It overpoweringly suggests that the individual, no matter how depraved, is able to spiritually evolve. Every frame and scene in this masterpiece has purpose and meaning.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2U1NGNjY2YtYmVlNy00ZjYzLThkODItNmE3NzVlMDA5OTNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTk4MjA5NjQ@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I do, and was completely taken in by the film.  My wife, on the other hand, doesn't have that experience and understands neither the film nor my fondness for it.  But I think that, if one is not distracted or confused or simply put off by the loud, emotional, sometimes corny religiosity portrayed here, one can see a strong, compelling story of a seriously, ultimately fatally flawed man whose faith in God and in God's mission for him reaches to his very core.On the surface, one can view Sonny Dewey as just another example of a certain type of religious fraud:  the backslapping, perpetually-grinning, wisecracking good old boy who uses religion and exploits his flock for his own selfish ends.  He looks like someone who doesn't practice what he preaches.  He womanizes, he's not above taking a snort from this pocket flask, he has a troubled marriage and we get the hint that he is the source of more than his share of the trouble, even to the extent of driving his wife into the arms of another man.  He seems to be just another Elmer Gantry or,  to pick from the real world, he's just like one of the fallen televangelists of recent years.  But just when you're comfortable with that judgment of him, Sonny proves you wrong.  He admits to his faults, some more freely than others.  But he makes no excuses for them and, in the end, he knows that he is going to pay for them.What really draws me into the film, and what really makes  Sonny interesting for me, is the way Duvall has made him such a complex character.   He's a bad guy and a good guy.  He is darkness and he is light.  He is sometimes endearing and other times someone you really don't feel comfortable trusting.   But by creating this ambiguity, Duvall does a service not only to the way religious leaders are characterized in film, he also pays homage to core religious issues.  By diving into the murky waters of Sonny's soul, Duvall goes into territory known to any seriously religious person.    As much as you might want things to be black and white, a good portion of the time you're being pulled back into the shadows:  there are good intentions and evil deeds; there are selfless aspirations and appetites to be fed. Sometimes you swing wildly from one side to the other.  Sometimes you are on an even keel.  Sometimes you're not sure.Faith and work determine how such a struggle will turn out.  Sonny is energized by both.  He believes in what he is doing.  He believes that God has given him a mission and he is determined to accomplish it, even in spite of himself.  While it might be tempting to make a stark contrast between the message Sonny preaches and the actions he has done that are contrary to it, one must always remember that a good preacher always preaches to himself as well as his congregation.  But some of the more revealing moments of the film are not when Sonny is in front of a congregation, or even with other people generally, but when he is alone with God:  ranting at God in anger; dedicating himself to God in the moment that he becomes the Apostle; the soul-searching moments when he forgives his wife and resigns himself to his fate.The no-punches-pulled realness of Sonny's struggle is a refreshing departure from the usual film portrayals of religious figures:  plaster saint, con-man, one-dimensional milquetoast.  But it also brings to the forefront the question of whether Sonny, or any of us, can be used for divine purpose.""The Apostle"" is beautifully filmed and captures well a portion of the rural South:  you can almost feel the humidity and smell the swampwater.  And while the well-known actors in the film (Farrah Fawcett, Billy Bob Thornton, Miranda Richardson) all turn in fine performances, it is the unknowns --the church members and townfolk -- that really give the film an added authenticity.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRkMDZlNGUtMzVmMC00Y2UyLTg0YTYtMjAzZmQ2NmQyNjg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyOTc@._V1_UY209_CR1,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

On top of that, he all the while takes great care in preserving his demeanor and status as a gentleman; all the relatives he must eliminate are brought to life by the genius of Alec Guinness; and there's an executioner who takes pains to show proper respect to his social ""superior.""

Many people feel that this film is a miracle, and I have the same feeling, especially when I'm watching it breathlessly from the beginning to its end.Similar to the way the Beatles themselves have created many of their masterpieces, this film is the result of a ""controlled chaos"". Lennon remarked that many of his imagery and lyrics were just conceived off the top of his head, which is precisely the thing that gives them the freshness and spontaneity we adore. Same is with the rich and fulfilling imagery of this film -- it is obviously an outcome of the 'shoot from the hip' approach. It sounds unbelievable, but the film's ending (the most brilliant piece of all), was thrown in during one hectic weekend! Knowing this, it is not surprising to learn that the principal artist who designed the look and feel of the ""Yellow Submarine"" movie, almost went blind after finishing it (he set a grueling schedule of sleeping only four hours every other night during the making of the film! -- it took him several years to regain his health)On a personal level, this film works as some kind of revelation for me. It is impossible to put it into words, but the film stirs the deepest, most contradictory emotions in me. It transcends space and time, and has the ability to bring me into the state where the regular, everyday thoughts do not apply. In that respect, it is as strong as the best Beatles songs.Many criticisms of this movie are sadly missing the point. To criticise the animation as being jerky and unrealistic amounts to criticising Picasso for not painting more photo-realistic canvases. Misses the point entirely. To criticise the understatement-laden dialogue is to miss the finer points of comedy, insisting on the Three Stooges slapstick only. To say that the story line is incoherent is to betray the sitcom-infested mind in the sad state of commercial-induced eating disorder.I must confess that I had approached the viewing of this film with a huge dose of skepticism. I thought it's going to look and feel lame, with a dated and naive hippy/psychedelia cliches. Boy, was I in for a shock!My rating: 11 out of 10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2ODAyZjUtZGMxZS00OGMxLWFjNDYtNGVmNmI1ZGZjNWM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc5NjEzNA@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

The story revolves around Sally Hawkins' remarkable performance as primary school teacher Poppy Cross, a highly unusual character in that Hawkins and Leigh between them manage to make her consistently cheerful and optimistic without being either naive or irritating. Poppy is presented as both relentlessly cheery and, on another level, remarkably intuitive; throughout the film, she has a series of encounters with troubled male figures (a boy in her class who has started bullying, a very strange homeless Irishman and, above all, her phenomenally uptight driving instructor Scott) and in all of them, Poppy's liveliness and friendly curiosity about other people is seen to be a powerful counter to male self-pity, anger and despair.Hawkins' character is not someone who is inclined to let life get her down, so it's just as well that she is surrounded by people with a somewhat more sardonic or downbeat take on reality. Her flatmate Zoe (Alexis Zegerman, very good) is a wonderfully dry and sarky counter to Poppy's enthusiasm, although the affection between them is palpable. Poppy's younger sisters Suzy and Helen are also quite different; Suzy is a law student who is more interested in clubbing, drinking and playing with her brother-in-law's Playstation than in criminal justice, while Helen is heavily pregnant, obsessed with acquiring the trappings of a respectable suburban life and unable to understand how her older sister can be so happy living in a rented flat and not stepping onto the property ladder.The big surprise for me is that I had been led to believe that this is a more or less straightforward feelgood film. It isn't. Scott, Poppy's driving teacher (Eddie Marsan), is the most affecting character in it, and one of the greatest and most unforgettable characters in Leigh's oeuvre. Most of the reviews I've read of the film depict Scott as a hateful, sinister or otherwise despicable character, but although it's true that he is an uptight, judgmental, angry bigot, it is also perfectly clear from his first appearance that he doesn't know what he's talking about and that he is driven by emotional problems that he hasn't even begun to get a handle on. Marsan's extraordinary performance is one of the best things I've seen on film for a long time. Scott has been afflicted with very bad teeth and a mild speech defect (he can't really say the letter 'r') and although his inner anger and bigotry is played for laughs for a lot of the film, in the end it is allowed to blossom forth in a riveting scene where his fury, jealousy and terror of his own darkness spill forth in a heartbreaking and riveting torrent. If part of the point of art is to help us to understand people we would otherwise have little sympathy with, then this film is a work of art. I've never seen Marsan before but he deserves awards for this movie, no question.Happy-Go-Lucky is a highly enjoyable and often very funny film, but it also carries terrible sadness. I have never been a massive fan of Mike Leigh, but lately I have to admit that I was wrong. He just seems to get better and better.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4ODY1MjIyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTExMTM5MQ@@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It's difficult to describe the amount of pleasure that can be gained through Christopher Neame's outrageous performance as Johnny Alucard (Van Helsing's solving of the anagram is one of many magnificent unintentionally comic moments, worthy of Tom Baker at his most insincere).Both Cushing and Lee try desperately to bring a sense of gravitas to the lunatic proceedings (how do vampires survive when it's raining?), but it does become apparent that the series was reaching its natural conclusion.I've laughed so much it's been impossible to stand up during this. Memorable quotes include: ""Dig the music, kids"", ""Foul, ghastly, horrible, obscene murder"" and ""A black mass?  I mean, honestly.""

It was neither good, nor bad. In fact, watching it was very much like being trapped in limbo. There was little to stimulate the audience's minds through most of the movie.It's also irritating to see Hollywood moralising about the evils of cloning through the use of film. I'd hesitate to say it was right, but the last thing reasoned debate on the subject needs is idiot screenwriters cashing in on public fears (and fears that are generated by media misrepresentation, at that) and adding more fuel to the fire. What next, a movie about people turning into flies because they ate genetically modified food crops?This film isn't very good and you won't be seeing it twice even if you do have the foolishness, like me, to watch it once.

Although the film really is an incorporation of two Poe stories....The Masque of the Red Death and Hop-Frog...it is an excellent, atmospheric, quality piece of entertainment.  At the core of the film's strength are the performance of Price as the evil, malignant, malicious Prince Prospero, follower of the devil and cruel sovereign of an area plagued with a all-consuming Red Death, and the fabulous period sets and costumes, many borrowed from the film Beckett.  Price is at his best, and his turn as Prospero easily ranks as his most sinister and wicked performance(closely running against his portrayal of a witch hunter in The Conquerer Worm).  Vincent Price blends outrageous showmanship with intricate subtleties of a man reasoning why he is what he is.  The dialogue certainly is more important than the action in the story...a reason why some viewers(younger ones more than likely) will find film a bit tiresome.

Crips""","I would like to thank all of the fans and supporters of the the film; it pleases me greatly that you got the message. I am a retired (South Central L.A.) English teacher; I wrote the novel ""South Central L.A. Crips(the story of the L.A. Street gang, 1971-1985)"" in 1986 as a roman a clef (faction). ""Deuce"" was a euphemism for ""Crip"" (which was censored in movies in 1991) It had become obvious to me that the old canon of American literature would not inspire the will necessary to become literate for Crips and Bloods and many other lower class African Americans, so I interviewed hundreds of gangsters over a 4 year span and wrote a book about them that would do the job. The movie ""South Central"" was, initially, merely a vehicle to advertise the book and promote the message of literacy. I used the book and the movie in my curriculum for 12 years. Gangsters stole it out of my classroom and the local libraries. I considered it an ironic tribute and an effective way to distribute to the people who needed it the most. But, best of all, L.A.'s gang murder epidemic has been subsiding ever since until it's now lower than it has been in over 30 years. ""South Central"" was made to save lives and I believe it has as ""Variety"" predicted when it came out in the midst of over 1000 murders in 1992. I rushed it to the screen (I signed a 6 month option w/Steve Anderson for $1)because I knew there was a volcano about to erupt in South Central L.A. from teaching 100's of gangsters in the area; I partnered w/Steve and Oliver Stone because they had the sensitivity for the mission and skill to make the film. Unfortunately, ""South Central"", though completed in 1991, was not released until the summer of 1992 after the South Central L.A. Uprising which stigmatized it to the owners of theaters causing it to go from a projected 1200 (approx.) screen opening to less than 100. It was a big success immediately in video stores and on cable. Hopefully, it will last as long as ""Huckleberry Finn"". I am not a ""Hollywood"" writer; although I wrote the novel and collaborated on the screenplay (for which I received no credit), I was not able to join the WGA (I played Dr. King in the movie, so I am in SAG). However, I am honored to have made the film; I, even, believe it is time to remake it for today's audience. I would have liked to: keep it PG-13; eliminated the N-word and profanity; used more of the slang from the novel(""h-nk-ball""?, ""ginawagon""!, please); shown more of the L.A. Islamic influence and local history, obviously Bobby (Jimmie Black in the novel) is changed by copious reading like Malcolm X, and I, being a devout Muslim, wanted to note the great work Muslims have done in prisons (this, too, was pretty much anathema in 1991, but we sneaked it in subliminally). I have written a sequel, ""Inhale Gasoline & Gun Smoke (the story of the L.A. Uprising)"" which is probably too hot for Hollywood but will eventually be made one way or another. I am Executive Producer of SAB Productions and my film ""Bilalian"" shows on BET's Black Stories every now and then.

It was a big picture, it had a great story, it gave a lot of bang for the buck and that has always been a factor in grabbing the Oscar. It does seem a bit dated to us now, used to high flying special effects, different acting styles, and quick cut editing, instead of letting the scene play out as it so often does here, but it's such a great story. The circus itself is a character and the way Demille used the audience to make them seem so individual is wonderful. And I'm not just referring to the Hope/Crosby cameo. Remember the fat guy with the kid scarfing down the ice cream laughing his head off while the kid looked confused? You could tell he was reliving his childhood and he became EveryMan to us with only seconds of screen time. That's mastery. The integration of the real circus people with the actors was seamless and if nothing else this movie captures a time when the circus was really a circus. Carp all you want, guys. But I think you may be too spoiled by ultra realism to appreciate the subtler gems in this very respectable film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg5MWIyMjItYWMyYS00YTFjLWFlZGMtZTJkNzgyY2VmY2U2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzE2NDk3NTY@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

Berserk is one of them.Written and illustrated by the legendary manga artist Kentaro Miura, Berserk (Ã£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂ«Ã£ÂÂ»Ã£ÂÂ«Ã£ÂÂ¯) is an epic fantasy saga that knows no time, no boundaries, and no has end. It tells the story of a Guts (Ã£ÂÂ¬Ã£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂ, Gattsu), a boy born from the corpse of a woman hung on a battlefield, who struggles to fight his unfortunate destiny. Set in a fictional version of medieval Europe, Gatsu is a young mercenary who travels with no direction nor purpose, swinging his huge sword in merciless fights in order to survive. He buries his blade deep into the flesh of his opponents, fighting like a madmen in battle, reminiscent of the nordic berserks, coming closer and closer to death, maybe to finally feel alive. His life is meaningless, his actions have no honor nor reason, except survival. He strives to escape his nature, that of a man born from a dead body, already between this world and the other, with nothing to lose except his miserable life.That is, until he meets Griffith, the impossibly beautiful and charismatic leader of the undefeated mercenary band called ""the Band of the Hawk"" (Ã©Â·Â¹Ã£ÂÂ®Ã¥ÂÂ£ Taka no Dan). This encounter will forever change his life, and that of everyone else.Beware, Berserk is not an ordinary series. It is hard, violent, and not easy to follow. There are no flashbacks constantly reminding you of what happened before, no fill-in episodes, no sweetening of the pill. It is a solid punch of crude reality hitting you in the stomach, and you have no way of guarding yourself. Miura's genius permeates in each page, down to every minute detail. The themes treated are difficult, and never simplified for the sake of the reader. Reality has no shortcuts, no easy way, and that is reflected in the story. The characters in Berserk are genuine, real, endlessly complicated, troubled. They hold secrets, they cheat, murder, conspire, but they are also capable of great kindness. Friendship, ambition, causality, the supernatural, our ambivalent nature, the struggle for power, love and hate. Twenty-two years in, still going strong, in what is possibly one of the greatest stories ever told.With that premise, you would think that the task of turning such a story into a series of animated feature films would be arduous. And you would be right. Only an animation studio capable of immense greatness could be up to the task. STUDIO4ÃÂ°C is one such group.From the opening scene we know what kind of film we are dealing with. A clear, peaceful blue sky is contrasted by the presence of ominous birds flying in circles, while balls of fire fly over them. Guts looks up at the sky with sad eyes, a scar in the middle of his nose and a helmet on his head immediately tell us what he is. A heartless mercenary. The deaden sound of the blasting gives us a hint of where we are. Everything moves slowly, as if underwater, or inside a womb. How appropriate for someone who was born in a battlefield, who is neither truly alive nor dead, until he begins to fight. Gatsu's heart starts pounding, as he watches a black hawk fall down, the sound increases, until the bird drops dead in the middle of the fight, crushed beneath the boots of armed mercenaries, assaulting a castle. That is the time when the sound rises up at full blast, and we are catapulted into the battle.The fight is cruel and violent, unlike anything I have even seen. The Lord of the Rings, Braveheart, Game of Thrones, list what you want, nothing compares to the level of horrifying realism that Berserk has to offer. The animation is top notch, the colours vivid and stunning, you could take any frame from the film, hang it on the wall, and it would work as a painting on itself.The soundtrack by Shiro Sagisu is perfectly calibrated to match the already spectacular animation sequence, the epic chorus elevates the scenes to a sense of greatness, without ever overdoing it. The first eight minutes are a masterpiece of action down to the last second, flawlessly directed by the talented Toshiyuki Kubooka.In every moment we can see something in motion, be it the clouds in the background or the hair on someone's face, the level of maniacal details is lessened only by the overuse of 3D animation (which is a bit irritating at times). But action sequences of crude violence, great animation, and impeccable sound effects are just a spec of dust in the whole opera. The real value lies in the moments of silence, when the characters quietly ponder about their lives, or study each other, looking into their souls. We can see through their fears, their dreams and aspirations, their hate, without them needing to utter many words. And the few words that are spoken weight a million tons.Berserk Golden Age Arc I: The Egg of the King covers volumes 4,5 and half of 6, each of which requires a few hours to read, all delivered in 70 minutes. As you can imagine, they had to make some choices and not everything was included. When this happens, the story usually loses value, the characters are simplified, and everything becomes dull. Surprisingly, this is not the case here. The first part of the Berserk Saga Project, which should cover the Golden Age Arc of Berserk does not disappoint. In fact, it excels, in both execution and presentation. The climatic drama and the anticipated tragedy yet to come reach the peak at the end of the film, accompanied by an epic final score by Susumu Hirasawa.STUDIO4ÃÂ°C has delivered a compelling and engaging story, masterfully animated and directed, which breathed life to Miura's pencil, and gave it voice.

The film revolves primarily around two girls and their interaction between each other and their community. One girl(Unn) is set apart from the rest of her peer group, a loner who is befriended by Siss. As the story unfolds you gain an insight into Unn's character, after sharing a secret with Siss, instead of going to school the next morning Unn wanders off into the snow and disappears. I won't give away the ending of the film, but it is beautifully shot, there are a lot of allegorical references, and the continuity is superb. definitely one for your collection","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2U1Mjg1N2UtOGVmYi00MzVhLWFmYzEtNzU3OGY0MjJkOGRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDMxMTgwOQ@@._V1_UX140_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

It makes the otherwise well intended film unnatural and completely unbelievable, in my mind it turns the film into a B-movie, frankly unbearable to watch. What a waste of good actors! In an age when even HBO has understood that subtitles are indispensable when you want to make your story to be authentic and credible, I think that decision is the worst flaw of the film.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwODJhN2YtMzUwMy00ZjI1LTllNGYtNTA3YTk5MTEyY2M2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ3NzUxOTM@._V1_UY209_CR0,0,140,209_AL_.jpg"

I identified with the main character on numerous levels.  First, the way he responded to his feelings about her; the way he took a chance and ""went for it."" The way he responded to her telegram at the ball. He jumped in his car and drove another few hundred miles to be with her; I have taken an equivalent leap in my own life, and never have regretted it. One doesn't get many such chances in this world. The way he drove again and met her train in Paris.  One must grab for the gold ring when it comes around and hang on.  One must be willing to risk looking ridiculous on occasion in order to have a shot at winning the Big Prize. I know, I'm a hopeless romantic.  I love being a hopeless romantic.
